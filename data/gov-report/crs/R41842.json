Since September 11, 2001, when communications failures contributed to the tragedies of the day, Congress has passed several laws intended to create a nationwide emergency communications capability. The 111th Congress considered pivotal issues, such as radio frequency spectrum license allocation and funding programs for a Public Safety Broadband Network (PSBN), without finding a solution that satisfied the expectations of both public safety and commercial network operators. Congressional initiatives to advance public policies for Next Generation 911 services (NG9-1-1) also remained incomplete. The 112th Congress is under renewed pressure to come to a decision about the assignment of a block of radio frequency spectrum licenses referred to as the D Block, and to provide a plan for federal support of broadband networks for emergency communications. The cost of constructing new networks (wireless and wireline) is estimated by experts to be in the tens of billions of dollars over the long term, with similarly large sums needed for maintenance and operation. Identifying money for federal support in the current climate of budget constraints provides a challenge to policy makers. The greater challenge, however, may be to assure that funds are spent effectively toward the national goals that Congress sets.", "After years of debate, a majority in the public safety community has agreed to implement common technologies using Internet Protocol (IP)-enabled networks and the wireless technology known as Long Term Evolution (LTE) to build a nationwide PSBN. IP-enabled networks are also considered essential to the introduction of NG9-1-1. The adoption of the Internet Protocol for emergency communications represents a significant advance in the technologies available for response and recovery operations. IP-enabled technologies are faster and smarter, capable of analyzing and directing communications as they move through networks. Achieving the transition to a leading-edge, broadband network powered by the next generation of IP technologies requires significant changes in operations and long-standing agency traditions, major investments in infrastructure and radios, and the development of enabling technologies.", "The need appears increasingly urgent for timely decisions by policy makers on new infrastructure for emergency communications and spectrum allocation for public safety radios.

H.R. 3630, Title IV contains provisions, approved in markup on December 1, 2011, by the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, House Committee on Energy and Commerce. H.R. 3630 is under consideration by a conference committee for which a major focus of discussion is an extension of payroll tax cuts and how to fund them. On the Senate side, the legislative response to H.R. 3630 will likely include provisions from the American Jobs Act of 2011 (S. 1549 and others) and from the Public Safety and Wireless Innovation Act (S. 911, as amended, Senator Rockefeller). S. 911 received bi-partisan approval by the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.", "Other legislation that has been introduced in the 112th Congress to address some of these issues includes the Broadband for Public Safety Act of 2011 (S. 1040, Lieberman), and the Broadband for First Responders Act (H.R. 607, King)."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Goals and Challenges", "paragraphs": ["For nearly a decade, Congress and successive Administrations have worked to improve emergency communications across the nation.

The White House has supported allocating additional radio frequency spectrum and funding in support of a new, wireless public safety communications network. This position has received widespread support among the public safety community and some commercial stakeholders, such as the Public Safety Alliance. Proposed federal funding for this solution, however, has raised concerns about the cost to the government. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has proposed a public-private partnership that would use radio frequency spectrum to attract a commercial partner willing to share network infrastructure with public safety entities, reducing costs but also limiting the amount of spectrum capacity under the direct control of public safety agencies. The FCC's plans have received support from the commercial sector and stakeholders and policy makers who believe that it will increase competition and lower costs to all users of wireless networks. The number and variety of conflicting interests have made it difficult for Congress to reach agreement. Of the bills introduced in the 112 th Congress, as of the date of this report, S. 911 , as amended, and the amended Discussion Draft of the Jumpstarting Opportunity with Broadband Spectrum (JOBS) Act of 2011, which has been incorporated in H.R. 3630 , have been reported favorably by committee.", "This report identifies areas where changes in existing policies and practices may facilitate achievement of the important goals for emergency communications that Congress and others have identified.

As radio technologies evolved, there was a growing awareness among first responders\u2014long before 9/11\u2014of the need for better coordination and communications interoperability. Their concerns crystallized after a commercial aircraft crashed into a bridge crossing the Potomac River between Washington, DC, and Arlington County, Virginia, in January 1982. As a result, new planning efforts for multi-jurisdictional and multi-disciplinary responses were put in place across the United States, with federal agencies often providing assistance through technical expertise and funding.", "In 1996, a report was published by the Public Safety Wireless Advisory Committee (PSWAC), which the Federal Communications Commission and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) had created to provide Congress with recommendations on meeting the communications needs of first responders. The committee's Final Report was considered a landmark in planning and goal setting for public safety communications. Post-9/11, the concerns raised by PSWAC received new attention. In 2003, a National Task Force on Interoperability, with the support of the Department of Justice, revisited the PSWAC report findings, reiterating needs such as investment in infrastructure, more funding, better planning, more coordination and cooperation among agencies, and allocation of additional radio frequency spectrum. In 2007, Congress created the Office of Emergency Communications (OEC) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and tasked it with the preparation of a National Emergency Communications Plan (NECP), which was published in 2008. Separately, Congress, also in 2008, required the National E9-1-1 Implementation Coordination Office (ICO) to prepare a national plan for migration to Next Generation 911 (NG9-1-1) and to identify possible actions for Congress to take in advancing goals identified through the planning process. The FCC's 2010 National Broadband Plan included goals for advancing \"robust and secure public safety communications networks.\" All of these planning efforts included a broad base of stakeholders in the process. The plans, separately compiled and administered, have provided much of the basis for current federal policy and technology strategies. The common thread is the stakeholders who have participated in the various planning committees; for example, key public safety associations are consistently represented on these committees.", "The FCC's broadband plan advocated deploying IP-enabled technologies for NG9-1-1 and for wireless broadband networks for public safety radios. Planning efforts for both of these emergency communications have since been initiated by the FCC. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges and Barriers to Change", "paragraphs": ["Although many of the plans developed by federal agencies over the last decade have encouraged statewide and regional planning, the evolutionary path for providing emergency communications has favored local planning over federal, regional, and even state authority. In general, the larger cities and more prosperous counties have taken the lead in deploying new communications systems. Cities and towns with populations of less than 100,000 and rural counties apparently may struggle with implementing modern communications systems. Lack of funds to build infrastructure may not be the only difficulty; often these communities do not have the needed personnel, such as grants administrators or information technology managers, and therefore rely on sharing resources with neighboring counties. ", "The Department of Homeland Security has advocated emergency communications planning from the bottom up, encouraging stakeholders to find their own solutions within frameworks established within DHS, evolving along a development continuum provided by the agency. Although localism offers many benefits for communities, the relative autonomy in choosing technology has led to incompatible equipment and small-scale, inefficient markets for equipment and infrastructure. Emergency communications technology choices have tended to be proprietary, tailored to specific needs of micro-markets, and closed to commercial, mass-market solutions. As a consequence, there is a notable gap between the level of technology available to the typical first responder or 911 call center operator and that used every day by the average American consumer. ", "Today, emergency communications systems are typically local in reach and limited in applications. According to most experts, the emergency communications grid of the not-too-distant future is likely to be local, national, and international in reach, with flexible and accessible applications that can be instantaneously tailored to meet the needs of any emergency situation. The emergency communications technologies of the future are expected to be developed for common IP-enabled platforms that can operate on any IP-enabled network. IP-enabled wireless devices using technologies such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) will deliver advanced services anywhere, any time. ", "Implementation of the next generation of emergency communications technology may alter the patterns of the past 30 years of technology development and adoption for public safety radios and systems. The transition might be facilitated by changes in the management of public safety resources, addressing questions such as the following:", "Who will be responsible for governance?

Congress may therefore choose to consider these and other areas where policy recommendations or legislative actions may expedite improvements to emergency communications."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Governance and Grants", "paragraphs": ["Governance is a broad term that can include a number of factors. At the federal level, governance is closely associated with evaluation of existing programs and the management of federal expenditures, including grants. A number of federal agencies have roles in guiding and monitoring some decisions of states and localities through grant administration. Currently, over 40 active programs, administered by nine different departments and multiple agencies within those departments, are providing grants for funding emergency communications, and guidance and governance for those grants. Within DHS, the Office of Emergency Communications, the SAFECOM Program, and the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) are among the agencies that formulate policies, plan exercises, provide guidelines, and establish requirements. Two major grants programs within the Department of Justice provide funds for emergency communications; these are the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program and the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program. The NTIA administers grants made through the Broadband Technologies Opportunity Program (BTOP), some of which benefit public safety communications and 911 services. The NTIA shared responsibility with the Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, for a 911 grant program established by the ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004. The only federal grant program exclusively for improving 911, its sole appropriations was less than $50 million provided through the Digital Transition and Public Safety Fund, created by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005.", "It is estimated that as much as $13 billion in federal funding, possibly more, was spent on emergency communications from FY2001 through FY2010. This total does not take full account of earmarks and other forms of assistance not reported as grants. Little information about how this money was spent is readily available. ", "Grant programs provide a mechanism for governance by affecting performance and behavior; financial audits and other reviews of expenditures provide oversight. For investments in public safety communications systems and equipment, oversight seems to be mostly within the communities whose first responders use the systems that have been purchased. Federal audits usually are not performed at a level of detail that identifies the specific uses of federal grants by the ultimate recipients of the funds.", "Because new technologies that might benefit public safety communications are being developed and deployed almost exclusively within the commercial sector, one of the considerations for improving governance of emergency communications deployments might be how to manage partnerships between the commercial sector and state and local agencies. In a publicly traded corporation, governance is provided by the board of directors and senior management, who must satisfy the expectations of shareholders and financial markets as well as assure compliance with rules and regulations. A public-private partnership might therefore meld public and private methods of governance. This in turn might lead to a closer examination of the federal role in providing governance and funding. For example, to capture the full advantages from innovation and cost-saving economies of scale, some say transfers of new commercial technologies to public safety agencies should occur on an on-going basis, not as episodic one-time transactions. Federal grants, however, tend to provide for single projects, within a limited timeframe, and may lose some of this efficiency. ", "Other sources of funding in addition to federal grants are available for the building and operation of communications systems. Given the many potential sources of funds available to states and communities, it is debatable whether rules attached to federal grants can be used to drive a process that would coordinate the construction and operation of a seamless, nationwide network to serve first responders and other emergency personnel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Decision Making and Planning Authority", "paragraphs": ["As with federal grant programs for emergency communications, multiple federal agencies are involved in planning and decision-making guidance for state, local, tribal, and regional agencies.

In the case of DHS, authority includes planning and implementing public safety communications solutions and setting requirements to coordinate and support specific goals, such as interoperability and a national communications capability. Within DHS, the Office of Emergency Communications manages statewide planning and coordination for interoperable communications and administers compliance with the National Emergency Communications Plan. FEMA participates in emergency communications planning as part of its state and regional efforts for hazard mitigation and response and recovery. ", "The FCC has several pertinent mandates from Congress, such as an obligation to \"promote safety of life and property through the use of wire and radio communication,\" and requirements regarding the assignment of radio frequencies for public safety use. The FCC created a Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau in 2006 to consolidate its many programs oriented toward public safety. This bureau and the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau jointly administer the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, the chosen license-holder for the public safety broadband frequencies at 700 MHz. The FCC also oversees the activities of 55 Regional Planning Committees that administer spectrum assignments for mission-critical voice networks in the 700 MHz band.

Most states have a Statewide Interoperability Coordinator (SWIC) to administer its Statewide Communication Interoperability Plan (SCIP).

DHS describes SCIPs as \"locally-driven, multi-jurisdictional, and multi-disciplinary statewide plans to enhance emergency communications.\" State coordinators are encouraged to promote a \"coordinated practitioner-driven approach\" through a \"collaborative statewide governance structure.\" Not all grants are coordinated through the SCIP, however. Many earmarks and some grants have been awarded directly to an agency within a town, city, or county for a specific purpose identified by the recipient. A review of federal, state, and local grants programs seems to indicate that most purchasing decisions for emergency communications equipment occur at the county level, often based on an approved equipment list provided by the state or by a regional buyers cooperative. ", "Planning and decision making for emergency communications at the local and county level is often separated by function. Some actions may be coordinated through a planning board, or one office, such as the sheriff's office, will be designated for emergency planning. Federal and state programs may provide specific goals and a framework for coordination. It appears, however, that funds are disbursed and authority is typically dispersed according to the administrative structure of the county, city, or town.

The decision by the FCC to advocate a shared network for wireless communications was centered on two conclusions: (1) that a network with national coverage would best meet public safety needs for robust communications capabilities, information, and interoperability; and (2) that sharing spectrum and network facilities with commercial users would benefit public safety through economies of scale in building, equipping, and operating the network, by providing access to additional spectrum in times of large-scale emergencies, and by offering new sources of funding, among other benefits. Arguments in favor of building a network exclusively for public safety revolve around the shortcomings of current commercial wireless services such as poor availability, inadequate coverage in rural areas, lack of security features, and absence of priority access. Also, public safety representatives have frequently expressed concerns in testimony before Congress about sharing authority with a commercial partner.", "Final decisions by policy makers about the number, location, and type of network (local, state, regional, national) are likely to have a significant impact on commercial participation in a public safety broadband network or networks. Although most public safety representatives object to any sharing arrangement that would allow commercial partners to dictate access to capacity, in general they have advocated leveraging public safety spectrum resources through agreements with commercial partners. The scope of these agreements is undecided. Some agencies envision a national network governed primarily by the Public Safety Broadband Licensee; some prefer linking state and regional networks, with regional boards taking the lead; others assume the solution will be a system of multiple local, county, and state systems similar to what is in place for existing public safety radio systems.", "To maximize the benefits of commercial involvement, the National Emergency Number Association (NENA) in 2009 proposed consolidating the Public Safety Broadband License with the D Block, to be auctioned to commercial operators who would be required to develop public safety enterprises to provide the needed network."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Role of the Emergency Response Interoperability Center and the Public Safety Spectrum Trust", "paragraphs": ["As part of its initial planning for a Public Safety Broadband Network (PSBN), to facilitate interaction between the public and private sectors, the FCC required the creation of a not-for-profit corporation, the Public Safety Broadband Licensee (PSBL) to hold the license for spectrum assigned for public safety broadband. This corporation is presently governed by its board, the composition of which is largely determined by the FCC, with the participation and oversight of two FCC bureaus. As originally envisioned by the FCC, the PSBL would be contractually bound to work with one or more commercial partners to develop a broadband network for public safety use. The FCC awarded the administration of the PSBL to the Public Safety Spectrum Trust (PSST). To work with the PSBL, the commercial sector, and other stakeholders, the FCC created the Emergency Response Interoperability Center (ERIC) within the FCC Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau in April 2010. ERIC was tasked with implementing standards for national interoperability and developing technical and operational procedures for the public safety wireless broadband network in the 700 MHz band. ", "The national license currently assigned to the PSST for a broadband network is for 10 MHz within the 700 MHz band. Until plans are finalized for the PSBN, the FCC has provided conditional waivers for some agencies that wish to move forward with broadband network deployment. Agencies in eight states, five counties or regions, and eight cities received waivers, which required them to meet network requirements as specified by the FCC. The FCC then approved agreements for 20 of the waiver recipients to lease spectrum from the PSST to cover their planned areas of operation. Transferring spectrum management rights to these jurisdictions effectively assigned much of the decision-making authority and funding responsibility to them as\u00a0well. ", "Based on FCC plans, however, ERIC and the PSST will do most of the planning for the PSBN; future grants intended for the PSBN would have to be used in accordance with the network plans developed by the FCC through ERIC. The FCC, therefore, would be the lead agency for grants guidance, governance, planning, and some decision making for the PSBN. The level of decision-making power that the FCC will be able to wield depends largely on the outcome of its negotiations with the PSST and other public safety stakeholders, possibly bolstered or constrained by congressional action. ", "Given the apparent expectations of many stakeholders that there will be commercial participation in building and operating a nationwide network for public safety broadband communications, it might be useful to develop specific guidelines for these partnerships at the beginning of the network planning process. For example, it is not clear whether the PSBL will take the lead in negotiations and contractual agreements with commercial partners or whether decisions regarding these agreements will be left largely to states, or localities, as has been the case in the past.", "Although the FCC would appear to have authority over the process of planning and decision making for the PSBN, it may come under pressure from stakeholders, including Congress, to share responsibilities.

The average expenditure, per state, for states providing estimates of their projected costs, was reported to be $160 million. In 2008, NEMA reported that the states' estimates of the cost of providing interoperable communications nationwide had risen to a total of $12 billion since the 2006 report.

Although the FCC did not provide details of how the D Block would be auctioned, it did prepare estimates of the cost to public safety if infrastructure was shared. These estimates were based on assumptions that include (1) 95% of the towers used in the PSBN would be shared with commercial operators; (2) backhaul would be shared and paid for separately; (3) the new network would be data and video only; and (4) LTE would be the wireless technology used.

Questions related to policy issues raised in this report include the possible impact of proprietary broadband technologies on", "network and device equipment costs borne by public safety relative to commercial costs;", "the ability for public safety to benefit from innovation in wireless technologies;", "the likelihood of terminated product lines or new mandatory releases that result in unique costs to public safety relative to commercial technologies;", "public safety interoperability at the application, devices, and network levels among networks provisioned by different vendors;", "the ability of public safety users to enter into partnerships with commercial wireless providers;", "competition in the public safety communications equipment market; and", "the FCC's National Broadband Plan finding that encouraged incentive-based partnerships with a variety of commercial operators.", "The FCC responded to this letter in mostly general terms, citing, for example that the waiver process is in its early stages. The FCC response noted that issues similar to those raised by the committee letter are being examined in the Interoperability Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking . The FCC's primary focus has been to develop rules to ensure technical interoperability nationwide for the public safety broadband network, even if proprietary technologies are used. The FCC reply noted that, of the 20 waiver recipients, only two had selected a vendor, and another eight were in the process of identifying and selecting a vendor.

Meanwhile, states and localities have continued to apply to the FCC for waivers that would permit them to obtain sub-licenses from the PSST and commence building their own networks. Any IP-enabled network, however, can support virtual private networks in wired or wireless infrastructure. The most important consideration for assured access, therefore, is not network ownership but network availability, permitting the uninterrupted transfer of communications to an operational link when part of a network fails. Sharing infrastructure between public safety and commercial license-holders, as proposed by the FCC, would lower costs and increase national availability by providing access to commercial networks. A nationwide public safety network, with a small number of operational cores operated by and for public safety agencies, as proposed by NPSTC, would increase network availability and facilitate cost-saving measures for participating public safety agencies. Turning over network construction and operations to the commercial sector, as NENA has proposed, might lower costs even further but might also limit public safety access, unless strict rules for meeting capacity needs are in place. If multiple jurisdictions build their own public safety broadband networks, not only might the total cost of providing capacity increase significantly but also available capacity might be diminished because of the added complexity of coordinating interoperable access. The choice of design for the network, therefore, may have an impact on the amount of funding and the length of time needed to construct an interoperable network that can be accessed nationwide.", "Once governance and decision-making authority can be conclusively decided, it may be possible to provide the nation not just with a plan, but with a network design that provides a more solid basis for cost estimates and for plans for funding. States and localities, for example, might benefit from a better sense of their future financial obligations in the construction and operation of a broadband network that is to provide access to public safety agencies across the country.", "Public safety agencies have multiple obligations to build or upgrade, and equip, other networks. The costs of building and maintaining a new data network, therefore, are some fraction of total obligations to assure emergency communications capabilities.

Other sources of funding for emergency communications include appropriations from state and local budgets, financing from government bonds, grants from private foundations, lease-purchase agreements with equipment suppliers, and sources of recurring revenue such as fines, user fees, surcharges, and state and local sales and property taxes. At the local level, funds are often collected through bake sales, fish fries, fund-raising drives, and other community-supported efforts. ", "Testimony at congressional hearings and other public statements by public safety officials indicate that many public safety agencies envisage setting up a partnership with commercial network operators that would provide some form of revenue. How this would be accomplished has been left vague. Possible models to generate revenue from public safety spectrum assets include issuing secondary licenses to commercial partners, and network management techniques that use advanced technologies to share spectrum. ", "The final decision as to how spectrum access might be divided up across an estimated 65,000 public safety agencies has not yet been made by the stakeholders. Some municipalities and states may seek commercial partnerships that will provide access to public safety spectrum in return for financial consideration. Resources provided by the commercial sector might include access to their infrastructure and cash payments for spectrum leases. The value to commercial operators of spectrum access would likely depend on the geographical coverage being offered by the public safety licensee. Paradoxically, the areas where the spectrum is likely to have the most value, such as urban areas, are also the areas where public safety agencies are most likely to need spectrum capacity for their own use. Leased or shared spectrum in small or isolated communities may have little commercial value. ", "The monetary value of spectrum licenses might also be captured for public safety communications expenses by using the proceeds from commercial license auctions. Several proposals, including proposed legislation, would designate all or part of the proceeds of some auctions to funding public safety communications investments and operating costs. These proceeds would be deposited in a special fund; grants administrators would be allowed to borrow against anticipated future revenue so that grants could be provided immediately. ", "Congress has twice in the past acted to create special funds to receive and distribute revenue from spectrum auctions for specific purposes. These funds represent a departure from existing law, which requires that auction proceeds be credited directly to the Treasury as income. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-171 , Title III) required the auctioning of licenses for spectrum used by television broadcasters for analog transmissions. It established the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund to receive this auction revenue and use some of the proceeds for the transition to digital television, public safety communications, and other programs. The Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act ( P.L. 108-494 , Title II) established a Spectrum Relocation Fund to hold the proceeds of certain spectrum auctions for the specific purpose of reimbursing federal entities for the costs of moving to new frequency assignments. ", "Current law prohibits the FCC from considering potential spectrum revenue in planning auctions of spectrum licenses, yet high auction yields may be necessary to sustain the proposed grant programs. Furthermore, although auctions of spectrum licenses are an effective solution for implementing today's wireless technologies, spectrum management policies might change to accommodate the technologies of tomorrow, with less reliance on auctions as a policy tool. It may be that additional congressional oversight is required to assure that the maximum national value is obtained from national spectrum assets.", "Using revenue generated by the sale of radio frequency spectrum to fund wireless networks might increase the proportion of federal money available for one-time investments in infrastructure and therefore the federal role in decision making. This, however, might require transferring authority from states and communities to federal agencies, leading to a greater level of federal participation than is currently the case. States and localities might be hard pressed to muster the resources needed to participate.

For example, within the 700 MHz band, 24 MHz has been assigned for public safety use, of which 10 MHz is currently designated for a new broadband network. Networks primarily for mission-critical voice communications are being constructed separately on 12 MHz of public safety's allotment within the 700 MHz band. Construction of these voice networks, referred to as narrowband networks, is being coordinated largely between states and counties, with counties and major cities typically taking responsibility for building on the spectrum assigned to them for that purpose. ", " Figure 1 represents part of the upper 700 MHz band, indicating the frequencies assigned for public safety and adjacent commercial licenses. The accompanying legend provides the key to the type of license and the amount of spectrum associated with that spectrum. For example, reading from the left, the first band represents 11 MHz of the C Block, which is for commercial purposes. The C Block allocation is in two 11-MHz assignments, at 746-757 MHz and at 776-787MHz. The D Block has two assignments of 5 MHz each; these are contiguous with the two assignments for the Public Safety Broadband License. The D Block frequencies have not yet been auctioned or otherwise assigned. Assigning the 10 MHz D Block for the Public Safety Broadband Network would increase the broadband network's coverage to 20 MHz. Not all spectrum blocks in the 700 MHz band are shown in Figure 1 ; other commercial licenses are in Bands A and B in the lower part of the band.

Part of the challenge for network developers will be to coordinate the development of public safety requirements for LTE with commercial LTE standards development. ", "Coordinating development of 700 MHz band standards among network participants provides an opportunity to maximize the benefits inherent in IP-enabled networks for the safety of the general public. For example, it is possible to create smart phone applications that can link personal mobile devices to emergency command centers, integrating information from those devices into an action plan for response and recovery. The first first responders\u2014the people at the site of a disaster\u2014can be enabled to participate proactively in the response. The feasibility of using crowd-sourced communications to provide information to emergency management command centers is being tested by a program undertaken jointly by the Los Angeles County Homeland Security Advisory Council and the Annenberg Innovation Lab: the CrisisConnection Project. ", "The CrisisConnection Project, as described by Professor Gabriel Kahn, a faculty associate at the Innovation Lab who is leading the development team, will encourage businesses and others in the Los Angeles area to download a smart phone app or register a cell phone number. When a disaster strikes, a user can snap a photo of damage, such as a downed power line from a storm or a collapsed building in an earthquake. A geo-location function then pinpoints where and when the photo was taken. That information is uploaded onto a network. A mapping function places the photo on a map accessible from the web. Other information, such as the names of people who were able to exit a building before it collapsed or whether a city street is still receiving its water supply, can also be uploaded. All the information is aggregated onto one map. ", "Fully implemented, the data might help emergency situation managers determine where to most effectively deploy emergency medical service personnel, firefighters, HazMat teams, utility repair crews, or other response and recovery personnel, as appropriate. As a situation stabilizes, evaluations about evacuation routes, shelters, and other post-disaster services could be expedited and information disseminated through emergency alert systems. The site can be used to support local 911 call center operators and link to NG9-1-1 networks for broader coverage. ", "The scope of such life-saving measures would be greatly facilitated by effective network-to-network wireless communications. For example, federal policy regarding access to the LTE networks being built in the 700 MHz band might include requirements to leverage these spectrum assets for a nationwide emergency communications grid that meets the safety needs of the public at large. ", "One the goals of effective spectrum management is to create opportunities for the development of innovative technologies. Wireless technology transforms air into desirable services, providing an engine for economic growth and development. The evolution of public safety communications has lagged behind the commercial sector and the military in receiving the benefits of recent innovations.

Public safety also uses unlicensed spectrum for local voice and data networks. These networks and other communications solutions have been built separately, use different technologies, and support different radios.", "The commercial sector, meanwhile, has begun the transition to operating almost exclusively on IP-enabled networks such as LTE.

Proposals for Spectrum Assignment", "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is the only federal agency to propose a national network for public safety communications infrastructure and to take action to plan, implement, and fund it. The FCC has proposed a public-private partnership to build a broadband network to benefit public safety. Its proposal would incorporate obligations into auction rules for a commercial network operator that would provide for a shared, national network using public safety and commercial frequencies at 700 MHz. Planning for the network would be conducted on a nationwide basis. To create the partnership, the FCC provided for two national licenses of 10 MHz each. One license was assigned to a Public Safety Broadband Licensee (PSBL). The 10-MHz license held by the PSBL is part of the 24 MHz originally assigned to public safety. The other license\u2014designated the Upper Block D, or D Block\u2014was scheduled for auction in 2008 to a commercial provider. At the auction, the FCC's requirements could not be met by any bidder. The failure to find a commercial partner to work with the public safety license-holder effectively reset the planning process to zero. The FCC decided to include an assessment of public safety broadband needs as part of its preparation of a national broadband plan, as required by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. With a public notice released September 28, 2009, the FCC sought information about current and potential future use of broadband in public safety communications.", "As stated above, after the auction of the D Block failed in early 2008, the FCC issued a new request for comments on how to restructure the auction to provide a network that would meet public safety needs. This led to a host of new suggestions on how to use the spectrum. The FCC's choices, however, are constrained by provisions of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 that require it to auction the D Block. Many of the options proposed to the FCC might therefore require Congress to amend the act or to introduce other enabling legislation.", "Comments filed with the FCC have opened debates about alternative courses of action. Although there are a number of different proposals, each in some way addresses the question of whether it will be public safety representatives or commercial owners and network operators that control the decision-making process. The following is a summary of proposals under discussion and possible agency or legislative actions that might be needed to implement them. Other options may be proposed or developed.", "Auction the D Block to Commercial Interests", "Agree to new rules for a D Block auction that satisfy the key goals laid out by the FCC for a shared network that benefits both public safety users and commercial interests. The D Block might be auctioned as a single, national license or as many licenses assigned to specific geographic areas. The FCC has the authority to structure such an auction under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, including the amendments provided by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. This approach was recommended by the FCC. Auction the D Block without any obligations to share with public safety. Public safety agencies could eventually add broadband applications to communications systems built in the 24 MHz of frequencies originally assigned to them. The FCC has the authority to facilitate this decision. Auction the D Block without any obligations to share with public safety and \"give\" the auction proceeds to public safety, possibly by transferring it to an existing grants program. One program that has been mentioned is the Public Safety Interoperable Communication (PSIC) grant program set up by a provision in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. Congress might choose to amend the provisions for grants in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 or it might choose to create new legislation specifically for the distribution of the D Block auction proceeds. In either case, the cost of new authorizations would be scored by the Congressional Budget Office. Except where Congress has provided for exceptions, the Communications Act of 1934 states that, as a general rule, auction proceeds are deposited in the U.S. Treasury.", "Assign the D Block to Public Safety Licensees", "Assign the D Block to the Public Safety Broadband Licensee to administer as part of plans for a nationwide, interoperable broadband network for public safety. Because the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 included the D Block frequencies among those that the FCC was required to auction, it appears that Congress must amend the law in order for this particular option to be exercised. Assign the D Block to the Public Safety Broadband Licensee for administration and provide federal grants to state, local or regional agencies to build and operate the network. This approach, which would include spectrum license auctions as a source of revenue, has been endorsed by the Obama Administration and is included in its 2012 Budget. Assign the D Block to state, local, or regional network managers. These would negotiate with commercial partners on how to build, operate, and fund a shared network. This action would require agreement among the participants on how to assure nationwide interoperability of the separate networks. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee would provide matching sub-licenses for its spectrum holdings in those areas. Combine the D Block with the existing public safety broadband license and award the license to a new not-for-profit corporation set up for the purpose of building and administering the public safety broadband network.

Funds from the auction proceeds might go to public safety through a program established for that purpose. In addition to legislation that would establish the funding program, Congress might need to amend language in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 that directed the FCC to assign 24 MHz from the 700 MHz band to public safety.", "Appendix C. Congressional Efforts on Behalf of Public Safety Communications", "Many of the statutes passed since 2001 have provided guidelines and set performance goals for public safety communications while delegating decisions about implementation to federal agencies and state officials. Although Congress has appropriated money for public safety communications, it has not directly addressed the question of investment in network infrastructure, leaving it largely to federal agencies to set priorities for how public safety grants can be used. Grants for emergency communications have been used to purchase equipment that facilitates interoperability, for planning, and for training. ", "Congress first addressed the issue of emergency communications interoperability in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by providing additional radio frequency spectrum that would allow for interoperable networks. Provisions intended to improve interoperable functions in public safety networks were included in the Homeland Security Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-296 ). Two years later, responding to recommendations of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (9/11 Commission), Congress included a section in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-458 ) that expanded its requirements for action in improving interoperability and public safety communications. Also in response to a recommendation by the 9/11 Commission, Congress set a firm deadline for the release of radio frequency spectrum needed for public safety radios, as part of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-171 ). These laws provided the base from which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) might develop a national public safety communications capability as required by the Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2007 ( P.L. 109-295 ). Title VI, Subtitle D of the act, referred to as the 21 st Century Emergency Communications Act of 2006, placed new requirements on DHS. Additional requirements were included in the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 ( P.L. 110-53 ).", "Balanced Budget Act of 1997", "The initial allocation to public safety of frequencies in the 700 MHz band was required by Congress in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 ( P.L. 105-33 ), which directed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to designate 24 MHz of spectrum capacity for public safety. To carry out the process of assigning this newly allocated spectrum asset, the FCC created the Public Safety National Coordination Committee (NCC) as a Federal Advisory Committee. Active from 1999 through 2003, the NCC had a Steering Committee from government, the public safety community, and the telecommunications industry. The NCC developed technical and operational recommendations for the 700 MHz band, including plans for interoperable channels. The existing governance for these channels is through Regional Planning Committees (RPCs), established and loosely coordinated by the FCC, with the participation of the National Public Safety Telecommunications Council (NPSTC), a group consisting primarily of public safety associations. The RPCs are responsible for submitting 700 MHz band plans to the FCC for approval, and for managing these plans.", "The Homeland Security Act of 2002 and Actions by the Department", "Provisions of the Homeland Security Act instructed DHS to address some of the issues concerning public safety communications in emergency preparedness and response and in providing critical infrastructure. Telecommunications for first responders is mentioned in several sections, with specific emphasis on technology for interoperability.", "The newly created DHS placed responsibility for interoperable communications within the Directorate for Science and Technology, reasoning that the focus of DHS efforts would be on standards and on encouraging research and development for communications technology. Responsibility to coordinate and rationalize federal networks, and to support interoperability, had previously been assigned to the Wireless Public SAFEty Interoperable COMmunications Program\u2014called Project SAFECOM\u2014by the Office of Management and Budget as an e-government initiative. With the support of the George W. Bush Administration, SAFECOM was placed in the Science and Technology directorate and became the lead agency for coordinating federal programs for interoperability. The Secretary of Homeland Security assigned the responsibility of preparing a national strategy for communications interoperability to the Office of Interoperability and Compatibility (OIC), which DHS created, an organizational move that was later ratified by Congress in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act. SAFECOM continued to operate as an entity within the OIC, which assumed the leadership role.

Furthermore, high-risk urban areas such as New York City and Washington, D.C., should establish signal corps units to ensure communications connectivity between and among civilian authorities, local first responders, and the National Guard. Federal funding of such units should be given high priority by Congress.", "Congress addressed both the context and the specifics of the recommendation for signal corps capabilities. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act amended the Homeland Security Act to specify that DHS give priority to the rapid establishment of interoperable capacity in urban and other areas determined to be at high risk from terrorist attack. The Secretary of Homeland Security was required to work with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Secretary of Defense, and the appropriate state and local authorities to provide technical guidance, training, and other assistance as appropriate. Minimum capabilities were to be established for \"all levels of government agencies,\" first responders, and others, including the ability to communicate with each other. The act further required the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish at least two trial programs in high-threat areas. The process of development for these programs was to contribute to the creation and implementation of a national model strategic plan. The purpose was to foster interagency communications at all levels of the response effort. Building on the concept of using the Army Signal Corps as a model, the law directed the Secretary to consult with the Secretary of Defense in the development of the test projects, including review of standards, equipment, and protocols.", "Congress also raised the bar for performance and accountability, setting program goals for the Department of Homeland Security. Briefly, the goals were to:", "Establish a comprehensive, national approach for achieving interoperability; Coordinate with other federal agencies; Develop appropriate minimum capabilities for interoperability; Accelerate development of voluntary standards; Encourage open architecture and commercial products; Assist other agencies with research and development; Prioritize, within DHS, research, development, testing and related programs; Establish coordinated guidance for federal grant programs; Provide technical assistance; and Develop and disseminate best practices.", "The act included a requirement that any request for funding from DHS for interoperable communications \"for emergency response providers\" be accompanied by an Interoperable Communications Plan, approved by the Secretary. Criteria for the plan were also provided in the act.", "The act also provided a sense of Congress that the next Congress\u2014the 109 th \u2014should pass legislation supporting the Commission's recommendation to expedite the release of spectrum.

The MOU included an overview of how the Public Safety Interoperable Communications (PSIC) Grant Program, as it is called, is to be administered. The overview was reiterated and explained in testimony. Both the MOU and the testimony indicate that the priority was to fund needs identified through Tactical Interoperable Communications Plans and Statewide Interoperable Plans developed in conjunction with SAFECOM. ", "On July 18, 2007, the Secretaries of Commerce and Homeland Security jointly announced the details of the PSIC grant program. The program, as announced, was to provide $968,385,000 in funding for all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Territories. The announcement of the top-level, statewide allocations met the September 30 deadline set by Congress. The states were required to submit brief descriptions of envisioned projects and how grant requirements and guidelines would be met. One of the requirements was that states must have a Statewide Communication Interoperability Plan (SCIP) that has been approved by DHS's Office of Emergency Communications. Actual expenditure amounts are reported as states tap their allocations. Under current law, the states and eligible territories have until the end of FY2011, with a possible extension to 2012, to use the funds made available to them. ", "In 2010, an audit by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), Department of Commerce, provided PSIC grant amounts and drawdowns by state through March 31, 2010. At that time the drawdowns amounted to 31% of the $968.4 million made available through the PSIC program. The OIG has undertaken audits of PSIC grants in nine states that provide some information on how the grant money is being used. ", "The Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2007", "The destruction caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in August-September 2005 reinforced the recognition of the need for providing interoperable, interchangeable communications systems for public safety and also revealed the potential weaknesses in existing systems to withstand or recover from catastrophic events. Testimony at numerous hearings following the hurricanes suggested that DHS was responding minimally to congressional mandates for action, most notably as expressed in the language of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act. Bills subsequently introduced in both the House and the Senate proposed strengthening emergency communications leadership and expanding the scope of the efforts for improvement. Some of these proposals were included in Title VI of the Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2007 ( P.L. 109-295 ). Title VI\u2014the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006\u2014reorganized the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), gave the agency new powers, and clarified its functions and authorities within DHS.", "The act also addressed public safety communications in Title VI, Subtitle D\u2014the 21 st Century Emergency Communications Act of 2006. This section created an Office of Emergency Communications (OEC) and the position of Director, reporting to the Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and Communications. The Director was required to take numerous steps to coordinate emergency communications planning, preparedness, and response, particularly at the state and regional level. These efforts were to include coordination with Regional Administrators appointed by the FEMA Administrator to head 10 Regional Offices. To assist these efforts, Congress required the creation of Regional Emergency Communications Coordination (RECC) Working Groups.", "Other responsibilities assigned to the Director included conducting outreach programs, providing technical assistance, coordinating regional working groups, promoting the development of standard operating procedures and best practices, establishing nonproprietary standards for interoperability, developing a national communications plan, working to assure operability and interoperability of communications systems for emergency response, and reviewing grants. Required elements of the National Emergency Communications Plan (NECP) included establishing requirements for assessments and reports, and an evaluation of the feasibility of developing a mobile communications capability modeled on the Army Signal Corps. The feasibility study was to be done by DHS on its own or in cooperation with the Department of Defense. Congress also required assessments of emergency communications capabilities, including an inventory that identified radio frequencies used by federal departments and agencies. The completed National Emergency Communications Plan set goals for improving emergency communications and interoperability but did not address developing a network infrastructure for public safety communications or for using the 700 MHz spectrum for that purpose. ", "To support its vision of interoperability as a system of systems, DHS sponsored an Emergency Response Council (ERC) composed of several dozen agencies, associations, and other entities involved in public safety and emergency response planning. In 2007 the ERC provided a set of agreements on a Nationwide Plan for Interoperable Communications. The ERC published 12 guiding principles deemed essential to their key goals of forging partnerships, designing interoperable systems, educating policymakers, and allocating resources. To date, the council's role has been primarily to establish a base for advocacy and communication among representatives of public safety agencies and associations. ", "Regional Emergency Communication Coordination", "In P.L. 109-295 , Congress directed the OEC to coordinate with the Regional Emergency Communication Coordination (RECC) Working Groups established by FEMA. These groups were to provide a platform for coordinating emergency communications plans among states and were intended to include representatives from many sectors with responsibility for public safety and security. Plans for forming RECCs were announced in December 2007. In 2008 organization charts were developed, graphing how the RECCs were structured and where they would fit in the existing chain-of-command of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). A National RECC Coordinator was appointed and plans were announced to appoint administrators for each of the regions. ", "A key proposal for the RECC structure is to \"Establish and use the RECC's as a single Federal emergency communications coordination point for Federal interaction with the State, local and tribal governments.\" Congress placed an emphasis on assisting first responders in its statement of RECC goals but did not limit the RECCs' ability to set more inclusive goals. Although the RECCs might be an effective conduit for interaction to develop policies and plan for shared infrastructure, they are currently used primarily as a forum for FEMA's Disaster Operations Directorate to relay guidelines and orders. Based on the role of RECCs as assigned by the National Emergency Communications Plan, their focus will be on assisting first responders to prepare for disaster response. Leadership will be provided by FEMA and governance will be through the chain-of-command of the agencies' directorates.", "The formation of the regional working groups, the RECCs, responded in part to requests from the public safety community to expand interoperable communications planning to include the second tier of emergency workers. Nonfederal members of the RECC are to include first responders, state and\u00a0local officials and emergency managers, and public safety answering points (911 call centers). Additionally, RECC working groups are to coordinate with a variety of communications providers (such as wireless carriers and cable operators), hospitals, utilities, emergency evacuation transit services, ambulance services, amateur radio operators, and others as\u00a0appropriate.", "National Emergency Communications Plan", "In compliance with requirements of the Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2007, the Department of Homeland Security issued the National Emergency Communications Plan (NECP) in July 2008. ", "The NECP sets three goals for levels of interoperability", "By 2010, 90% of all areas designated within the Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI) will demonstrate response-level emergency communications, as defined in grant programs, within one hour for routine events involving multiple jurisdictions and agencies. By 2011, 75% of non-UASI will have achieved the goal set for UASIs. By 2013, 75% of all jurisdictions will be able to demonstrate response-level emergency communications within three hours for a significant incident as outlined in national planning scenarios.", "These jurisdictional goals are to be knit together into a national communications capability through program efforts such as FEMA's Regional Emergency Communications Coordination (RECC) Working Group. The three goals are bolstered by seven objectives for improving emergency communications for first responders, dealing largely with organization and coordination. Each of these objectives has \"Supporting Initiatives\" and milestones."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
