Efforts to support an end to the country's myriad conflicts and human rights abuses have dominated the agenda, as have counterterrorism concerns. When unified (1956-2011), Sudan was Africa's largest nation by area, bordering nine countries and stretching from the northern borders of Kenya and Uganda to the southern borders of Egypt and Libya. Strategically located along the Nile River and the Red Sea, Sudan was historically described as a crossroads between the Arab world and Africa. Domestic and international efforts to unite the country's ethnically, racially, religiously, and culturally diverse population under a common national identity fell short, however, and in 2011, after decades of civil war and a six-year transitional period, Sudan split in two. Mistrust between the two Sudans\u2014Sudan and South Sudan\u2014lingers, and unresolved disputes and related security issues still threaten to pull the two countries back to war.", "The north-south split did not resolve other simmering Sudanese conflicts, notably in Darfur, Blue Nile, and Southern Kordofan. Roughly 3.7 million people are displaced, internally or as refugees, by violence in these areas. Like the rest of the Sahel, Sudan is susceptible to drought and food insecurity, despite significant agricultural potential in some areas. Civilians in conflict zones are particularly vulnerable. Instability and government restrictions limit relief agencies' access to conflict-affected populations. Logistical challenges, particularly during seasonal rains, also constrain access to those who have fled to remote refugee camps in South Sudan. The internal conflict that unfolded in South Sudan in late 2013 further threatens access to those refugees, and has led more than 146,000 South Sudanese to flee into Sudan. Harassment of aid workers is a problem in both countries, further hindering aid responses.", "The peaceful separation of Sudan and South Sudan was seen by some as an opportunity to repair relations between Sudan's Islamist government and the United States. Those ties have long been strained over Khartoum's human rights violations and history of relations with terrorist groups. Among the arguments in favor of normalizing relations has been the notion that the United States, given robust sanctions already in place, has few additional unilateral \"sticks\" to apply. Advocates have argued that certain \"carrots,\" such as easing sanctions or elevating the level of diplomatic engagement, might advance U.S. policy goals. Efforts by the Obama Administration to improve relations, given Sudan's reported counterterrorism cooperation and acceptance of South Sudan's separation, have been impeded by reports of ongoing abuses, including allegations that Sudan continues to commit war crimes against civilians. Diplomatic relations are also complicated by the fact that several Sudanese officials, notably President Omar al Bashir, stand accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide at the International Criminal Court.", "In 2014, under domestic and international pressure to address calls for reform and to resolve ongoing conflicts, President Bashir announced a National Dialogue, under which the government would engage opposition and civil society groups on the development of a new constitution. The African Union, the United Nations, the Obama Administration and other international actors expressed cautious support for the initiative, although the extent of the government's commitment to major political reforms remains unclear, and efforts to facilitate the participation of armed opposition groups in the process have been, to date, unsuccessful. Major opposition parties boycotted elections held in April 2015; President Bashir was reelected with 94% of the vote.", "This report provides an overview of political, economic, and humanitarian conditions, examines conflict dynamics in the country, and outlines U.S. policy and congressional engagement."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Congress has a long history of engagement on U.S. policy toward Sudan\u2014since the end of apartheid in South Africa, there is no country in Africa on which Congress has focused more sustained attention. This bipartisan focus has been driven in part by diverse advocacy groups and public awareness campaigns on issues in Sudan ranging from famine to modern-day slavery, religious persecution, genocide, and other violations of human rights and humanitarian law. Terrorism concerns have overlapped the policy debates.", "Prior to the secession of South Sudan, Sudan was Africa's largest nation by area, and the site of its longest running civil war. In 2011, after decades of fighting broadly described as a conflict between the \"Arab\" Muslim north and \"African\" Christian and animist south, the country split in two. Mistrust between Sudan and South Sudan lingers, and unresolved disputes still threaten the stability of the region. The north-south split did not resolve other simmering Sudanese conflicts, notably in Darfur, Blue Nile, and Southern Kordofan (see Figure 1 ). Overlapping struggles between security forces and armed groups, among ethnic groups, and between nomadic and farming communities have caused extensive displacement and human suffering. Across the country, social tensions, economic pressures, and political dissent pose ongoing challenges for the Islamist government that came to power through a coup in 1989. ", "The secession of South Sudan was a major financial blow to Sudan, which lost 75% of its oil production, two-thirds of its export earnings, and half of its fiscal revenues. The country carries a heavy external debt burden of $45 billion (78% of GDP), much of it in arrears. Khartoum's internal military operations against restive regions continue to draw international condemnation and have prevented Sudan from improving relations with many Western countries, including the United States. U.S. sanctions limit Sudan's access to U.S. dollars and, alongside debt arrears, impede Sudan's access to international financial markets and institutions. After the United States levied heavy fines against the French bank BNP Paribas in 2014 for violating U.S. sanctions against Sudan and other countries, most foreign banks stopped transacting with Sudanese banks, tightening the foreign exchange market and adversely affecting its trade. The International Monetary Fund anticipates that the breakdown in relations with correspondent banks could have a \"considerable negative impact on the economy.\" The ongoing cost of waging war on multiple fronts compounds Sudan's economic troubles and, combined with allegations of political repression, fuels domestic criticism of the government and sparks periodic public protests. ", "Relations between Sudan and key Arab Gulf countries, which have been important sources of trade, investment, and project financing for Khartoum, had cooled in recent years amid some Arab countries' concerns over Sudan's ties to Iran and its perceived support for the Muslim Brotherhood in other countries. Khartoum has since taken several conspicuous steps to address concerns about its relationship with Iran, including by expelling Iran's cultural attach\u00e9 in September 2014 and closing its cultural centers in the country. The extent of its security association with Iran, however, remains subject to speculation. Iranian warships make routine port visits, and the two countries have a long history of diplomatic and military ties. Iran has reportedly played a significant role in the development of Sudan's military industry (Sudan now ranks as the third largest weapons manufacturer on the continent, after Egypt and South Africa). The two countries also reportedly have been involved in weapons smuggling to Gaza, and Israel has reportedly conducted several air strikes in Sudan to disrupt the route. Periodic allegations of Sudanese support for Islamist militias in neighboring Libya may also have contributed to strains in Sudan's relations with some countries, including Egypt. Many observers speculate that Sudan's decision in March 2015 to join the Saudi-led regional military intervention in Yemen, against Houthi rebels reportedly backed by Iran, may be motivated in part by an effort to reinvigorate Arab confidence and investment in Sudan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["After Sudan gained independence from Anglo-Egyptian rule in 1956, successive governments in Khartoum perpetuated development disparities between the north and south that were, in part, a legacy of colonial administration. Northern \"Arab\"-led regimes espousing Islamist ideals have dominated Sudan's political history since independence, often pursuing policies to press distant provinces to conform to the political and sometimes sectarian priorities of the center, Khartoum, rather than accommodating the country's diverse local customs and institutions. Instead of forging a common national identity, these policies have exacerbated Sudan's racial, cultural, and religious differences. Government efforts to Arabize and Islamize the countryside met with resistance from southerners and other marginalized groups, sparking two related insurgencies in the south (1955-1972 and 1983-2005). Groups in other regions have risen up periodically, citing local grievances. In the 1980s, for example, minority groups in the ethnically diverse central states of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile joined the southern rebellion, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A). ", "Revenues from Sudan's oil reserves, which were discovered in 1978 in southern Sudan, primarily benefitted the north, in particular state elites in Khartoum. Oil money also financed the government's countering of domestic insurgencies with force\u2014first in the south, and then also in the west and east. These counter-insurgency campaigns did not discriminate between fighters and civilians, and the government repeatedly questioned the neutrality of international aid agencies and restricted access to affected populations. The rebel groups persisted, and among them the SPLA was the most successful in gaining ground against the more heavily armed Sudanese military. The SPLA faced internal divisions in the 1990s, largely along ethnic lines; Khartoum fueled these splits by arming breakaway factions. Along the north-south border, Khartoum also used its oil revenues to finance local Arab militias as a front line against the south.", "Sudan's north-south war took a heavy toll on both sides, and in 2005, the government and the SPLM signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA). The CPA enshrined the south's right to self-determination after an \"interim period\" of more than six years, during which the SPLM and the ruling National Congress Party (NCP) formed a unity government. Despite the NCP's stated effort to \"make unity attractive\" to southern Sudanese during the interim period, southerners saw few, if any, benefits from remaining part of Sudan and voted overwhelmingly in a January 2011 referendum to secede. South Sudan achieved independence in July of that year. ", "The CPA failed to resolve several contentious issues, and talks have continued on border disputes and related security issues, debts, and once-shared resources, such as oil. Sudan and South Sudan signed partial deals on security and economic cooperation in 2012, but the full deployment of a joint monitoring mission to ensure the demilitarization of the border has been repeatedly delayed and is limited to sporadic aerial surveillance. The proximity to the border of rebel activity in Sudan's \"new south\" (Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile, and the southern part of Darfur) and the unresolved status of contested areas such as the Abyei region complicates border demilitarization. ", "The border region of Abyei, which was accorded special semi-autonomous status in the CPA, has repeatedly been a flashpoint for violence. The deployment of the U.N. Interim Force for Abyei (UNISFA) defused a violent standoff in 2011 between Sudan and South Sudan, but tensions among local communities still have the potential to destabilize the border and draw the two countries back into direct conflict. Under the CPA, Abyei residents were to vote in a 2011 referendum on whether the area should retain its special status in Sudan or join South Sudan. A dispute about voter eligibility has delayed the process. The Ngok Dinka, who have historically comprised a majority of the area's permanent residents, controversially held their own referendum in 2013, voting to secede from Sudan. Neither Sudan nor the international community has recognized the result. The final status of Abyei is likely to remain unresolved until Sudan and South Sudan negotiate a resolution, possibly as part of a broader deal on outstanding issues between the countries. The United Nations has pressed, unsuccessfully to date, for the establishment of a temporary local administration and police service to maintain order until a final settlement is reached. ", "The armed forces of Sudan and South Sudan have engaged in minor clashes along the border sporadically since separation, most prominently in 2012 when the South Sudanese army briefly occupied the Sudanese oil town of Heglig, purportedly acting in self-defense after an attack on its territory. Sudan bombed one of South Sudan's oil fields in retaliation and further skirmishes ensued. South Sudan periodically accuses Sudan of conducting other air strikes inside its territory. Sudan alleges that South Sudan's ruling party, the SPLM (the former rebel movement), provides support and refuge for Sudanese rebel groups (the likely target of reported air strikes). South Sudan contends that Sudan has, at times, provided weapons and other support for South Sudanese rebel militia, including, most recently, the rebellion known as the SPLM-in Opposition (SPLM-iO), led by South Sudan's former vice president, Riek Machar. In the context of South Sudan's current conflict, there is concern that this alleged proxy support by both sides could spark a wider regional war. Given the mass displacement already caused by the conflicts in the two countries, direct hostilities between the two countries could have devastating humanitarian consequences."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Conflicts in Sudan", "paragraphs": ["The CPA did not resolve Sudan's long-standing center-periphery tensions. Khartoum has continued to respond to the political demands of restive regions more often with force than reform. Its response to an uprising in Darfur in the early 2000s (discussed below) prompted the George W. Bush Administration to declare that Khartoum's \"scorched earth policy\" against the rebels and civilians constituted genocide. More than a decade later, widespread violence still plagues that region. The government's response to a rebellion launched in 2011 in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile (often referred to as \"the Two Areas\") has also drawn international concern. More than two million people have been displaced in the context of that conflict. Unlike in Darfur, where relief agencies are able to operate in most areas, humanitarian access is extremely restricted in those states. ", "As in Darfur, where the Sudanese government has been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity, Khartoum has been accused of grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the Two Areas. It finances local Arab militias, including the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which have been deployed, like the infamous Janjaweed in Darfur, in what the U.N. Panel of Experts on Sudan refers to as a \"proxy war\" against rebel groups. The RSF are widely criticized for indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks against civilians in insurgent areas. The government also continues aerial bombings in Darfur, in violation of U.N. Security Council resolution 1591 (2005), and in the Two Areas, and has been accused of targeting hospitals in Darfur and Southern Kordofan in the past year. ", "According to the U.N. Panel of Experts, which the U.N. Security Council created to monitor an arms embargo in Darfur and a related sanctions regime, the government's strategy \"appears to consist of (a) collective punishment of villages and communities from which the armed opposition groups are believed to come or operate; (b) induced or forced displacement of those communities; and (c) direct engagement, including aerial bombardment, of the groups when their location can be identified.\" The Panel's reporting, which is limited to Darfur, indicates that 3,324 Darfuri villages were destroyed in the five-month period from December 2013 to April 2014, coinciding with a Sudanese military operation led by the RSF known as \"Operation Decisive Summer.\" Independent human rights groups also documented extensive damage to civilian areas in Southern Kordofan in the context of that operation. In December 2014, with the onset of the dry season, referred to in Sudan as \"the fighting season,\" Sudan's defense minister announced the launching of new offensive operations against the rebels in both regions.

Underlying tensions between Darfuri groups over land, water, and grazing rights had driven low-level violence in this arid land for decades, and the central government had historically struggled to govern the region. For years, arms flows by both internal and external actors, including neighboring Libya and Chad, further fueled the violence. Described in 2004 by the State Department as \"the worst humanitarian and human rights crisis in the world,\" what began as a conflict primarily between Arab and non-Arab ethnic groups, namely the Fur, Massalit, and Zaghawa, quickly deteriorated into a civil war characterized by \"widespread and systematic\" rape, torture, killings, forced displacement, and the looting and destruction of hundreds of villages. The crisis drew a massive humanitarian response in the mid-2000s, stemming the casualties, but continuing insecurity in the region has discouraged more than two million displaced persons from returning to their homes. In effect, the conflict created a large semi-urban population with few means of sustaining itself economically. Many of the displaced remain reliant on food aid to survive.", "Fighting in Darfur among ethnic communities, armed groups, and the military has escalated since early 2013, causing displacement on a scale not seen since the first years of the conflict. The 2011 Doha Document for Peace in Darfur (DDPD) has not stopped the violence. By many accounts, the lack of accountability for crimes perpetrated by local groups has generated a sense of impunity in the region. Khartoum's evolving use of local proxies to spur tensions between ethnic communities over land and political power has changed the dynamics of the conflict, and increasing inter-tribal conflicts and fissures within the various armed groups further complicate the path toward a peaceful settlement in the region. Some Arab groups that were previously aligned with the Bashir regime, for example, have recently accused Khartoum of exploiting the Arab tribes in Darfur and declared themselves in opposition to the government's actions. ", "Access by peacekeepers and humanitarian organizations to affected communities in Darfur is limited by both insecurity and government restrictions. Violent criminality in the region has risen, and humanitarian workers have been abducted for ransom. Contestation over land and local natural resources has long been a factor of conflict in the region, and disputes over resources such as gold have fueled further clashes in recent years. Attacks by armed groups against civilians, peacekeepers, and relief workers remain a serious problem\u2014more than 60 peacekeepers have been killed in Darfur since the mission began in 2007. The credibility of the African Union-U.N. Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) has increasingly been questioned amid allegations that it has self-censored its reporting related to state-backed crimes against civilians and peacekeepers. In 2014, when a former UNAMID spokesperson revealed unpublished documents from the mission, a Foreign Policy correspondent wrote:", "UNAMID ... has been reluctant to cast blame on the Sudanese government ... without irrefutable firsthand proof collected by its personnel, an evidentiary standard that has been impossible to achieve. As a result, UNAMID public reporting has often minimized Sudan's violations or withheld strong circumstantial evidence of Khartoum's complicity in, or responsibility for, attacks in UNAMID's reports to the U.N. Security Council.", "Despite ongoing conflict and a humanitarian situation described by U.N. officials as \"dire and very worrisome,\" UNAMID is under pressure from Sudan's government to develop an \"exit strategy.\" President Bashir alleged in late 2014 that \"UNAMID has become a security burden on the Sudanese army more than a supportive [sic] to its forces in the protection of civilians, and unable to protect themselves\" and accuses the force of acting as \"a protector to the rebels.\" While the government subsequently clarified that it did not intend for an immediate exit, negotiations on a strategy are underway. As part of an effort to streamline its personnel and recalibrate its activities toward identified strategic priorities, UNAMID will cut 1,260 of its 4,110 civilian positions in the next two years. Its authorized troop size is already down from almost 20,000 to just below 15,800. The mission is reducing its aviation fleet and has transferred 400 of its vehicles to West Africa for Ebola response. In November 2014, Sudan forced the closure of the mission's human rights office in Khartoum, which the government contends is outside UNAMID's mandate.

One prominent political opposition leader, former Prime Minister Sadiq al Mahdi, who was briefly jailed in mid-2014, has been in exile since signing an August 2014 accord known as the Paris Declaration and a follow-on agreement known as the Sudan Call, under which his Umma party (the largest opposition party) pledged to collaborate politically with the SRF and other opposition groups. Al Mahdi's daughter Meriam, who is deputy head of the party, was briefly detained after the Paris meeting. In the Paris Declaration, the SRF declared its readiness to cease hostilities as a basis for a credible national dialogue.

The agreements are significant in that they bring both armed and unarmed opposition voices together under a common set of political principles.

Security Council, maintains that Sudan's various conflicts require a political, rather than a military solution, has sought to coordinate the various peace processes with the aim of facilitating the eventual participation of all armed and unarmed groups in a national dialogue. In late 2014, the AUHIP convened its first talks between the government and the Darfur armed groups, in Ethiopia (Qatar had previously hosted most of the Darfur negotiations). Those talks, like AUHIP-hosted talks between the SPLM-N and the government in December, were inconclusive. The Sudanese government, meanwhile, seeks to maintain ownership of the National Dialogue process, and President Bashir has resisted proposals by Mbeki to meet under AUHIP auspices with the political parties who have suspended their involvement in the process.

Sudan was seen as a Cold War ally starting in the late 1970s, but after the 1989 coup that brought Bashir and the National Islamic Front to power, the United States downgraded diplomatic relations and cut off aid. The Clinton Administration designated Sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1993, identifying Sudan as a \"rogue state\" and supporting neighboring Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Uganda as \"frontline states\" to contain Khartoum, and to provide support to the southern rebellion. In 1996, under Western pressure, Sudan expelled Osama bin Laden from the country. However, relations between Washington and Khartoum deteriorated further in August 1998, when, in response to the U.S. embassy bombings in East Africa, President Clinton ordered the bombing of a Khartoum pharmaceutical factory purportedly linked to bin Laden. U.S. policy shifted under President George W. Bush to focus on achieving reforms through increased diplomatic engagement. The U.S. Embassy in Khartoum, which had suspended operations in 1996, reopened in 2002. The United States has not appointed an ambassador to Sudan since 1997; a charg\u00e9 d'affaires leads the U.S. embassy, and a special envoy directs policy in Washington. ", "The United States maintains sanctions on Sudan through Executive Orders and congressionally-imposed legal restrictions. Initial sanctions were imposed in 1988, when economic and security assistance was frozen because of Sudan's debt payment arrears to the United States. Congress proposed additional limits on non-humanitarian aid in 1989 to protest government restrictions on aid access in southern Sudan, and by 1990 all non-humanitarian aid was suspended because of the coup. Some sanctions relate to Sudan's state sponsor of terrorism designation, others to abuses committed during the north-south war. Trade sanctions were imposed in 1997. Further sanctions relate specifically to the Darfur conflict, including a prohibition on U.S. transactions in the petroleum and petrochemicals sectors. Under Executive Orders 13067 (1997), 13400 (April 2006), and 13412 (October 2006), Sudanese government assets in the United States are frozen and U.S. transactions with the government or with designated persons involved in the Darfur conflict are prohibited. The FY2015 consolidated appropriations act ( P.L. 113-235 ) prohibits aid to the government or modification of loans held by Sudan.", "Khartoum seeks to improve its relationship with the United States, in part to boost its international standing and its efforts to reengage with multilateral financial institutions. (Of the roughly $45 billion Sudan owes in external sovereign debt, over $2 billion is owed to the United States.) Efforts to normalize relations appeared to have some momentum in 2011, when Sudan was the first country to officially recognize South Sudan. They have since been stymied by several factors, among them the ongoing conflicts in the Two Areas and Darfur. According to U.S. officials, \"the fundamental issue we have in the relationship has to do with the way that the government has treated the people of Sudan, particularly those in the periphery.\" In Khartoum's view, the United States has repeatedly \"moved the goalpost\" on lifting sanctions. The Obama Administration contends that mistrust and miscommunication hinder efforts to improve the bilateral dialogue. To that end, in February 2015 the Administration invited one of President Bashir's top advisors, Ibrahim Ghandour, to Washington for discussions on how to advance \"a more frequent and substantive exchange about our respective interest and concerns in the region, including ways to achieve sustainable peace in Sudan.\" President Obama's Special Envoy for Sudan and South Sudan, Ambassador Donald Booth, who was appointed in 2013, is expected to travel to Sudan for the first time in mid-2015.", "The U.S. Special Envoy has expressed support for the AU effort to facilitate a more cohesive mediation of Sudan's various peace talks and to link those talks to an inclusive national dialogue process. According to Ambassador Booth, \"compartmentalized and regional approaches to peacemaking cannot address grievances and aspirations that are national in character ... dialogue should address fundamental issues of governance, inclusiveness, resource-sharing, identity, and social equality at a national level.\" He has described the conflicts in Darfur and the Two Areas as \"symptoms of a common national ill,\" and referred to the 2011 establishment of the opposition SRF alliance as recognition by disparate groups of \"the national nature of their struggle and of any sustainable solution.\" The Envoy has encouraged Sudan to engage in confidence-building measures to signal good faith as it lays the groundwork for the national dialogue.

These licenses allow certain academic and professional exchanges and authorize the transfer of certain software and services related to personal communications over the Internet.

Per the last report, the Palestinian group Hamas, a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, continues to have a presence and raise funds in Sudan, and elements of Al Qaeda-inspired terrorist groups remain in the country. Sudan's reported role in Iranian arms smuggling to Gaza is another area of concern. In 2013, the State Department named three Sudanese nationals involved in the 2008 murder of two USAID employees in Khartoum as Specially Designated Global Terrorists, subject to sanctions under Executive Order 13224 (2001).

In 1993, the same year that the Clinton Administration designated Sudan as a State Sponsor of Terrorism, the House of Representatives recognized the right of the southern Sudanese to self-determination. By 1999, some Members of Congress who were sympathetic to the cause of the southern insurgents initiated efforts to tighten sanctions. At the same time they pushed to authorize not only food aid but development assistance, including programs to build local administrative capacity, for areas outside of Khartoum's control\u2014namely areas held by the SPLM. In 2002, Congress also appropriated nonlethal assistance for a coalition of armed and unarmed opposition forces (including the SPLM) to \"strengthen its ability to protect civilians from attacks.\" At the same time, Congress expressed support for Bush Administration efforts to seek a negotiated settlement to end Sudan's north-south civil war. ", "In 2003, conflict and human rights abuses in Darfur captured international attention and galvanized a campaign that led Congress and President Bush to accuse Khartoum of genocide and further tighten sanctions. Congress added Darfur to the areas outside government control eligible to receive U.S. foreign aid and required the President to develop a contingency plan for delivering relief aid to any areas where the government denied access. In 2006, after the north-south war had ended, Congress enacted additional economic and diplomatic sanctions against Khartoum to press for a resolution of the Darfur conflict. It also authorized assistance to implement the north-south agreement, including military aid to support the SPLA's transformation from a guerilla movement into a professional army.

Balancing these objectives has occasionally placed Congress and the Executive Branch at odds. Ending the human suffering and related human rights violations associated with Sudan's distinct but overlapping conflicts has been the overarching goal of U.S. policymakers for more than two decades. With finite attention and resources, however, U.S. policy toward Sudan has, at times, appeared to prioritize resolving one conflict at the expense of another. Negotiating humanitarian access to communities affected by the conflicts has required compromise, and that compromise has sometimes appeared to moderate calls for a more confrontational approach toward Bashir's regime. Similarly, U.S. pursuit of counterterrorism objectives in the broader region has led successive Administrations to seek dialogue and cooperation from Khartoum. Facilitating peaceful relations between Sudan and South Sudan has also complicated U.S. engagement with regard to ongoing conflicts in the two countries.", "Peace and stability in Sudan remains among the highest of U.S. foreign policy priorities in Africa, yet this goal remains elusive. Critics of Sudanese peace negotiations suggest that piecemeal approaches to Sudan's overlapping conflicts have prolonged the country's seemingly chronic instability. In recent years, the United States has increasingly called for a comprehensive agreement that promotes democratic reform and \"lasting peace throughout all of Sudan.\" African Union mediators have expressed a similar sentiment since 2013, recommending that possible solutions for both the Darfur and Two Areas conflicts \"be explored in the context of national democratization and constitutional reform in Sudan.\" Khartoum has long resisted efforts to combine discussions with various opponents to the regime, preferring to negotiate separately with the SPLM and the SPLM-N, the Darfur groups, and others. This approach has yielded some positive outcomes, but it has also resulted in partially implemented agreements that do not fully address regional grievances or resolve disputes that are fundamentally national issues. Government rhetoric about a national dialogue may hold some promise, but deteriorating security conditions in Darfur, ongoing conflict in the Two Areas, and continued violations of basic rights and freedoms across the country have not engendered trust among Khartoum's critics.", "The United States faces a complex range of policy options as it considers the way forward for engagement with Sudan. Members of Congress may debate whether they concur with the Administration's current approach or wish to guide U.S. policy in a different direction. Previous congressional action on Sudan may provide lessons and examples. Advocates and experts may have new ideas on the merits of various \"carrots\" and \"sticks,\" or other policy options to promote peace and stability and discourage serious human rights abuses in the country. While annual aid appropriations measures continue to include provisions restricting U.S. aid to the government of Sudan, Congress has not passed standalone Sudan legislation since 2007 (prior to the outbreak of the conflict in the Two Areas). During the 113 th Congress, the House of Representatives considered, but did not pass, new punitive measures on Sudan under H.R. 1692 , the Sudan Peace, Security, and Accountability Act of 2013. The 114 th Congress may consider similar legislation, or explore other legislative or oversight efforts to influence the direction of U.S. engagement. "], "subsections": []}]}}
