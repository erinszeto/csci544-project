Since then, questions and concerns about conservation program funding, policy objectives, individual program effectiveness, comparative geographic emphasis, and the structure of federal assistance have been recurring issues in the debate shaping each successive omnibus farm bill. The 2008 farm bill is no exception. These long-standing issues arguably became even more apparent in this farm bill as they found their way into many individual program changes. This result may be a continuation of the more active profile taken by many conservation groups and their supporters in the 2002 farm bill. Unlike commodity programs, conservation program participation tends to be well represented by small and mid-size farming operations, according to the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Economic Research Service. The programs also enjoy wider public support. In an environment of pronounced domestic budget constraint, however, conservation groups and producers found themselves competing with other farming interests for the necessary resources to expand and continue many conservation programs. Budget concerns aside, several other issues emerged in the debate leading to enactment of the 2008 farm bill: funding priorities and payment structure, geographic targeting, program complexity, the importance of large-scale conservation efforts, and measurement of costs and effectiveness. These general policy issues\u2014in various forms\u2014raised questions central to the deliberations and outcomes in the enacted conservation title of the farm bill."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Program Funding and Producer Payment Limits", "paragraphs": ["Among the questions raised were: Should payment limits be program-specific, or for some combination of conservation programs? Would the imposition of payment limits change patterns of participation and effectiveness of conservation programs? What are the potential differences in saving under different payment limit options? Where should savings be allocated? Should each conservation program have the same payment limit? How will funding levels affect the existing backlog of interest in program participation that cannot be met?"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Geographic Emphasis", "paragraphs": ["Because agricultural production is concentrated in specific regions of the United States, agricultural conservation and environmental issues are not randomly distributed. Some areas and some natural resources reveal greater environmental impact from agricultural activities\u2014actual and potential\u2014than others. For example, pressures on farmland development from urban sprawl are more pronounced on the East and West Coasts. Although many areas of the United States have water quality/quantity concerns or air quality issues, the deterioration of certain watersheds and certain air sheds is more advanced in some places than in others. How is it determined where federal conservation spending would be most effective? Should certain locations (states, regions, or watersheds) be targeted? Does targeting particular producer groups provide an effective strategy in resource management? Should some types of agricultural production or resource concerns receive higher priority in evaluating applications?"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Complexity", "paragraphs": ["Members of Congress, conservation groups, the Administration, and individual producers raised questions about the desirability of proliferating conservation programs and the complexity of adhering to various regulations that govern the programs. Some producers might have some acreage under one program and other acreage under another program. On-farm wetland management may be regulated by one program, while the environmental management plan of retired acreage is under another program.

A significant question raised by conservation groups, however, is the extent to which conservation efforts would be more effective and more efficient if they took place at larger scales, for example, through regional or multistate resource planning and multistate conservation planning. Because the conservation programs are voluntary, concern was voiced that participation could decline if producers felt that conservation programs were more remote from local planning input. Using watersheds or river basin drainage areas as policy targets, for example, could reduce the planning control of any single area jurisdiction. The trade-off is seen in the efficiencies that potentially stem from pooling financial and planning resources and targeting particular resource issues affecting most if not all producers. The Chesapeake Bay region, the Great Lakes, and specific river basins with significant agricultural impacts are examples where larger scale planning may hold particular advantages."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["How effective are federal conservation programs in improving environmental management of natural resources? Evaluation is an essential part of effective conservation management. Yet, developing practical and reliable indicators that can be used across programs and with different producers and different resources has been a challenge. Policymakers and stakeholders generally agree that conservation measures have been effective in reducing the environmental impact of agricultural activities, but at what cost, in what locations, and under what specific circumstances are much more difficult questions to answer. The recognized importance of establishing valid indicators has been an ongoing issue in environmental management.

The various conservation programs administered by USDA can be broadly grouped into land retirement and easement programs and so-called \"working lands\" programs. In general, land retirement and easement programs take land out of crop production and provide for program rental payments and cost-sharing to establish longer term conservation coverage, in order to convert the land back into forests, grasslands, or wetlands. Working lands programs provide technical and financial assistance to assist agricultural producers in improving natural resource conservation and management practices on their productive lands. The enacted 2008 farm bill also creates several new conservation programs under the bill's conservation and other titles. The following sections provide brief overviews of the Title II changes to agricultural conservation programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Land Retirement and Easement Programs", "paragraphs": ["Major land retirement and easement programs include the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP), the Grasslands Reserve Program (GRP), the Farmland Protection Program (FPP), among other programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Conservation Reserve Program", "paragraphs": ["The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is a voluntary program that allows producers to enter into 10-15 year contracts that provide annual rental payments and financial assistance to install certain conservation practices and maintain vegetative or tree covers. Its purpose is to conserve and improve soil, water, and wildlife resources by converting highly erodible and other environmentally sensitive acreage to a long-term vegetative cover. CRP is the largest conservation program in terms of total annual funding. It is administered by USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) and is funded through the Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). CRP also has several subprograms, one of which is the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), that are designated to support state and federal partnerships through incentive payments for installing specific conservation practices that help protect environmentally sensitive land, decrease erosion, restore wildlife habitat, and safeguard ground and surface water.", "The enacted 2008 farm bill (Secs. 2101-2111) caps CRP enrollment at 32 million acres, down from its current cap of 39.2 million acres. The managers report on the conference agreement states this reduction is \"not ... an indicator of declining or reduced support for CRP\"; however, in other sections of the report USDA is encouraged to assist producers who are transitioning from land retirement to working lands conservation. The farm bill makes certain program changes, including allowing USDA to address state, regional, and national conservation initiatives; providing incentives for beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers/ranchers to purchase CRP land from retiring farmers; allowing certain types of managed haying and grazing and installation of wind turbines on enrolled lands (but at reduced rental rates); requiring that program participants manage lands according to a conservation plan; requiring USDA to survey annually the per-acre estimates of county cash rents paid to CRP contract holders; clarifying the status of alfalfa grown as part of a rotation practice; and establishing cost-sharing rates for certain types of conservation structures.", "The bill also amends the pilot program for wetland and buffer acres in CRP. Each state can enroll up to 100,000 acres up to a national maximum of one million acres. This maximum may be raised to 200,000 in each state following a review of the program. Eligible lands for the program include (1) wetlands that have been cropped three of the immediately preceding 10 crop years; (2) land on which a constructed wetland is to be developed to manage fertilizer runoff; and (3) land that has been devoted to commercial pond-raised aquaculture.", "Conditions under which managed haying and grazing on CRP acreage may occur have been modified. The farm bill allows managed harvesting and grazing in response to drought and routine grazing to control invasive species. Where routine harvesting is permitted, state technical committees are required to coordinate to ensure appropriate environmental management. In addition to managed harvesting, the installation of wind turbines on enrolled land is now permitted activity. Any of these permitted uses on CRP acreage will result in a rental payment reduction commensurate with the economic value of the authorized activity.", "The enacted farm bill permits 50% cost share payments on land used for hardwood trees, windbreaks, shelterbelts, and wildlife corridors for contracts entered into after November 1990. Contracts extend from a minimum of two years up to four years. Funding of $100 million also is authorized to cover cost sharing for the thinning of trees to improve the management of natural resources on the land.", "The 2008 farm bill modifies the criteria for evaluating CRP contract applications. Evaluation criteria include the extent to which a CRP contract application would improve soil resources, water quality, or wildlife habitat. The bill also allows the Secretary to establish different criteria in various states or regions that lead to improvements in soil quality or wildlife habitat. Preference in new CRP contracts will be given to land owners and operators who are residents of the county or a contiguous county in which the land is located.", "The farm bill also establishes incentives to increase the participation of beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers. It authorizes CRP contract modifications to assist these producers in leasing or purchasing land under a CRP contract from a retired or retiring farm owner or operator. The provision authorizes $25 million for assistance in making these land transfers.", "Other enacted modifications to CRP include redefining the Chesapeake Bay region as a priority area without limiting the region to the states of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia.
