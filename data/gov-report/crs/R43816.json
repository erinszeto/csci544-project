Current President Mauricio Macri\u2014the leader of the center-right Republican Proposal and the candidate of the Let's Change coalition representing center-right and center-left parties\u2014won the 2015 presidential race. He succeeded two-term President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, from the center-left faction of the Peronist party known as the Front for Victory, who in turn had succeeded her husband, N\u00e9stor Kirchner, in 2007. Macri's election ended the Kirchners' 12-year rule, which helped Argentina emerge from a severe economic crisis in 2001-2002 but also was characterized by protectionist and unorthodox economic policies.", "President Macri has moved swiftly since his December 2015 inauguration to usher in changes to the government's economic, foreign, and other policies. Among its economic policy changes, the Macri government lifted currency controls; eliminated or reduced taxes on agricultural exports; and reduced electricity, water, and heating gas subsidies. The government also reached a deal with remaining private creditors in 2016 that ended the country's 15-year default, an action that allowed the government to repair its \"rogue\" debtor status and to resume borrowing in international capital markets. Although economic adjustment measures resulted in a 2.3% economic contraction in 2016, the economy is forecast to grow by 2.2% in 2017. In the foreign policy arena, the Macri government has improved relations with neighboring Brazil and Uruguay and with the promarket countries of the Pacific Alliance. Forthcoming legislative elections in October 2017 can be seen as a referendum on Macri's policies.", "U.S. Relations", "U.S.-Argentine relations generally have been characterized by robust commercial relations and cooperation in such issues as nonproliferation, human rights, education, and science and technology. Under the Kirchner governments, however, there were periodic tensions in relations. Macri's election brought to power a government that has demonstrated a commitment to improved relations with the United States.", "The Obama Administration moved swiftly to engage the Macri government on a range of bilateral, regional, and global issues. Demonstrating the change in relations, President Obama traveled to Argentina in March 2016 for a state visit that increased cooperation in such areas as trade and investment, renewable energy, climate change, and citizen security. In August 2016, then-Secretary of State John Kerry launched a High-Level Dialogue with Argentina to serve as a mechanism to ensure sustained engagement.", "Strong bilateral relations are continuing under the Trump Administration. President Macri visited the White House on April 27, 2017, with the two leaders discussing ways to deepen relations in such areas as trade and investment, combatting illicit trafficking and financing, cyber policy, and the situation in Venezuela. On trade issues, U.S. officials have raised concerns for a number of years about Argentina's enforcement of intellectual property rights protection and various restrictions on imports; Argentina is interested in the restoration of U.S. trade preferences under the Generalized System of Preferences, which were suspended in 2012, as well as in access to the U.S. market for fresh beef and lemons.", "U.S.-Argentine relations largely have been an oversight issue for Congress, but in the aftermath of Macri's election in 2015 key Members of Congress urged the Obama Administration to prioritize relations with Argentina. In the 115th Congress, the House passed H.Res. 54 (Sires) on April 3, 2017, which, among other provisions, upholds commitment to the bilateral partnership between the United States and Argentina. On June 5, 2017, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations reported a similar but not identical resolution, S.Res. 18 (Coons), as amended. Another congressional interest has been Argentina's progress in investigating two terrorist bombings in Buenos Aires\u2014the 1992 bombing of the Israeli embassy and the 1994 bombing of the Argentine-Israeli Mutual Association (AMIA)\u2014as well as the 2015 death of the AMIA special prosecutor.

The military's so-called Dirty War against leftists and their sympathizers in the late 1970s and early 1980s had resulted in thousands of disappearances. The military ultimately fell into disrepute in the aftermath of its failure in the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) war with Great Britain in 1982, and the country returned to civilian democratic rule with the election of Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn of the Radical Civic Union (UCR) as president in 1983. Carlos Menem of the Justicialist Party (PJ), also known as the Peronist Party, won the 1989 elections and served two presidential terms until 1999, during which he transformed Argentina from having a state-dominated protectionist economy to one committed to free market principles and open to trade. Increasing corruption and high unemployment, however, led to the defeat of the Peronists in the 1999 presidential election, which was won by Fernando de la R\u00faa of the UCR as the candidate of a coalition known as the Alliance for Work, Justice, and Education.", "In 2001-2002, Argentina's democratic political system endured considerable stress amid a severe economic crisis and related social unrest. In late 2001, as the banking system faltered and confidence in the government of President de la R\u00faa evaporated, widespread demonstrations turned violent, and the president resigned. The subsequent interim government then defaulted on nearly $100 billion in public debt, the largest sovereign default in history at the time. Ultimately, the political system survived the crisis. President Eduardo Duhalde (January 2002-May 2003), a Peronist (Justicialist Party, PJ) senator selected by Congress to fill out the remainder of President de la R\u00faa's term, implemented policies that stabilized the economy; then, left-leaning President N\u00e9stor Kirchner (May 2003-December 2007), a Peronist who had served as a provincial governor of Santa Cruz in Patagonia, further enhanced internal political and economic stability.", "Despite some difficulties, Kirchner made popular policy moves in the areas of human rights and economic policy that helped restore Argentines' faith in democracy. In June 2005, the government offered the first of two restructurings of its defaulted private bond debt with a historically low recovery rate to bondholders (about 30% on a net present value basis). While this was politically popular in Argentina, the government's failure to repay its arrears to official Paris Club creditors or to reach a deal with remaining private creditors in defaulted bond debt who did not accept the government's offer continued to prevent Argentina from having full access to international capital markets. Legislative elections in 2005 demonstrated strong support for Kirchner; his left-leaning wing of the PJ, known as the Front for Victory (FPV), made significant gains. Kirchner would have been eligible to run again in the 2007 presidential elections, but instead he supported the candidacy of his wife, Senator Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner (hereinafter Fern\u00e1ndez).", "Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez completed her second term as president in December 2015. She had won her first term in 2007 with 45% of the vote, defeating her closest rival by 23 points, and became the first woman in Argentine history to be elected president. In concurrent legislative elections, Fern\u00e1ndez's FPV faction of the PJ gained further seats, solidifying its majority in both houses of Argentina's bicameral Congress. Nevertheless, Fern\u00e1ndez's political honeymoon was short-lived because of an energy crisis and a series of farmers' strikes that led to the congressional defeat of her proposed tax increase on key agricultural exports. As a result, the Kirchners suffered a significant setback in the 2009 legislative elections, with the FPV losing control of both houses. It appeared that former President Kirchner was poised to run again for the presidency in 2011, but his death from a heart attack changed the political landscape. Instead, Fern\u00e1ndez ran for reelection and won a second mandate in October 2011 with 54% of the vote, the largest percentage in a presidential race since the country's return to democratic rule. Her support was buoyed by an outpouring of sympathy after the death of her husband as well as by the absence of a strong opposition candidate. The president's FPV also regained a legislative majority in both houses of Congress.", "President Fern\u00e1ndez's popularity, however, fell considerably after her reelection amid large-scale public protests against corruption, increasing crime, the government's economic policies, and the government's efforts to exert influence over the media and the judiciary. In Argentina's October 2013 legislative elections, in which one-half of the Chamber of Deputies and one-third of the Senate were at stake, President Fern\u00e1ndez's Front for Victory managed to retain control of both houses. The FPV and its allies gained several seats in the 257-seat Chamber of Deputies, and in the 72-member Senate, the FPV lost several seats but retained a majority. Nevertheless, the FPV was unable to secure the two-thirds majorities needed to approve a constitutional reform that would have allowed President Fern\u00e1ndez to run for a third consecutive term in 2015. ", "In 2014, despite her lame-duck status, President Fern\u00e1ndez still achieved congressional approval for initiatives to regulate the oil sector, reform telecommunications, and revise the civil and criminal codes. Her government also did an about-face by resolving long-standing arbitral disputes with foreign companies and finalizing an agreement to pay foreign government creditors. However, the Fern\u00e1ndez government's impasse with private creditors who did not participate in the government's debt restructurings in 2005 and 2010\u2014the so-called \"holdouts\"\u2014intensified in 2014 because of U.S. court rulings that made it difficult for Argentina to make payments on its restructured debt unless it also paid the holdouts (see \" Debt Issues \" below).", "In the first half of 2015, the Fern\u00e1ndez government was grappling with the fallout from the death of Alberto Nisman, the special prosecutor who, for the last decade, had been investigating the 1994 bombing of the Argentine-Israeli Mutual Association (AMIA) in which 85 people were killed. In January 2015, Nisman was found dead from a gunshot wound just a day before he was to testify before Argentina's Congress regarding explosive accusations that President Fern\u00e1ndez and other government officials attempted to whitewash the AMIA investigation in efforts to improve relations with Iran. After Nisman's death, an Argentine prosecutor took up Nisman's case against President Fern\u00e1ndez related to Iran, but it was ultimately dismissed in April 2015. In the aftermath of Nisman's allegations, President Fern\u00e1ndez's popularity fell to under 30%, but it subsequently increased in the second half of the year to 50%.

Macri defeated Daniel Scioli, the candidate of the FPV, the leftist Peronist party faction of President Fern\u00e1ndez. In a close race, Macri, the mayor of Buenos Aires, took 51.4% of the vote compared to 48.6% for Scioli, the outgoing governor of Buenos Aires province. ", "Macri is the leader of the center-right Republican Proposal (PRO) party and was completing his second term as mayor. He has a business background and also served as president of one of Argentina's most popular football clubs, Boca Juniors. One difficulty for Macri's candidacy was that his Buenos Aires-centered political party was thought not to have a nationwide reach. During the August 2015 primary campaign, Macri moved more to the center so as not to alienate those Argentines supportive of the government's social programs. As part of an attempt to expand his base, Macri supported protests by farm groups who oppose the government's imposition of export taxes. He emphasized unity among the PRO and two other parties of the Let's Change coalition\u2014the center-left Radical Civic Union (UCR) and the center-left Civic Coalition.", "Scioli had won the first presidential round held on October 25, with 37.1% of the vote, compared to 34.2% for Macri, and 21.4% for Sergio Massa, a deputy in Argentina's Congress who headed a centrist dissident Peronist faction known as United for a New Alternative (UNA). A second round was required between Scioli and Macri since no candidate received 45% of the vote or 40% of the vote with a 10-point lead. Macri's strong performance in the first round, between 5% and 8% higher than predicted, gave him significant momentum going into the second round. A key factor in the second round was whether Macri would be able to capture the votes of moderate Peronists who had supported Sergio Massa. ", "Scioli was a close ally of President Kirchner, serving as his vice president from 2003 to 2007. Going into the presidential race, Scioli reportedly was not close to President Fern\u00e1ndez, but ultimately received her endorsement. Some observers contend that Scioli was burdened by being tied to the Kirchners and in particular, the polemic figure of President Fern\u00e1ndez. According to press reports, a growing number of Argentines had become fatigued by her strong governing style and reports of corruption by her prominent supporters. ", "Some observers described Macri's victory as a political upheaval in Argentina that constituted a rebuke for Kirchnerismo, although the close presidential race (with less than 3% separating Macri and Scioli) also reflected a deeply divided electorate. Moreover, although Macri's non-Peronist electoral coalition won the presidency, it won only a minority of seats in Congress. Argentines also voted in legislative elections in October 2015 for one-half of the Chamber of Deputies and one-third of the Senate. The FPV\u2014the leftist Peronist faction of former President Fern\u00e1ndez\u2014retained the largest bloc of seats in the lower house and a majority in the Senate.

His election ended the 12-year run of Kirchnerismo that helped Argentina emerge from a severe economic crisis in 2001-2002 but also was characterized by protectionist and unorthodox economic policies and at times difficult relations with the United States.", "In the aftermath of Macri's electoral victory, some observers believed that the new president would face difficulty moving forward with some of his policy changes, given that his party and other parties in the Let's Change coalition have only a minority of seats in Congress. To date, however, President Macri largely has received backing from Argentina's Congress for key elements of his legislative agenda despite the minority status of his coalition in the legislature. Sergio Massa pledged that his centrist Peronist bloc (now known as United for a New Argentina, or UNA) would support Macri, although Massa maintained that he would not give the president a blank check. The FPV, the leftist Peronist bloc, has faced a number of defections from its ranks as it has confronted high-profile corruption scandals associated with the Fern\u00e1ndez government. Former President Fern\u00e1ndez herself is facing various corruption-related charges, including those involving a family real estate company and a public works project. On June 14, 2017, Fern\u00e1ndez announced the establishment of a new political party, Citizens' Unity, that would present candidates in the October 2017 mid-term legislative elections, although it is unclear if she will be a candidate (see \" October 2017 Legislative Elections ,\" below).", "Economic Policy Changes. Among its various economic policy changes, the Macri government lifted currency controls within the president's first week in office, which caused a rapid devaluation of the Argentine peso by some 30%. The action was taken to contend with capital flight and generate needed foreign investment. Currency controls had first been implemented by the Fern\u00e1ndez government in 2011 to avoid depreciation of the peso. The Macri government also moved to eliminate taxes on most agricultural exports, with the exception of soybeans (Argentina's largest export), for which export taxes were lowered from 35% to 30% and are to be lowered each year by 5% until their elimination. Export taxes had first been imposed in 2002 and were used by the Kirchner and Fern\u00e1ndez governments to boost government revenue for social programs, but the policy resulted in a decline in agricultural production and hoarding by some producers. The Macri government also moved forward to eliminate subsidies on electricity, water, and heating gas, actions that have been lauded by the IMF but, not surprisingly, have been politically unpopular.", "The Macri government overhauled the leadership and staff of the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INDEC) that for many years the IMF and economists criticized for producing inaccurate inflation and other economic data. The government suspended publication of inflation statistics until INDEC began publishing new data in June 2016. An IMF technical mission to Argentina reported in July 2016 that it was impressed with the Argentine authorities' strong commitment to improving the quality and transparency of official data, a contrast to the IMF's stance toward the Fern\u00e1ndez government, which it criticized for publishing unreliable data. ", "During the electoral campaign, Macri vowed to resolve the long-standing dispute with remaining private or holdout creditors (approximately $15 billion, with principal and past-due interest) who did not participate in previous debt restructurings in 2005 and 2010. His new government held its first formal meeting with holdout creditors in January 2016, and reached agreements with the major holdouts in February. By the end of March 2016, both houses of Argentina's Congress had approved the deal by large margins, essentially resolving a thorny issue that had effectively kept Argentina out of international financial markets. With the issue resolved, Argentina returned to international capital markets in April 2016 with a $16.5 billion bond offer (see \" Debt Issues ,\" below).", "Efforts to Combat Organized Crime. In other domestic policy moves, President Macri has taken a series of measures to combat organized crime, particularly drug trafficking, which he maintains was ignored by the previous government. In January 2016, he issued a decree declaring a one-year national security emergency to combat drug trafficking. The decree calls for the immediate deployment of additional federal security at Argentina's borders and the establishment of a new radar system, and it provides authority to the armed forces to shoot down aircraft suspected of drug trafficking. In February 2016, President Macri decreed the establishment of a new drug agency to prevent illicit trafficking, provide technical assistance in related court cases, and oversee the use and control of chemical ingredients and substances that could be used to make drugs. In January 2017, as part of his anticrime agenda, President Macri signed a decree to expedite the deportation of foreign residents who commit crimes and to prohibit the entrance of migrants with prior convictions, a move that some critics dubbed as xenophobic.", "Foreign Policy . In the foreign policy arena, the Macri government has moved to improve relations with Brazil, Uruguay, the United States, and the promarket countries of the Pacific Alliance\u2014Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. Macri has been strongly critical of the Venezuelan government's repression of its political opponents, demonstrating a sharp departure from the Fern\u00e1ndez government's close relations with Venezuela. The Macri government has been supportive of the actions of Organization of American States (OAS) Secretary General Luis Almagro to invoke the Inter-American Democratic Charter on Venezuela because of the setback to democracy in that country. In December 2016, Argentina joined Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay in suspending Venezuela's participation in Mercosur (Common Market of the South) because of its failure to adhere to the group's membership requirements. With regard to Iran, President Macri announced soon after his election that his government would not appeal a 2014 Argentine court ruling that declared unconstitutional a 2013 agreement with Iran that had been negotiated by the Fern\u00e1ndez government to jointly investigate the 1994 AMIA bombing (see \" AMIA Investigation and Death of Alberto Nisman ,\" below).", "The Macri government also has moved to strengthen relations with the United Kingdom (UK). Following bilateral meetings, the two countries issued a joint communiqu\u00e9 in September 2016 outlining areas of discussion that took place, including agreement to reactivate annual high-level bilateral consultations addressing global challenges and to set up a dialogue to improve cooperation on \"South Atlantic\" issues. ", "The South Atlantic issues noted in the communiqu\u00e9 relate to the Falkland (Malvinas) Islands, a British Overseas Territory that Argentina has long claimed sovereignty over; in a 1982 war, Argentina's military occupied the islands until a British naval task force retook them. In the 2016 joint communiqu\u00e9, Argentina and the UK maintained that the formula on sovereignty regarding the islands reached in 1989 (which essentially recognized the sovereignty dispute and each country's position) applied. Both governments also agreed to take appropriate measures to remove obstacles that limit the economic growth and sustainable development of the islands\u2014including in trade, fishing, shipping, and hydrocarbons\u2014and to establish further air links between the islands and third countries. In addition, both countries expressed full support for a DNA identification process for the unknown Argentine soldiers buried in a cemetery on the islands. Although little advancement has taken place on most of these issues, there has been progress on the soldier-identification process. A framework agreement was reached in December 2016 in which the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is heading up a forensic specialist team, with Argentine participation; exhumation work is expected to begin in June 2017. ", "President Macri visited China in May 2017 to attend China's \"One Belt, One Road\" summit, in which Chinese officials presented plans for infrastructure projects worldwide. The trip reportedly led to agreements for more than $16 billion in Chinese investments in Argentina, including projects in agriculture, transportation, mining, and energy (including two nuclear power plants).

In March and April 2017, protests increased related to the government's economic austerity program, but the government has resisted pressure to backtrack on the reform process. The protests included a strike by teachers calling for wage increases and a general strike organized by the largely Peronist General Labor Confederation in early April 2017 that, according to some reports, received only lukewarm public support. Moreover, the strength of pro-Macri demonstrations across the country on April 1, 2017, reportedly surprised many observers. President Macri's public approval ratings reportedly showed a downward trend in March 2017, but by April polls showed that he had regained support. One poll showed that Macri's popularity increased 6 points to 53% in April 2017. ", "Some observers contend that President Macri's Let's Change coalition likely will continue to have minority representation in the aftermath of the October elections given that Peronists have a strong presence nationwide. Nevertheless, an increase of seats by the president's coalition, including his PRO party, could demonstrate support for the government and could augur well for Macri as a candidate in the October 2019 presidential election.", "On June 14, 2017, former President Fern\u00e1ndez, the leader of the leftist FPV faction of the Peronist or Justicialist Party (PJ), announced the launch of a new Citizen's Unity ( Unidad Ciudadana ) party, which will put forward its own candidates in the legislative elections separate from the PJ. The formation of the new party appears to be a definitive split within the Peronist party. Some observers view Fern\u00e1ndez's move as a major political gamble that could diminish the PJ as a political force in the country. It is unclear if Fern\u00e1ndez will run for a legislative seat, but observers believe the party could be a vehicle for her to launch a presidential bid in 2019. An open primary for all political parties is scheduled to be held on August 13, 2017, with parties currently in the midst of choosing candidates. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Human Rights Issues", "paragraphs": ["Prosecutions of Military-Era Human Rights Violations . For more than a decade, Argentine governments have made significant efforts to bring to justice those responsible for the killing of thousands of people (up to some 30,000, according to Argentine human rights groups, although others claim a lower number) and the torture of thousands during the so-called Dirty War, which occurred under military rule from 1976 to 1983. Since the Argentine Supreme Court overturned amnesty laws in 2003, more than 700 people, including many former military and police officials, have been convicted for the atrocities committed under military rule. These have included former military rulers General Jorge Rafael Videla (1976-1981), who died in prison in 2013, and General Reynaldo Bignone (1982-1983), who remains in prison. ", "In May 2016, Bignone (already convicted previously for human rights abuses) was convicted along with 14 other military officers (including one from Uruguay) for their roles in Operation Condor, a plan among several South American military governments in the 1970s and 1980s targeting regime opponents through kidnappings, torture, and killings. In August 2016, 38 former military officers were convicted (with 28 sentenced to life in prison) for their roles in the killing of several hundred victims in torture centers during the military dictatorship. Argentine judicial authorities continue to investigate and prosecute other cases of individuals implicated in human rights abuses committed during the Dirty War. More than 120 children taken from their imprisoned parents were identified as of November 2016, according to Human Rights Watch. ", "During his March 2016 visit to Argentina, President Obama announced a decision to identify and declassify additional U.S. documents from the era of military rule. Thousands of State Department documents already had been declassified in 2002. (For more information, see \" Bilateral Relations Under the Macri Administration ,\" below.)", "In early May 2017, Argentina's Supreme Court issued a decision to apply a sentencing calculation using the \"two for one\" law (by which each day in prison counts for two days) to effectively reduce the sentence of Luis Mui\u00f1a, who was sentenced in 2011 to 13 years in prison for kidnapping and torture during the military dictatorship, making him eligible for release in November 2017. In doing so, the court expanded the use of this sentencing calculation to include crimes against humanity. The court decision prompted public outrage, with tens of thousands of Argentines protesting the court's action for fear that it could lead to the commutation of sentences of hundreds of people convicted for crimes during the period of military rule. Political parties across the spectrum and President Macri opposed the Supreme Court's action. Argentina's Congress subsequently moved quickly to pass a bill prohibiting the \"two for one\" rule from being applied in cases of crimes against humanity.", "Press Freedom. Some human rights groups had criticized the Fern\u00e1ndez government regarding press freedom. Press rights groups criticized the government for punishing media outlets critical of the government by withholding public advertising and instead awarding such advertising to outlets close to the government. In August 2016, the Macri government took action to establish criteria for the use of advertising funds. The State Department's 2016 human rights report for Argentina stated that some Argentine media that had benefitted from a large amount of public advertising money under the Fern\u00e1ndez government had shut down or were facing serious economic problems.", "The Fern\u00e1ndez government also had battled with the Clar\u00edn media group, which owns Argentina's most widely read newspaper, as well as radio stations, broadcast and cable television outlets, and an Internet service provider. In 2009, the government enacted a controversial law regulating broadcast and print media that it indicated was designed to strengthen pluralism and information freedom. The government maintained that it wanted Clar\u00edn to sell some of its assets in order to create more competition in the media market, while some press rights groups contended that the government actually wanted to muzzle Clar\u00edn, which has often been critical of the government. In October 2013, Argentina's Supreme Court upheld key provisions of the law. Clar\u00edn subsequently presented a plan to the government to break up its holdings into six different companies. An outline of the plan initially had been approved by the government's regulatory agency, the Federal Audiovisual Communications Authority (AFSCA) in February 2014, but in October 2014, the board of directors of AFSCA voted against Clar\u00edn's plan and said that the agency itself would undertake enforcement of the media law and the breakup of the media group. The president of the AFSCA said that Clar\u00edn's plan would have maintained linkages among the new companies and violated the spirit of the media law. Clar\u00edn maintained that the government was attempting to stifle dissent and appropriate private property.", "President Macri issued a decree in late December 2015 that significantly amended the 2009 media law. The decree abolished the AFSCA and another regulatory body that had been set up to oversee telecommunications, the Federal Authority for Information Technology and Communications, and replaced both of them with a new entity, the National Communications Entity. The Macri government and some press rights groups maintained that the regulatory process had become politicized under the Fern\u00e1ndez government. Some protests against the Macri government's changes to the media law took place in January 2016, with critics arguing that the government's action removed limits to media concentration and therefore jeopardizes freedom of expression."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.S.-Argentine Relations", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In the aftermath of Argentina's return to democracy in 1983, the United States and Argentina developed strong relations, which were especially close during the presidency of Carlos Menem (1989-1999).

The tough U.S. approach toward Argentina during its political and financial crisis in 2001-2002, in which the United States supported the cutoff of assistance from the IMF until Argentina committed to a sustainable economic plan, caused friction. ", "Tensions in bilateral relations increased in 2011 because of two incidents that occurred in the aftermath of a White House decision to exclude a visit to Argentina on President Obama's first trip to South America.

Although the terms were widely viewed as unfavorable for the bondholders, more than 90% of bondholders agreed to participate in the exchanges.

In 2014, Argentina estimated that the claims totaled approximately $15 billion, including principal and past-due interest. Most of the holdouts are hedge funds that bought the bonds in secondary markets at steep discounts after the default. The holdouts have pursued litigation to seek full repayment from Argentina, primarily in the United States, since a large proportion of Argentine bonds were issued under New York law. ", "Although the legal cases have examined a number of issues, the most consequential ruling relates to the interpretation of a clause in the bond contracts that dictates creditors be treated equally: the pari passu clause. A smaller group of the holdout creditors, with claims totaling $1.3 billion, argued that paying the exchange bondholders while repudiating the holdout bonds is a breach of this provision. In 2012, a New York federal district court judge, Thomas Griesa, ruled in favor of the holdouts. As a result, if Argentina did not pay the group of litigating holdouts, U.S. financial institutions legally could no longer transfer interest payments from Argentina to the exchange bondholders. In effect, for Argentina to pay the exchange bondholders, it would have to pay the holdouts as well. The ruling was appealed, eventually reaching the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court announced in June 2014 that it would not hear the case, letting the previous ruling stand. ", "Following the Supreme Court announcement, the Argentine government faced a difficult decision. It could either (a) pay the holdouts and the exchange bondholders or (b) pay neither group and default on the exchange bonds debt. Paying the holdouts would have been financially and politically costly, requiring a sizeable portion of Argentina's foreign exchange reserves, and could have been seen as the Argentine government \"caving\" to foreign investors. Even though the Argentine government transferred funds to pay the holders of the restructured bonds, intermediary banks were not legally able to process the payments. In 2014, credit rating agencies declared Argentina to be in default, for the eighth time in the country's history. Some analysts argued that the Fernandez government had \"staked [President Fernandez's] political career on fighting the holdouts.\" In June 2015, the Argentine government announced that it would not negotiate with holdout creditors due to \"unwarranted attacks,\" maintaining that the holdouts \"have sought orders freezing immune diplomatic assets ... and sought to thwart clearly legitimate domestic debt issuances.\" ", "Argentina's policy stance toward the holdouts changed dramatically after President Macri took office in December 2015. Macri quickly moved to pursue a number of economic reforms to strengthen Argentina's economy, repair its \"rogue debtor\" reputation, and attract foreign investment. Reaching a settlement with the holdouts was viewed as key to achieving these goals, and the new government restarted negotiations with the holdouts before a court-appointed mediator in January 2016. In early February, Argentina settled with a group of Italian bondholders for $1.35 billion and with two of the six largest hedge funds for $1.1 billion. ", "As negotiations with the remaining holdouts continued, Argentina appealed to the New York judge, Thomas Griesa, that the injunction preventing Argentina from paying holders of the restructured bonds should be lifted, given Argentina's willingness to bargain with the hedge funds. On February 19, Griesa agreed, saying that Macri's election had \"changed everything.\" The judge's decision increased pressure on the remaining holdouts to reach a deal. The Argentine government reached a deal with four of the remaining hedge funds, including Elliott Management, one of the leading creditors in the dispute, on February 29. The deal provided about 25% less than the hedge funds were claiming, but it also was a gain of roughly 10 to 15 times the hedge funds' initial investment. With this deal, agreements will have been reached with 85% of the disputed debt. An additional 115 individual creditors holding defaulted sovereign bonds also reached a settlement with the Argentina in mid-March.", "Implementing the new agreements required legislative action to repeal laws that prevented Argentina from paying holdouts. The Argentine Congress approved the repeal of these laws in March, even though Macri's party is in a minority position in both houses. In April, the Argentine government successfully sold bonds totaling $16.5 billion on international capital markets, its first since the 2001 default and the largest emerging-market debt sale on record. It used a large portion of the proceeds ($9.3 billion) to pay holdout creditors. This payment led Griesa to lift the injunctions that had prevented Argentina from paying other creditors.

In January 2013, Argentina announced that it had reached an agreement with Iran and signed a memorandum of understanding to establish a joint Truth Commission made up of impartial jurists from third countries to review the bombing case. After extensive debate, Argentina's Congress completed its approval of the agreement in February 2013. Argentina's two main Jewish groups, AMIA and the Delegation of Israeli Associations (DAIA), strongly opposed the agreement because they believe that it could guarantee impunity for the Iranian suspects. Several Members of the U.S. Congress also expressed their strong concerns about the Truth Commission because they believed it could jeopardize Argentina's AMIA investigation and charges against the Iranians.", "In May 2013, Nisman issued a 500-page report alleging that Iran has been working for decades in Latin America, setting up intelligence stations in the region by utilizing embassies, cultural organizations, and even mosques as sources of recruitment. In the report, Nisman highlighted the key role of Mohsen Rabbani (one of eight Iranian officials wanted by Argentina for the AMIA bombing) as Iran's South America \"coordinator for the export of revolution,\" working in the tri-border countries of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay as well as in Chile, Colombia, and Uruguay. The Nisman report contended that the 1994 AMIA bombing was not an isolated act but was part of a regional strategy involving Iran's establishment of intelligence bases in several countries using political, religious, and cultural institutions that could be used to support terrorist acts.", "In May 2014, an Argentine court declared unconstitutional the agreement with Iran to jointly investigate the AMIA bombing. Special Prosecutor Nisman had maintained that the agreement with Iran constituted an \"undue interference of the executive branch in the exclusive sphere of the judiciary.\" The Fern\u00e1ndez government maintained that it would appeal the ruling to Argentina's Supreme Court. In a speech before the U.N. General Assembly on September 24, 2014, President Fern\u00e1ndez acknowledged the 20 th anniversary of the AMIA bombing and expressed support for the memorandum of understanding with Iran, maintaining that it would enable the accused Iranian citizens to make statements before an Argentine judge. ", "On January 14, 2015, Nisman made explosive accusations that President Fern\u00e1ndez and other government officials attempted to whitewash the AMIA investigation to secure oil supplies from Iran and restore Argentina's grain exports to Iran. However, just four days later, and one day before he was to testify before Argentina's Congress, Nisman was found dead in his apartment from a gunshot wound. Although preliminary reports indicated that Nisman committed suicide, a majority of Argentines, including President Fern\u00e1ndez, contend that Nisman was murdered. The president maintained that Nisman was misled into making the accusations against her government by elements in Argentina's Intelligence Secretariat (SI) that had conducted illegal wiretaps of government officials. Fern\u00e1ndez called for the dissolution of the SI, and in February 2015, Argentina's Congress approved a measure setting up a new intelligence service, the Federal Agency of Investigations (AFI). Nisman's death prompted a massive demonstration in Argentina, with tens of thousands of participants. A federal prosecutor in Argentina pursued Nisman's case against President Fern\u00e1ndez related to Iran, but the case was thrown out by several Argentine courts and ultimately dismissed by the country's highest appellate court in April 2015. ", "In the aftermath of Nisman's death, Argentina's attorney general appointed a team of four lawyers in February 2015 to continue the work of the AMIA investigation. Court proceedings began in Buenos Aires in August 2015 against 13 former officials alleged to be involved in efforts to cover up the 1994 bombing investigation. The suspects include former President Carlos Menem (1989-1999), former judge Juan Jos\u00e9 Galeano, two former prosecutors who conducted investigations during the 1990s, three former intelligence officials, two former police officials, a former head of DAIA, and the owner of a van used in the AMIA bombing.", "Efforts Under the Macri Administration. As noted above, soon after his election in 2015, President Macri dropped an appeal that was started by the Fern\u00e1ndez government against a 2014 Argentine court ruling that declared unconstitutional the agreement with Iran to jointly investigate the AMIA bombing. In December 2015, President Macri established a special unit within the Justice Ministry to investigate the AMIA bombing. The head of the new unit, former UCR leader Mario Cimadevilla, maintained that Macri's election opened up a new route into solving the case and praised President Macri's decision to drop the agreement with Iran to jointly investigate the AMIA bombing.", "The investigation into Nisman's death continues, although observers are skeptical that the truth will be uncovered. In December 2015, a week after President Macri took office, Judge Fabiana Palmaghini took over the investigation of Nisman's death from the prosecutor in the case. On the anniversary of Nisman's death in January 2016, President Macri ordered the declassification of all state information related to Nisman since September 2012, when Argentina's talks with Iran over AMIA reportedly began. In March 2016, just hours after former Secretariat of Intelligence head Antonio Stiuso testified that Nisman had been killed by a group with ties to former President Fern\u00e1ndez, Judge Palmaghini ruled that the case should be elevated to the federal courts. The case went to Argentina's federal court in April 2016 but in June 2016 was returned to Judge Palmaghini's jurisdiction until September 2016, when the case was once again elevated to the federal courts.", "President Macri has said that he will be respectful of the judicial process but stated in a September 2016 press interview that he believes Nisman was murdered. The president said that a \"definitive investigation\" is needed to find out how Nisman died and that he wants Argentina's justice system to carry out the investigation with total independence.", "In December 2016, an Argentine court reopened the case against former President Fern\u00e1ndez and other government officials (the complaint originally filed by Nisman) for their alleged role in whitewashing Iran's involvement in the 1994 AMIA bombing."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Outlook", "paragraphs": ["President Mauricio Macri's government has ushered in significant changes to Argentina's economic and foreign policies since his inauguration to a four-year term in December 2015. The Macri government has moved ahead with market-friendly economic policies, including the elimination of currency controls, the elimination or reduction of taxes on agricultural exports, a revamp of inflation statistics, and a resolution of the long-standing dispute with holdout creditors. Economic adjustment measures triggered an economic downturn in 2016, with GDP declining by almost 2.3%, but also are leading to more sustainable growth in 2017, with a forecast for 2.2% growth. President Macri largely has had success receiving approval from Argentina's Congress for his reform agenda, but given that Macri's party and electoral coalition have only a minority in Congress, the government could face difficulty in the future. This is especially true as the country approaches legislative elections in October 2017, which many observers see as a referendum on the policies of the Macri government. In the foreign-policy arena, the Macri government has improved relations with neighboring Brazil and Uruguay, the promarket countries of the Pacific Alliance, and the UK. It also has spoken out strongly about the situation in Venezuela. ", "U.S.-Argentine relations have greatly improved under the Macri government compared to under the Kirchner governments, when the bilateral relationship was often tense. Macri's election brought to power a government that to date has demonstrated a strong commitment to constructive bilateral relations. The Obama Administration moved swiftly to engage the Macri government, highlighted by President Obama's state visit to Argentina in 2016 and the launching of a High-Level Dialogue in August 2016. ", "Relations continue to be positive under the Trump Administration, with President Macri visiting the White House on April 27, 2017. The two leaders discussed ways to deepen relations on a host of areas, including trade and investment, combatting illicit financial activities, cyber policy, and the situation in Venezuela. Members of Congress have expressed support for strong relations with Argentina; the House approved a resolution in April 2017 and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee reported a similar resolution in June that upheld commitment to the partnership between Argentina and the United States and encouraged the State Department to coordinate a new interagency strategy to increase cooperation with Argentina in areas of bilateral, regional, and global concern.
