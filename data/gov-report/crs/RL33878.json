Malaysia's major opposition parties won 82 of the 222 parliamentary seats up for election. In addition, the opposition parties won control of five of Malaysia's 13 state governments. The election results are widely seen as a vote against the current policies of the Malaysian government, which could have implications for relations with the United States.", "Prior to the elections, the bilateral relationship has been generally positive and constructive, particularly in the area of trade. Malaysia is a key trading partner of the United States and is regarded as an effective and cooperative regional player in the war against terror. The United States and Malaysia also have informal defense ties including commercial access to Malaysian ports and repair facilities. Despite these positive dynamics, the bilateral relationship has at times been strained. Past differences have stemmed from disagreements between Malaysia's former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and the United States over such issues as the internal suppression of dissent in Malaysia, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Iraq, globalization, Western values, and world trade policy. Relations are perceived as having improved since Abdullah Badawi became prime minister in 2003.", "After years of strong economic growth, Malaysia has become a middle income country. Much of its gain in economic prosperity has come from the export of electronics and electrical products, with the United States as its top export market.

Building on their common perspective of international trade, Malaysia and the United States concluded a trade and investment framework agreement in 2004 and are currently negotiating a bilateral free trade agreement. Key issues still to be resolved in the negotiations principally revolve around market access for key goods and services in both the United States and Malaysia, and intellectual property rights protection in Malaysia.

Aziz has been an important figure in U.S.-Malaysian trade relations. It is unclear what impact, if any, the new cabinet will have on Malaysia's policies.", "The dramatic drop in support for two of Malaysia's ethnically-based political parties\u2014the MCA and the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC)\u2014has also led to calls for political changes. Gerakan party chief Datuk Chang Ko Youn, who lost his seat in the parliament to a DAP candidate, has suggested that BN member parties should consider eliminating ethnic restrictions on party membership as a first step to the formation of a single party. However, MIC president Seri S. Samy Vellu, who also lost his bid for reelection to the parliament to an opposition candidate, rejected Chang's suggestion, saying \"such an action will dilute the rights of the Indian community.\" Some commentators have suggested that the shift in Chinese and Indian support to opposition party candidates reflects a growing sense among Malaysia's influential ethnic minorities that the BN no longer adequate reflects their interests. Others attribute the desertion of the BN by Malaysia's Chinese and Indian to economic issues, such as food price inflation and rising income disparities.", "The strengthening of opposition party power in the Dewan Rakyat and in state governments is also expected to restrict the power of Badawi and the BN to implement changes in policy. The loss of a supermajority in the Dewan Rakyat is considered by some a psychological and political blow to the BN, which has ruled virtually unchallenged in Malaysia since independence. There is discussion that the election results may be the first sign that politics in Malaysia are starting the process of transformation into a two-party, non-ethnic system, and possibly a more truly democratic process.", "In addition, opposition control of five of Malaysia's 13 states may also curtail Badawi's power. For example, the new state government in Penang has already announced that it will no longer abide by the BN's long-standing \"New Economic Policy\" that grants preferential treatment to Malaysia's bumiputera . However, a past judicial tradition of broadly interpreting the federal government's power under Malaysia's constitution may mitigate the opposition's ability to use the state governments to exert power or influence.", "A final concern raised by the BN's weak showing in the 2008 is the potential for social unrest and governmental policy change. The last time the BN (or its predecessors) did as poorly in a parliamentary election was in 1969. Following the 1969 elections, there were violent ethnic riots in Malaysia between May and July (precipitated by the \"May 13 Incident\" in Kuala Lumpur) during which approximately 200 people were killed. Following the riots of 1969, the BN announced a series of economic reforms, known as the \"New Economic Policy\" (NEP). The events of 1969 are discussed in more detail below. However, in the weeks following the election, there has been virtually no violence or ethnic unrest in Malaysia.", "For U.S.-Malaysia relations, the 2008 elections will have little direct or immediate impact, with the possible exception of the removal of Aziz as Minister of International Trade and Industry.

Malaysia inherited a diverse demographic mix from the British. Through the importation of labor, the British added ethnic Chinese and Indians to the Malay and other indigenous populations of peninsular Malaya, Sabah, and Sarawak. The demographic composition of Sabah and Sarawak includes a higher percentage of indigenous groups, such as the Iban. Together the Malay and indigenous population\u2014collectively known as the bumiputeras \u2014comprise about 58% of the population compared to 24% for the Chinese and 7% for the Indians. Traditionally, ethnic Chinese and Indians have controlled a disproportionately greater share of the nation's wealth than bumiputeras.", "Malaysia has a complex history of inter-communal politics. A British plan after World War II to create the Malaysian Union that incorporated all of the Malayan territories except Singapore would have provided for common citizenship regardless of ethnicity. Concerns among the Malays that they could not compete with the more commercially-minded Chinese led to the creation of UMNO\u2014a conservative, Malay nationalist organization that later reformed itself into a political party. Negotiations between the British and UMNO led to the creation of the Federation of Malaya in 1948, which included Singapore and provided special rights for the bumiputeras and Malaysia's sultans. Sabah and Sarawak joined the Federation to form Malaysia later in 1963, while Singapore left the Federation in 1965. At independence in 1957, there was an understanding that Malays would exert a dominant position in political life in Malaya, while ethnic Chinese and Indians would be given citizenship and allowed to continue their role in the economy.", "This accommodation between Malaysia's ethnic groups has not always been tranquil. Between 1948 and 1960, the Communist Party of Malaysia, which was largely comprised of ethnic Chinese, waged a guerilla war against the British. This came to be known as the \"Malayan Emergency.\" The Internal Security Act (ISA), which continues to be used to suppress groups that threaten the regime, originally was put in place by the British to combat \"communist subversion.\" The Special Branch, which Malaysia inherited from the British, continues to act as the primary intelligence and security unit under the Royal Malaysian Police. During the \"Emergency,\" Malays generally sided with the British against the communists whose ranks were drawn largely from the Chinese community. By the mid-1950s, the insurrection had collapsed.", "Added to this history of inter-communal strife were the riots of May to July 1969 in which reportedly 196 were killed. Most of those killed were ethnic Chinese. Rioting began on May 13, three days after the Alliance Party, a predecessor to the BN, failed to win two-thirds of the seats in the Dewan Rakyat , and lost control of Selangor and Perak. Much like the results of the 2008 elections, one of the main losers in the 1969 elections was MCA, which lost 14 of its 27 seats in the Dewan Rakyat . Because of the rioting, elections to be held in Sabah and Sarawak were suspended and a state of emergency was declared.", "Partly in response to the 1969 riots, the New Economic Policy (NEP) was instituted in 1971. NEP provided preferential treatment for the bumiputera majority via a kind of quota system in order to increase their share of the economic wealth of the country. The New Development Policy (NDP) replaced the NEP in 1990. The NDP retained NEP goals, such as 30% bumiputera control of corporate assets. Prime Minister Mahathir's subsequent Vision 2020 policy had similar elements, but was more inclusive and attempted to do more to foster national ethnic unity.", "The BN appears to be relying on an expanding economy to be able to disproportionately favor bumiputeras, while not undermining its economic appeal to Malaysia's Chinese and Indian population. In this way, Malaysia's social harmony\u2014and support for the BN\u2014may be linked to economic growth.
