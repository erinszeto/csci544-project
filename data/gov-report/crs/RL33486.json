Representing apowerful and popular political force in the Arab world today, many Islamist political parties andorganizations are largely opposed, at least rhetorically, to key aspects of U.S. foreign policy in theMiddle East, such as support for Israel, the occupation of Iraq, and the large U.S. military presencein the Persian Gulf.

Yet, despite continuing reservations overU.S. sincerity, depth of commitment, and consistency on the democratization issue, the enormousattention that Middle East or Arab democratization has received in the years since the September 11thterrorist attacks is believed by many skeptics and advocates alike to have reverberated across theArab world, for better or for worse, sparking debate, anti-government demonstrations, andregime-manipulated elections to appease internal and external demands for democratization.

Would such engagement isolatekey Arab regimes whose cooperation is vital to waging the war on terrorism and securing other U.S.national security goals?

Non-Islamistreformers draw support from both secular intellectuals and minority religious/ethnic communities,who have traditionally been relegated to second-class status. Secular intellectuals, members of someminority groups, and women's rights advocates are frequently accused of collaborating withforeigners because their vision of democracy may closely resemble the liberal democracies ofWestern Europe and the United States. Ruling elites in the military and private sector, who oftenhave manipulated the state system to obtain a minimum of popular support, have created their own\"national identities\" to reinforce their rule. Some regimes have created secular republics dominatedby one ruling party and the military.

Through their extensive social welfare networks, Islamists have createdalternative state structures that serve to reinforce their appeal among the lower and middle classes.", "There are many examples across the Middle East of legal or semi-legal Islamist organizationsthat have been granted either full or limited participation in the political system. Some of thesegroups have renounced violence and peacefully oppose their respective governments. Some regimeshave allowed their participation, in part because Islamist parties may act to bolster the strength ofthe one-party state or royal family. For example, when facing economic recession and large-scalepublic unrest, Arab governments sometimes have granted Islamist organizations more leeway inconducting opposition activities in order to relieve the political system of public pressure. Thus,non-violent Islamist groups have existed in an ambiguous position. On the one hand, regimes mayexaggerate the threat Islamists pose to state stability and therefore maintain that these groups areillegal. On the other hand, they may permit Islamists to conduct limited opposition activity if suchactivity ultimately benefits the regime.

To the extent that the United States pushed forregional reform, the focus was largely on economic reform and trade liberalization; concern over thelack of democratization and human rights was secondary.

(16) With a history of stable monarchical rule in which the King, as\"Commander of the Faithful,\" derives his religious authority from his dynasty's claimed descent fromthe prophet Muhammad, Morocco has accepted some Islamist political activity so long as Islamistsdo not challenge the king's authority. (17) The PJD has accepted such a bargain, and the relationshipbetween it and the palace, though at times confrontational, has overall been mutually beneficial.Moroccan authorities have sought to avoid the kind of bloody confrontation with Islamists thatplagued neighboring Algeria throughout the 1990s, but concern remains over the proliferation ofJihadist terrorist groups, like Al Qaeda, that seek to recruit Moroccans at home and abroad. Thus,Morocco has chosen a path of inclusion rather than exclusion in order to lure Islamists away frommilitancy and toward more legitimate means of political participation. There also may be aneconomic reason to allow Islamists into the political system. Morocco, which lacks natural resourceslike oil and depends on foreign aid and trade with the West, has an economic incentive to maintainits momentum on the reform front, particularly given the recent focus by Morocco's key tradingpartners in Europe and the United States on democracy and human rights promotion.

Reportedly, the PJDcovets the Social Affairs and Education ministerial portfolios, where it could pursue an Islamistagenda.", "Due to its participation in the Moroccan political system, some have called the PJD the\"Islamists of the palace,\" though observers note that the PJD's aggressive campaigning among lower-and middle-class Moroccans has made the group more popular than many of Morocco's older andmore established parties. (19) Nevertheless, the aspirations of the PJD remain limited, as it hasconsistently sided with the monarchy, even on issues that would appear to contravene a conservativeinterpretation of Islamic law, such as their acceptance of King Muhammad's 2004 groundbreakingrevision of the family code ( Mudawana ), which, among other things, raised the legal age formarriage for women from 15 to18 and allowed women to divorce with a judge's approval. The PJDargued that because the family code revision was democratically enacted, its members should acceptit, since the party is committed to both democratic and Islamic principles.

In an uncertain political climate, in which oppositionfigures like the Yassines have become emboldened and regimes have grown more wary of politicaldissent, the prosecution of Nadia Yassine has drawn widespread international attention.

One recent assessment of the JCO'spolitical program stated \"The group's leadership has such faith in the moral and spiritual power ofits movement that it assumes that once Moroccans are sufficiently familiar with the group, they willsupport it en masse and will also support the imposition of Islamic law, or Sharia .\" (26) ", "In 2005 and 2006, Nadia Yassine made several visits to the United States to speak on collegecampuses and promote her new book.

She also noted that 30% of the JCO's internal consultative ( Shura ) council is composed of women. Yassine alsoopposes a quota system for women in government or parliament because she believes that suchsystems, found in other parts of the Arab world, are insulting to women.

I also think it is normal for the U.S. government to develop andmaintain contacts with a wide variety of legitimate political actors in a country, including those thatmay not like some elements of U.S. foreign policy.\" (35) ", "U.S. officials in Morocco state that the United States should pursue a policy of engagementwith the PJD rather than ignore it. In May 2006, the U.S. State Department's International Visitor'sProgram sponsored a visit by the PJD's leader, 50-year old Saad Eddine Othmani. In a sign that thePJD itself may be eager to expand dialogue with the United States, the party sponsored a March 2006conference in Morocco entitled, \"American Decision Making and its Impact on theMoroccan-American Relations.\" When asked about U.S. democracy promotion policy in the MiddleEast, Othmani remarked that \"We cannot deny the role of external factors, but the reforms have notbeen simply imposed from outside.... The U.S. administration cannot achieve its goals at ourexpense, and should seek to build trust and identify common interests through a cooperativedialogue.\" (36) ", "U.S. engagement is complicated by internal divisions within Islamist organizations such asthe PJD, in which liberal and conservative factions vie for influence. The PJD, while outwardly moremoderate in its political discourse, has its hardliners, many of whom are opposed to better relationswith the West and may be more emboldened following the Hamas victory in the January 2006Palestinian legislative elections. (37) The PJD's leadership must balance its more progressive approachto politics with the needs of conservative Islamist party members. When asked about its relationswith the United States and U.S. policy in Iraq, one PJD leader remarked that, \"I'm not in favor ofmeeting Americans who are on official missions. They are killing Muslim people.... I am againstany relation with them. If they say they are going to leave Iraq, I don't have any problem withmeeting them. Our position is very clear. We don't approve their policy.\" (38) ", "Thus, the party has occasionally boycotted some U.S. embassy-sponsored events, particularlyduring times of regional tension. The PJD has demonstrated against the U.S. presence in Iraq andhas criticized the United States and European Union for ending all direct support for the PalestinianAuthority following the 2006 Hamas victory. Nevertheless, PJD leader Saad Eddine Othmani hasbeen cautious in his remarks on Hamas, stating in a recent interview that the Hamas victory \"was amajor event that marked both the victory of democracy and of the strategy of resistance to theoccupation. Hamas in government will be different from the Hamas in the opposition, and I do notrule out the possibility of its moving towards a search for a peaceful solution.\" (39) ", "Overall, U.S. policy makers have been careful not to overemphasize U.S. contacts with thePJD, since there continues to be widespread public skepticism in Morocco of all political parties, thePJD included. The United States may welcome more European Union cooperation with Islamistsgroups since EU intentions are far less suspect among Moroccans in general. (40) Observers have focusedintently on the 2007 parliamentary elections, speculating whether the PJD will decide to or bepermitted to run the maximum number of candidates. In past elections, the PJD succumbed togovernment pressure and fielded candidates in just 20%-30% of electoral contests. The PJD, like theUnited States, takes a gradualist approach to political reform in Morocco. Also, it may not want torelinquish its position in the opposition, which according to some officials, allows it to comfortablycriticize government corruption and inefficiency without having the responsibility of running thecountry's day-to-day affairs. (41) Others suggest that the PJD might participate in the next coalitiongovernment to develop experience in governance and improve its electoral chances in the 2012elections. ", "Some commentators are dismayed by any U.S. government dealings with MoroccanIslamists, asserting that the ultimate goal of all Islamist groups is the establishment of anon-democratic state based on Islamic law (Sharia) . These experts argue that the PJD's non-violentapproach to politics masks its ultimate non-democratic agenda and that non-violence is merely atactic rather than an end goal. According to Dr. Robert Satloff, Executive Director of the WashingtonInstitute for Near East Policy, ", "The spread of radical Islamism, not U.S. unpopularity,is the most serious challenge to U.S. interests in many Arab and Muslim societies. The solution -- as frequently expressed by liberal Moroccans -- cannot be found in reaching an accommodation withIslamists... Anti-Islamist Moroccans complain that Washington sends the wrong message when itprovides parliamentary training funds that are used by Islamist legislators to become more effectivecritics of the government. (42)", "Critics contend that U.S. policy should be exclusively focused on promoting democratic alternativesto Islamists. U.S. government officials insist that they are not favoring groups like the PJD and treatall Moroccan parties equally. Some Moroccan media outlets have reiterated demands that the UnitedStates cease all contacts with Islamists, fearing that U.S. policy may inadvertently empowerorganizations like the PJD and perhaps lead to a Hamas-like outcome. For its part, the Moroccangovernment often warns U.S. observers that non-violent Islamists in Morocco view electoral politicsas a means to come to power and establish a theocracy in the kingdom.

Egypt, whichhas been at peace with Israel since 1979, received the largest amount of U.S. foreign assistance toArab countries until U.S. involvement in Iraq.

Furthermore, Egypt, unlikeMorocco, has a long history of violent confrontation with fundamentalist terrorist groups, which hasled the government to discredit all Islamists, militant and non-violent alike.

Moreover, despite an almostthree-decade commitment to non-violent opposition, the MB's radical history, its fundamentalistideologues, and younger and perhaps more militant members have prompted differences amongWestern observers over the issue of pursuing engagement with the group. Complicating mattersfurther is the steadfast opposition of the Egyptian government to any Western dealings with the MB.With terrorist activity resurfacing in Egypt, authorities may be even more resistant to furtherlegitimizing political Islamists. Nevertheless, some democracy experts believe that, over the longterm, Egypt and Western governments will ultimately have to engage with the MB since it is by farthe most powerful opposition group in Egypt. Others would rather see the West promote alternativesecular opposition groups. Finally, many observers believe that the issue of Islamist inclusion in thepolitical system is strictly an Egyptian domestic issue and that foreign involvement will only stokethe fires of Egyptian nationalism, further entrenching government opposition to reform. ", "Since its founding in 1928, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood has been the vanguard ofSunni political Islamism in the Arab world, as branches of the MB have spread to countries acrossthe region. Between 1930-1950, the movement grew increasingly militant in pursuit of its political,social, economic, and legal goals. By the late 1940s, the Brotherhood was presenting seriouschallenges to the Egyptian regime. Though it did assist the Egyptian Free Officers in overthrowingthe monarchy in 1952, the MB soon turned against Egypt's new military leaders and was violentlysuppressed and forced to go underground after a failed Brotherhood assassination attempt againstEgypt's second post-monarchical ruler, Prime Minister (and later President) Gamal Abdul Nasser in1954. With many members imprisoned and the organization badly weakened, the MB renouncedviolence in the early 1970s and its members were gradually allowed to reenter politics, though theorganization itself remains outlawed.", "Since the mid-1970s, the MB has fielded candidates in parliamentary elections by eitherjoining other opposition parties or, more recently, running as independents. In the 2000parliamentary elections, 17 independent candidates, who were regarded as Brotherhoodsympathizers, were elected. In 2005, Brotherhood-affiliated candidates won 88 seats in parliament(it agreed to contest only a limited number of seats). Though opinions vary on how much masssupport the Brotherhood commands, it is recognized by many Egyptians for its charitable and socialservices work and its support among the professional middle class. The MB controls many of theprofessional syndicates (associations), including those representing engineers, doctors, lawyers, andacademics.", "Although the MB has long renounced the use of violence, opinions differ whether thiscriterion alone should allow it to enter into mainstream politics. According to one scholar, \"Forsome, the movement is a reaffirmation of moral idealism, for others an outlet for frustration andresentment [in which] good and bad factors apparently are working together ... real religion andneurotic fanaticism, honest idealism and destructive frenzy. It would be wrong to deny the formerand perhaps dangerous to ignore the potentiality of the latter.\" (44) ", "The MB claims that it is in favor of Egyptian democratization. According to one of itsleaders, \"Since the early 1970s, in the context of [President Anwar]Sadat's liberalization, openingand dialogue, the Society adopted a new strategy, which relies on democracy as a means of changeand as an objective. Democracy is not incompatible with Islam; shura [consultation] is likedemocracy, it forces respect for basic liberties and the rights of women. We don't disagree with theWest on this, except that the West has left democracy behind.\" (45) In 2004, the MuslimBrotherhood published a 50-page declaration endorsing elections, reform, accountability, andnon-violence. Nevertheless, some doubt the MB's democratic credentials. Internally, the group istraditionally led by a septuagenarian or octogenarian \"Supreme Leader,\" who, in the past, was tiedto the movement's early leaders, including its founder, Hassan al Banna. Much of the inner workingsof the MB remain unknown to outsiders, fueling suspicions. ", "Due to Egypt's proximity to and involvement in the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, MBanti-Israeli rhetoric is particularly pronounced and anti-Semitic (although Egyptian state-ownedmedia outlets also fuel anti-Israeli incitement). In December 2005, MB leader Mohammed MahdiAkef said that the Nazi holocaust was a myth, reiterating comments made earlier by Iran's president,Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. (46) The Israeli-financed Middle East Media Research Institute(MEMRI) regularly translates Brotherhood statements on Israel and Judaism. In one dispatch fromApril 2006, MEMRI translated excerpts from a Brotherhood website for children, in which therereportedly were anti-Semitic passages that accuse Jews of murdering Muslim prophets. (47) ", "The Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood is one of the most vocal organizations rejecting thenormalization of Arab relations with Israel. Although the organization itself may not commit actsof terrorism against Israel, its leaders call for continued resistance to Israel's occupation ofPalestinian lands (and U.S. occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan). After the Hamas 2006 legislativevictory, the MB launched a fund-raising campaign on behalf of the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority.Despite Brotherhood condemnations of terrorist bombings aimed at tourist resorts in the EgyptianSinai Peninsula, MB leaders do not extend such condemnations to Palestinian terrorist attacksagainst Israeli civilians. According to MB leader Akef, \"Israel is an occupier, and it's the right of thepeople of the country to resist occupation by all means.\" (48) Whether such rhetoric would lead the MB, if it came to power,to abrogate Egypt's nearly three-decade long peace with Israel is an open question. Some expertsbelieve that, in a scenario in which the MB ascend to power, the Egyptian military would interveneto preserve the status quo. Others assert that, under the same scenario, economic realities would forcethe MB, despite its harsh rhetoric toward Israel, to be pragmatic and maintain Egypt's \"cold peace\"with Israel.", "Hizb Al Wasat (The Middle or Center Party).

Although the United Stateshas long advocated the promotion of human rights and political freedom in Egypt, most experts agreethat, prior to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, economic reform superseded politicalreform in the West's relations with Egypt, as well as other Middle Eastern countries. However, withthe recent push for democracy in the Middle East seen as a counterweight to Islamic militancy andintellectual and social stagnation, U.S. policy regarding Egypt has been reinvigorated, as policymakers seek to balance U.S. security and economic interests with U.S. democracy promotionpolicies. ", "U.S. officials have employed a variety of diplomatic tools to push for reform in Egypt. U.S.Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has made visits to Egypt and has spoken about the need forreform at the American University in Cairo and held meetings with political activists. The UnitedStates also has expanded its foreign aid and democracy programming activities in Egypt. In 2005,the State Department's Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) began distributing small grantsdirectly to NGOs in Egypt to support secular political activists and human rights groups, particularlyduring the presidential and parliamentary election seasons. (51) The United States has beenless willing to overtly pressure Egypt; though when Egyptian authorities arrested, tried, andimprisoned Ayman Nour, an opposition leader and runner-up in the 2005 presidential election, theUnited States protested and reportedly withheld announcing its intention to negotiate a long soughtafter U.S.-Egyptian free trade agreement. Although some have labeled Nour as an opportunist andminor political figure, he represented a secular alternative to the ruling National Democratic Party(NDP), a tenuous position that the authorities may have deemed unacceptable. ", "Nevertheless, some analysts have questioned the depth of the U.S. commitment todemocratization in Egypt, particularly after the recent Hamas victory in Palestinian parliamentaryelections earlier this year. With the Hamas takeover of most of the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, theUnited States, and Israel have a shared purpose in containing Hamas and the spread of its violentIslamist influence into neighboring states. In this changed atmosphere, in which Egyptian securitycooperation on the Gaza-Egyptian border also is valued, some observers have speculated that U.S.policy makers may tone down their rhetoric on reform in Egypt. For example when the Egyptianparliament voted to approve the two-year extension the nation's 25-year old Emergency laws in April2006, a move long opposed by the United States, the Administration was careful not to overlycondemn the maneuver, particularly as it came only days after several deadly terrorist attacks in theSinai Peninsula.

Should the United States aggressively push for reform and run the risk of anationalist backlash or of empowering radical groups? Or should the United States patiently pursuelong-term modernization and institution-building programs that are largely regime-friendly andthereby run the risk of deflating the hopes of Egypt's liberals? Are there other paths to pursue?", "The United States respects the Egyptian government's desires not to allow illegal Islamistorganizations, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, to officially participate in U.S.-sponsored reformactivities in Egypt or have extensive contacts with U.S. diplomats in Cairo. Reportedly, U.S.non-governmental democracy organizations must ensure that no Brotherhood participants attendU.S.-funded seminars or training programs. Moreover, Egyptian law prohibits even legalorganizations or parties from accepting financial support from \"foreign entities.\" Nevertheless, theUnited States has not outrightly rejected having any contact with Brotherhood members. Accordingto the U.S. State Department, the United States will not deal directly with the Brotherhood since itis banned under Egyptian law, but Brotherhood members will not be barred from meetings betweenU.S. officials and parliament members. According to J. Scott Carpenter, Deputy Assistant Secretaryof State for Near East Affairs at the U.S. State Department, \"There is recognition that there are anumber of folks who have been elected to Parliament, and they are there. This is an issue forEgyptian society to deal with it, it's not something for us necessarily to involve ourselves with.\" (53) ", "Given these barriers, U.S. officials must be cautious in broaching the Islamist issue in Egypt.Still, according to some observers, the possibility for informal dialogue between the United Statesand some Egyptian Islamists exists. The Al Wasat organization, whose legal status is precarioussince it is an aspirant political party that has been unsuccessful in its registration attempts (rather thanan outright illegal organization like the Muslim Brotherhood), could be more amenable to futureparticipation in U.S.-government sponsored democracy training programs. However, U.S. policymakers would need to be careful about appearing to favor any one group in Egyptian politics. In June2006, the Egyptian government accused the local head of the International Republican Institute's(IRI) Egypt program of meddling in Egypt's internal affairs and demanded that the organizationtemporarily halt its activities there.

Although there are always individualmembers who may not be as resistant as most party members to participating in U.S. programs, forthe most part, only a few Brotherhood members interact with Western observers.

By limiting the realm of political space to either theruling National Democratic Party or the Muslim Brotherhood, Egyptian authorities have forced theWest to choose to support the regime or the MB with little else in between.

After the Brotherhood sided with King Hussein during the Black September crisis of 1970,in which the Palestinian Liberation Organization openly clashed with the Jordanian armed forces,King Hussein granted the Brotherhood control over the Education Ministry. Through its extensivecharitable networks, the Brotherhood also established a number of Sunni Muslim schools( Madhaheb ), in addition to institutions of higher education.

Three years before that,Jordanian Islamists running as independents gained almost 40% of the seats in parliament. Thegovernment responded by altering the electoral law, changing the system from a multiple/transferablevote system in which voters could cast as many ballots as there were seats in their constituency, toa one-person, one vote system, which led most voters to choose candidates from their extendedfamilies or tribes over ideological parties, such as the IAF.
