For example, information and data are publicly available that project spending, revenue, deficit, and debt levels in the long term, and in some instances, data evaluating the long-term outlook of specific programs are available. Congressional committees are useful resources for long-term budgeting as they gather information and make policy recommendations on individual programs, as well as the budget as a whole. In addition, Congress is able to develop and consider a multiyear budget plan in the form of a budget resolution. The budget resolution may also trigger the budget reconciliation process, which has been used to make legislative changes addressing long-term budgetary levels. Also, the House and Senate have internal rules that restrict or prohibit consideration of legislation that would have certain long-term budgetary effects (e.g., the PAYGO rule and the long-term deficit rule).

First, the Constitution grants Congress the power of the purse but does not prescribe or require any specific budgetary legislation or budgetary outcomes.

Congress has thus developed certain types of budgetary legislation as well as rules and practices that govern the content and consideration of that budgetary legislation. This collection of budgetary legislation, rules, and practices is referred to as the congressional budget process.

There is no consensus on what is meant by long term . For example, advocates of biennial budgeting (i.e., two-year budget resolutions, two-year appropriations legislation) sometimes characterize a two-year cycle as long-term budgeting. Some view the current 10-year budget window (described below) as being a form of long-term budgeting, while others consider long-term budgeting to span a lengthier period, such as 30 years or 50 years. ", "There is also no general consensus on what is required by long-term budgeting. Would it simply require Congress to stay informed of the long-term projections for spending, revenue, deficits, and debt? Would it require Congress to affirmatively vote annually on policies that are projected to continue year to year? Would it require Congress to adopt a long-term budget plan or long-term fiscal targets (e.g., debt-to-GDP ratio limits)?

According to CBO, federal debt held by the public is currently 78% of GDP, significantly higher than the 50-year average of 42%.

", "Many think of the budget as being decided annually, but most policies that dictate how much will be spent and collected are fixed. Mandatory spending makes up 70% of total spending, is generally set by laws enacted years or decades ago, and remains in effect without the need for annual congressional approval. (Mandatory spending includes Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, and interest on the debt.) Likewise, the collection of revenue as prescribed by the tax code continues without the need for legislative action. These mandatory spending and revenue policies change only if Congress and the President enact legislation making such changes. Under current law, these fixed spending and revenue policies are projected to result in increasing deficits and debt. Many argue that addressing rising deficit and debt in the long term would require policy changes. Another challenge associated with long-term budgeting is that any projected levels of spending and revenue are inherently uncertain. The further out spending and revenue are projected, the more uncertain they become. For example, within CBO's long-term budget projections (referenced above), the agency notes that such projections are \"very uncertain.\" CBO concludes that while debt as a percentage of GDP in 2049 would likely be much greater than it is today if current laws remain unchanged, many factors (e.g., labor force participation, productivity in the economy, interest rates on federal debt, and health care costs per person) may alter actual outcomes.", "Other challenges associated with long-term budgeting include the difficulty of budgeting for unforeseen events (such as military engagements, natural disasters, and downturns in the economy); underlying projection assumptions; and the problem of setting fiscal policy or establishing long-term goals that a future Congress may not support.
