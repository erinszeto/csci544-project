The program was reauthorized through FY2014 as part of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21; P.L. 112-141) and extended through May 31, 2015, as part of the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-159). Funding was authorized at $10.6 billion in FY2013 and $10.7 billion in FY2014, with the extension continuing the FY2014 level of funding for eight months. About 80% of the funding for the federal public transportation program comes from the mass transit account of the highway trust fund and about 20% from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury, although the mass transit account, itself, has received transfers from the general fund, including $4.8 billion in FY2010 and another $4.0 billion in FY2014.", "MAP-21 simplified the structure of the public transit program by eliminating some programs and consolidating others. The law also recast some discretionary programs as formula programs, strengthened FTA's role in safety oversight, and introduced performance management into the planning process. FTA's six major funding programs and their authorized funding shares are (1) Urbanized Area Formula, 42%; (2) State of Good Repair (SGR), 20%; (3) New Starts, 18%; (4) Rural Area Formula, 6%; (5) Bus and Bus Facilities Formula, 4%; and (6) Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities, 2%.", "The authorization of the public transportation program expires May 31, 2015. Extension or reauthorization legislation will be considered in the context of a federal budget deficit that has put pressure on many areas of federal spending, including public transportation assistance. Some Members of Congress have urged that transit spending be supported mostly at the local level. Others argue for higher federal spending to address a backlog of capital expenditures, growing transit and paratransit ridership, and the desirability of encouraging use of public transportation. There has also been pressure to increase federal support of operating expenditures due to budget problems at the local level.", "An obstacle to greater federal spending, however, is the condition of the highway trust fund. Over the past few years the revenue flowing to the mass transit account has been less than its outlays, a situation that is expected to continue under current law. The primary revenue source for the highway trust fund, the fuels tax, was last raised in 1993. The precarious situation of the mass transit account may require some action before the end of FY2015, depending on the actual amounts of revenue and outlays, but action will almost certainly be needed in FY2016 and beyond. This might involve a cut in program spending, an increase in revenues paid in to the account, or another transfer from the general fund.", "Other issues that may come up in the debate are privatization and the operation of the New Starts program. Privatization, such as competitive contracting, is frequently touted as a means of controlling costs and improving quality in public transportation. Consequently there have been proposals in Congress for the federal government to promote greater private-sector involvement, and these might come up again in reauthorization. MAP-21 made several changes to the New Starts program to speed project delivery and to allow spending on expanding existing transit rail and other fixed guideway systems. How well these changes work may be an issue in reauthorization, as might the types of projects funded, particularly streetcar and bus rapid transit projects."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Federal assistance to public transportation is provided primarily through the public transportation program administered by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA).

About 51% of public transportation trips are made by bus, 35% by heavy rail, 5% by commuter rail, and 5% by light rail (including streetcars). Paratransit accounts for about 2% of all public transportation trips, and ferries less than 1%.", "Transit ridership dropped precipitously at the end of the Second World War due to a number of interrelated factors, particularly rising incomes, growing automobile availability and use, and residential and employment decentralization. Despite the longer-term downward trend, ridership has risen over the past two decades from a low of 7.8 billion trips in 1995 to 10.6 billion trips in 2012. Consequently, ridership is at a level not seen since the late 1950s, although the population has grown by about 140 million people since then.", "Public transportation accounts for about 2% of all daily trips and about 5% of trips to and from work (commute trips). Ridership is heavily concentrated in a few large cities and their suburbs. About 75% of all public transportation trips are made in 10 large urbanized areas: New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, San Francisco, Boston, Philadelphia, Seattle, Miami, and Atlanta. The New York City urbanized area alone, including parts of New Jersey and Connecticut, accounts for about 4 of every 10 public transportation trips nationally. Almost a third of workers in the New York metropolitan area commute by public transportation, but in only four others (San Francisco, Washington, Boston, and Chicago) does the share exceed 10%.

In the mid-1960s, with much lower ridership than existed at the end of World War II and mounting debts, many private transit companies were reorganized as public entities, and federal funding was initially used to recapitalize them. Today, most federal support still goes for capital projects, but the program has evolved to support operational expenses in some circumstances, as well as safety oversight, planning, and research.", "MAP-21 authorized $10.6 billion for the federal public transportation program in FY2013 and $10.7 billion in FY2014. Funding made available for those years in appropriations bills was slightly higher ( Table 1 ). The Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 extends the FY2014 authorized funding level though May 31, 2015. Excluding funding provided in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5 ) and the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 (DRAA; P.L. 113-2 ), public transportation program funding has been between $10 billion and $11 billion since 2009 ( Figure 1 ). ARRA provided an extra $8.4 billion in FY2009. DRAA provided $10.9 billion in FY2013 for FTA's Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program in response to Hurricane Sandy, particularly to repair the damage to the public transportation systems of New York and New Jersey. About 5% of the $10.9 billion, approximately $545 million, was subject to sequestration, leaving about $10.3 billion for emergency relief. ", "Typically, about 80% of federal public transportation program funding comes from the mass transit account of the highway trust fund and 20% comes from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury. It should be noted, however, that the distinction between money from the highway trust fund and money from the general fund has become artificial to an extent, in that Congress authorized a $4.8 billion transfer of general fund money into the mass transit account of the highway trust fund in FY2010 and another $4.0 billion transfer in FY2014. Moreover, ARRA and DRAA funding for public transportation came exclusively from the general fund.", "Public transportation also receives support through provisions that make it an allowable use of some federal highway funds. Most funds \"flexed\" to transit programs come from the Surface Transportation Program (STP) and the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ). Flexing is at the discretion of state and local decision-makers, so the amount transferred from highways to public transportation can vary widely from year to year. About $1 billion was flexed in FY2009, whereas $2.4 billion was flexed in FY2012. The percentage of highway funds transferred to transit has ranged from about 2.0% in FY1998 to about 5.7% in FY2012.", "The Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) program has been another source of federal funding for public transportation over the past few years. Enacted initially as part of ARRA, the TIGER program has been funded in five subsequent appropriations bills. Funding, appropriated from the general fund, was $1.5 billion in FY2009, $600 million in FY2010, $527 million in FY2011, $500 million in FY2012, $474 million in FY2013 (after an across-the-board rescission and sequestration), and $600 million in FY2014. Of the $584 million awarded in FY2014, for example, $187 million (32%) went to transit projects.", "Special-needs paratransit is another area in which funding is available from the federal government outside the public transportation program. Special-needs paratransit, also known as demand response or dial-a-ride, is non-fixed-route service for people with disabilities and the elderly, and typically involves the use of small buses, vans, or passenger cars. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has identified 73 federal programs in seven federal agencies other than the Department of Transportation (DOT) that fund special-needs transportation services. Although GAO could not estimate the transportation spending in all of these programs, in 21 programs for which data were available transportation funding amounted to $2.3 billion in FY2010.

In general, federal public transportation programs allow an 80% maximum federal share for capital projects and a 50% maximum share for operating expenses.", "Operating costs account for about two-thirds of all costs for public transportation and capital expenditures for about one-third.

These arguments are often buttressed by infrastructure needs assessments, a number of which have been conducted over the past few years. All of these assessments estimate a substantial gap between current levels of public transportation capital spending and the amount required to prevent an overall deterioration in the condition of public transportation assets and ultimately operational performance. For example, in its most recent report on the condition and performance of highway and public transportation systems, DOT estimates that to bring transit assets up to a good state of repair over the next 20 years would cost about $2 billion more per year than is currently being expended by all levels of government (in 2010 dollars).

Congress has chosen to transfer general fund monies into the mass transit account to maintain the balance above a minimum prudent level ( Figure 3 ).", "The primary revenue source for the highway trust fund is the fuels tax. Currently, of the 18.3 cents-per-gallon tax on gasoline and 24.3 cents per gallon on diesel that go to the highway trust fund, 2.86 cents is deposited in the mass transit account. The tax was last raised in 1993. The revenue from the fuels tax for the mass transit account is about $5 billion a year, an amount that is not expected to change very much at the current tax rate. Revenue from the fuels tax and funds flexed from the highway account together amount to about $6 billion per year in total receipts, excluding transfers from the general fund. Outlays from the mass transit account are expected to be about $8 billion in FY2014, and are projected to grow to about $9 billion in FY2018.", "According to CBO's estimates, the balance in the mass transit account will reach zero toward the end of FY2015, although a balance of $1 billion is low enough to create cash flow problems in the account. A balance of $1 billion or less would likely require some kind of administrative action, such as slowing payments to transit agencies, or legislative action, such as a general fund transfer. Because of the imbalance between receipts and outlays, a more sustainable solution for the mass transit account would have to involve a cut in program spending, an increase in revenues paid in to the account, or a combination of the two. An increase in revenues to the mass transit account could involve a commitment to regular transfers from the general fund.", "Funding shortfalls in the highway account of the highway trust fund have also required general fund transfers. Consequently, actions will likely need to be taken in the highway program as well as the public transportation program. Like those in public transportation, actions in the highway program might involve a cut in program spending, an increase in revenues paid into the account, or another transfer from the general fund. Another possible solution, proposed in H.R. 7 (112 th Congress) during the 2012 debate over reauthorization of surface transportation programs, is to redirect revenues from the mass transit account to the highway account and to fund the transit account with a general fund appropriation. This was not a popular idea at the time and was dropped from the legislation approved by the House of Representatives.

First, funding directed specifically to buses was reduced by more than half, from $984 million in FY2012 to $421 million in FY2013 and $428 million in FY2014, although funding for other programs, which can be used for bus investment, was increased. Second, prior to MAP-21, the Bus and Bus Facilities Program was a heavily earmarked discretionary program that provided substantial sums of money to transit agencies at irregular intervals for large capital expenses, whereas MAP-21 directs smaller amounts to be distributed by formula annually. For small transit systems, these allocations may be too small to provide the resources necessary for substantial bus investments in a single year. To deal with these issues, the American Public Transportation Association has suggested \"the restoration of funding to the bus and bus facilities program and the return of a transparent and efficient discretionary element of the program.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Operating Support", "paragraphs": ["Federal operating support for public transportation in urbanized areas over 200,000 was largely eliminated in 1997 with the enactment of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21 st Century (TEA-21). TEA-21 continued to allow providers in urbanized areas under 200,000 to use federal funding for both capital and operating expenses, at their option. Because of the serious budget problems faced by many transit agencies whose local revenue sources have been squeezed, there has been pressure to increase the availability of federal funding for operating expenditures. One way in which Congress has done this in the past is by liberalizing the definition of \"capital expense\" in federal law, allowing federal capital funding to be used to pay for items traditionally considered operating expenses, such as maintenance.", "For the most part, MAP-21 maintained the prohibition on the use of federal funds for operating expenses in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more residents. However, it added an exception to this general prohibition that is generally known as the \"100 bus rule.\" MAP-21 permitted transit systems in these larger urbanized areas operating 76 to 100 buses in peak service to use 50% of their Urbanized Area apportionment for operating expenses. For transit systems operating 75 or fewer buses in the peak period, the allowable amount is 75%. MAP-21 did not include a provision contained in S. 1813 (112 th Congress) that would have allowed the use of Urbanized Area funds for operating expenses in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more residents with high unemployment rates.", "Congress is likely to face calls for providing transit operating support in reauthorization legislation. One approach to doing this was included in S. 3189 / H.R. 2746 (111 th Congress), which proposed to allow transit agencies operating 100 or more fixed-route buses to use a portion of Urbanized Area Formula Program funds for operating expenses. Agencies in urbanized areas of between 200,000 and 400,000 people would have been allowed to use up to 50% of program funding for operating purposes, with lesser shares allowed in larger urbanized areas. This measure was not enacted.", "Alternatively, Congress could consider eliminating federal transit operating assistance altogether. This might lead to improvements in productivity, as without federal support transit agencies might pay more attention to the cost-effectiveness of their services. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Private-Sector Involvement", "paragraphs": ["Many government-owned transit agencies contract with private companies to operate some or all of their services, and in some cases private contractors have taken responsibility for building as well as operating rail lines. Congress has periodically considered whether to encourage privatization. In the 112 th Congress, for example, H.R. 7 included a provision to increase the federal cost share of bus projects from 80% to 90% if the local transit agency contracted out at least 20% of fixed-route bus service. This idea was not adopted in MAP-21. A related issue is federal labor requirements in the transit industry, known as 13(c). As a precondition of federal transit funding 13(c) requires, among other things, the preservation of existing employment rights, privileges, and benefits and the continuation of collective bargaining rights. These protections are thought to be an impediment to privatization and, hence, advocates of privatization have often called for their repeal. Critics of privatization argue that cost savings, if there are any, typically come at the expense of employees in the form of lower wages and reduced benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Starts Program", "paragraphs": ["A common criticism of the New Starts program is the length of time required to develop and deliver projects, a criticism that several changes in MAP-21 sought to address. An issue in reauthorization, therefore, will likely be whether the changes in MAP-21 do actually speed the project process, and whether or not this has any effect on the quality of New Starts projects. In addition, MAP-21 is likely to result in a change in the types of projects funded, as newly eligible core capacity projects may divert funds that would otherwise go to building new systems and extending existing systems, and streetcar and bus rapid transit projects may become more prominent in the mix. The net result may be to reduce federal funding available for traditional light rail and heavy rail projects. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Special-Needs Paratransit", "paragraphs": ["Special-needs paratransit, also known as demand response or dial-a-ride, is non-fixed-route service for people with disabilities and the elderly, and typically involves the use of small buses, vans, or passenger cars. The demand for special-needs paratransit has grown relatively rapidly since the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ( P.L. 101-336 ) required that transit agencies with fixed-route service provide \"complementary paratransit\" to people unable to use fixed-route service due to a disability. Many communities offer a range of non-ADA paratransit services as well. Between 1991 and 2012 paratransit ridership tripled, compared with a 23% increase in public transportation ridership overall. The general aging of the population may portend growing demand in future years.", "In 2012, operating expenditure per passenger trip for paratransit was $23.33, compared with $3.66 for motor buses and $3.75 for transit service on average. Between 2002 and 2012, paratransit operating expenses doubled in inflation-adjusted terms. The growth in costs means that special-needs paratransit is taking an ever larger slice of transit agency operating budgets, limiting the resources available for fixed-route service. Paratransit accounted for 12% of public transit systems' operating costs in 2012, up from about 4% in 1991. As noted earlier, paratransit currently accounts for about 2% of all public transportation trips.", "Increasing costs and service demands may lead to pressure for greater federal help for special-needs paratransit. One question is whether Congress wishes to widen or narrow the level of service mandated by the ADA, a change with immediate cost implications. Without addressing the quality or quantity of service, Congress may seek to rein in the costs of special-needs paratransit by requiring or encouraging greater enforcement of eligibility rules; making fixed-route service as accessible as possible; improving the coordination of all paratransit and human services transportation; and encouraging greater use of wheelchair-accessible taxicabs. Some transit agencies already seek to control costs by providing travel training to persons with disabilities and allowing disabled riders to use fixed-route buses and rail systems for free, and such efforts could be encouraged in transit legislation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
