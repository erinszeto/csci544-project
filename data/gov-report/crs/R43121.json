The maritime industry seeks to enact a \"spending guarantee\" to spend down the surplus in the HMTF (see H.R. 335 and S. 218 ). Some harbor channels are reportedly not being maintained at their authorized depth and width, requiring ships with the deepest drafts to \"light load\" or wait for high tide. Harbors primarily used by fishing vessels or recreational craft have also complained of insufficient maintenance dredging.

This is the same approach that was proposed and enacted in FY2011-FY2013. The FY2014 Administration budget requested approximately $94 million in inland waterway spending from the IWTF, with an equal amount to be drawn from the General Fund of the Treasury.

In 1989, DOE established the Office of Environmental Management to consolidate its responsibilities for the cleanup of former nuclear weapons production facilities that had been administered under multiple offices. These cleanup efforts are broad in scope and include the disposal of large quantities of radioactive and other hazardous wastes generated over decades; management and disposal of surplus nuclear materials; remediation of extensive contamination in soil and groundwater; decontamination and decommissioning of excess buildings and facilities; and safeguarding, securing, and maintaining facilities while cleanup is underway. The Office of Environmental Management also is responsible for the cleanup of DOE facilities that were involved in civilian nuclear energy research, which also generated wastes and contamination. These research facilities add a non-defense component to the office's mission, albeit smaller in terms of the scope of their cleanup and associated funding. ", "Efforts to clean up the environmental legacy of nuclear weapons production and nuclear energy research represent the single largest environmental liability of the United States, exceeding the cleanup liability of Department of Defense facilities. The need for annual appropriations of several billion dollars for ongoing cleanup efforts at nuclear weapons production and nuclear energy research facilities has generated continuing interest within Congress about the long-term financial liability of the United States to address potential risks at these sites. How to ensure the protection of public safety, human health, and the environment in the most expedient and cost-effective manner has been a perennial issue in the appropriations debate.", "DOE has identified in excess of 100 facilities in over 30 states that historically were involved in the production of nuclear weapons and nuclear energy research for civilian purposes. The geographic scope of these facilities is substantial, collectively encompassing a land area of approximately 2 million acres. Cleanup remedies are in place and operational at the majority of these facilities. The responsibility for their long-term stewardship has been transferred to the Office of Legacy Management and other offices within DOE for the operation and maintenance of cleanup remedies and monitoring. See the \"Office of Legacy Management\" section of this report. Some of the smaller sites for which DOE initially was responsible were transferred to the Army Corps of Engineers in 1997 under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP). The cleanup of these sites is funded within the civil works budget of the Corps. (See Table 4 .) Once the Corps completes the cleanup of a FUSRAP site, it is transferred back to DOE for long-term stewardship under the Office of Legacy Management.", "Much work remains to be done at the facilities that are still administered by the Office of Environmental Management. DOE expects cleanup to continue for several years or even decades at some of these facilities, necessitating billions of dollars to fulfill the cleanup liability of the United States. As of the beginning of FY2013, the Office of Environmental Management had completed cleanup activities at 90 facilities in 30 states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and remains responsible for the cleanup of 17 facilities in 11 states at which cleanup was not yet complete. Although cleanup is scheduled to be complete at some of these facilities over the next several years, cleanup is expected to continue at some of the larger and more complex facilities for decades. The Hanford facility in the state of Washington has the lengthiest estimated time frame, with cleanup scheduled to continue possibly as late as 2066 based on more conservative assumptions. DOE estimates that the costs to complete the cleanup of these 17 facilities could range between $187.0 billion and $223.4 billion from FY2013 into the future, exceeding the past costs already incurred across the entire inventory of facilities. A substantial proportion of these funding needs and lengthy time frames is due to challenges in managing, treating, and disposing of millions of gallons of high-level radioactive wastes stored in hundreds of tanks at Hanford, the Savannah River facility in South Carolina, and the Idaho National Laboratory.", "Over time, DOE periodically has revised its estimates as project baselines and assumptions change. These estimates have varied widely over the years by many billions of dollars. For example, the above estimates of future costs are several billion dollars higher than DOE presented just the previous fiscal year. DOE typically estimates a range of costs, rather than a single dollar amount, to reflect uncertainties in the cleanup process. For example, final decisions have yet to be made at some facilities to determine the actions that will be necessary to remediate contamination. Methods to dispose of vast quantities of wastes, and the scheduling of these actions, also could affect cleanup costs and time frames. The costs of long-term stewardship also are excluded from the above cost estimates. Long-term stewardship entails an even greater degree of uncertainty considering the lengthy time frames of maintenance and monitoring once cleanup remedies are in place and operational, especially at sites where the cleanup method may entail the permanent containment of radioactive wastes in perpetuity.", "FY2014 appropriations for the Office of Environmental Management and Office of Legacy Management are discussed separately below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Office of Environmental Management", "paragraphs": ["Three appropriations accounts fund the Office of Environmental Management: Defense Environmental Cleanup, Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup, and the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning (D&D) Fund.

The Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup account funds the cleanup of wastes and contamination resulting from civilian nuclear energy research. Title XI of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 ( P.L. 102-486 ) established the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund to pay for the cleanup of three federal facilities that were used to enrich uranium for national defense and civilian purposes and to reimburse uranium and thorium licensees for their costs of cleaning up sites that supported these facilities.

These milestones establish time frames for the completion of specific actions to satisfy applicable requirements at individual facilities.", "According to DOE, the President's request of $5.62 billion for the Office of Environmental Management would have been sufficient to attain all cleanup milestones due in FY2014.

The House had proposed a decrease below the request, but in its report on H.R. 2609 , the House Appropriations Committee noted the \"need to ensure progress toward cleanup milestones\" and stated that the bill would \"sustain the pace of cleanup across the sites.\" The Senate Appropriations Committee had expressed a differing view and asserted that the House markup would have caused \"major cleanup milestones to be missed in Washington, New Mexico, South Carolina, Idaho, and Tennessee.\"", "As both the House and Senate had proposed, P.L. 113-76 did not include the $463 million that the President requested within the Defense Environmental Cleanup account to resume the federal payment to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund. Congress ceased the federal payment in FY2012. This payment historically has been treated as an offset to the funding for the Office of Environmental Management because the payment does not become available to DOE until Congress subsequently appropriates it out of the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund. The President also proposed to resume assessments on nuclear utilities in FY2014 to generate additional revenues, which would subject to the enactment of reauthorizing legislation. The authority to collect these assessments expired in October 2007. As authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 1992, both federal payments and nuclear utility assessments originally financed the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund based on the premise that the federal government and the nuclear utilities benefited from services provided by federal uranium enrichment facilities and that both therefore should share the costs of the cleanup of these facilities.", "The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimated an existing balance of $3.5 billion in the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund accrued from past nuclear utility assessments and federal payments that would be available for appropriation in FY2014. P.L. 113-76 appropriated $598.8 million from the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund in FY2014, leaving nearly $3.0 billion for appropriation in future fiscal years (plus accrued interest on the balance). DOE estimated in 2010 that the balance of the fund would be exhausted by FY2020 without additional revenues, leaving a shortfall of $11.8 billion to complete the cleanup of federal uranium enrichment facilities over the long-term. If the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund were fully expended, DOE still is responsible for the cleanup costs under existing law, subject to appropriations.", "Among the individual DOE facilities and supporting program activities, the various proposals considered in the FY2014 appropriations debate reflected differing funding priorities for the Office of Environmental Management.

DOE reports that funding needs for new sites, other new actions, and inflationary increases for various program elements have been partially offset in the near term through improvements in program and administrative efficiencies and a decrease in the need to contribute to former contractor workers' pension funds. However, funding needs for the Office of Legacy Management are likely to increase more significantly over the next decade, as additional facilities are cleaned up and transferred from the Office of Environmental Management and the FUSRAP program for long-term stewardship. DOE projects that the total number of facilities administered by the Office of Legacy Management will increase to 129 facilities by FY2020. ", "Estimating the long-term funding needs for the Office of Legacy Management is inherently challenging because of the lengthy time horizons that are involved. For example, actions may be necessary for many decades to operate and maintain cleanup remedies and monitor contaminant levels to ensure the effectiveness of the remedies over time. At sites where the cleanup entails the permanent containment of radioactive wastes, long-term stewardship may continue indefinitely because of the time needed for radioactive elements to decay to acceptable levels. Enforcement of land use restrictions or other institutional controls also may be necessary in perpetuity at facilities that are not cleaned up for unrestricted use, in order to prevent potentially harmful exposures.
