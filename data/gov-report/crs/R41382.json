If Congress decided to change it, there are at least five alternatives it might consider. Four of these are based on rounding fractions and one, on ranking fractions. The current apportionment system (codified in 2 U.S.C. 2a) also is based on rounding fractions.", "The Hamilton-Vinton method, used to apportion the House of Representatives from 1851-1901, is based on ranking fractions. First, the total population of the 50 states is divided by 435 (the House size) in order to find the national \"ideal sized\" district. Next, this number is divided into each state's population, producing the state's \"quota\" of seats. Each state is then awarded the whole number in its quota (but at least one). If fewer than 435 seats have been assigned by this process, the fractional remainders of the 50 states are rank-ordered from largest to smallest, and seats are assigned in this manner until 435 are allocated.", "The rounding methods, including the Hill method currently in use, allocate seats among the states differently, but operationally the methods only differ by where rounding occurs in seat assignments. Three of these methods\u2014Adams, Webster, and Jefferson\u2014have fixed rounding points. Two others\u2014Dean and Hill\u2014use varying rounding points that rise as the number of seats assigned to a state grows larger. The methods can be defined in the same way (after substituting the appropriate rounding principle in parentheses). The rounding point for Adams is (up for all fractions); for Dean (at the harmonic mean); for Hill (at the geometric mean); for Webster (at the arithmetic mean, which is 0.5 for successive numbers); and for Jefferson (down for all fractions). Substitute these phrases in the general definition below for the rounding methods:", "Find a number so that when it is divided into each state's population and resulting quotients are rounded (substitute appropriate phrase), the total number of seats will sum to 435.

Each apportionment method discussed in this report has a \"rational\" basis, and for each, there is at least one test according to which it is the most equitable. The question of how the concept of fairness can best be defined, in the context of evaluating an apportionment formula, remains open.

Justice Stevens noted, however, that \"although common sense\" supports a test requiring a \"good faith effort to achieve precise mathematical equality within each State ... the constraints imposed by Article I, \u00a72, itself make that goal illusory for the nation as a whole.\" He concluded \"that Congress had ample power to enact the statutory procedure in 1941 and to apply the method of equal proportions after the 1990 census.\"", "The year 1991 was a banner year for court challenges to the apportionment process. At the same time the Montana case was being argued, another case was being litigated by Massachusetts. The Bay State lost a seat to Washington because of the inclusion of 978,819 federal employees stationed overseas in the state populations used to determine reapportionment. The court ruled that Massachusetts could not challenge the President's decision to include the overseas federal employees in the apportionment counts, in part because the President is not subject to the terms of the Administrative Procedure Act.", "In 2001, the Census Bureau's decision to again include the overseas federal employees in the population used to reapportion the House produced a new challenge to the apportionment population. Utah argued that it lost a congressional seat to North Carolina because of the Bureau's decision to include overseas federal employees in the apportionment count, but not other citizens living abroad. Utah said that Mormon missionaries were absent from the state because they were on assignment: a status similar to federal employees stationed overseas. Thus, the state argued, the Census Bureau should have included the missionaries in Utah's apportionment count. The state further argued that, unlike other U.S. citizens living overseas, missionaries could be accurately reallocated to their home states because the Mormon Church has excellent administrative records. Utah's complaint was dismissed by a three-judge federal court on April 17, 2001.", "The Supreme Court appears to have settled the issue about Congress's discretion to choose a method to apportion the House, and has granted broad discretion to the President in determining who should be included in the population used to allocate seats.", "What, if any, challenges to the apportionment formula and process the country will face after the 2010 Census and apportionment remain to be seen.

House apportionments thereafter were to be based on Article 1, section 2, as modified by clause 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment:", "Amendment XIV, section 2. Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers....", "Article 1, section 2. The number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at least one Representative....", "The constitutional mandate that Representatives would be apportioned according to population did not describe how Congress was to distribute fractional entitlements to Representatives. Clearly there would be fractions because districts could not cross state lines and the states' populations were unlikely to be evenly divisible. From its beginning in 1789, Congress was faced with questions about how to apportion the House of Representatives. The controversy continued until 1941, with the enactment of the Hill (\"equal proportions\") method.", "During congressional debates on apportionment, the major issues were how populous a congressional district ought to be (later recast as how large the House ought to be), and how fractional entitlements to Representatives should be treated. The matter of the permanent House size has received little attention since it was last increased to 435 after the 1910 Census. The Montana legal challenge added a new perspective to the picture\u2014determining which method comes closest to meeting the goal of \"one person, one vote.\"", "The \"one person, one vote\" concept was established through a series of Supreme Court decisions beginning in the 1960s. The court ruled in 1962 that state legislative districts must be approximately equal in population ( Baker v. Carr , 369 U.S. 186). This ruling was extended to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1964 ( Wesberry v. Sanders , 376 U.S. 1). Thus far, the \"one person, one vote\" concept has only been applied within states. States must be able to justify any deviations from absolute numerical equality for their congressional districts in order to comply with a 1983 Supreme Court decision\u2014 Karcher v. Daggett (462 U.S. 725).", "The population distribution among states in the 2010 Census, combined with a House size of 435, and the requirement that districts not cross state lines, means that there is a wide disparity in district sizes\u2014from 527,624 (for Rhode Island's two congressional districts) to 994,416 (for Montana's single district) after the 2010 Census. This interstate population disparity among districts in 2010 contrasts with the intrastate variation experienced in the redistricting process. Thirty of the 43 states that had two or more districts in 2012 drew districts with a population difference between their largest and smallest districts of fewer than 10 and, of these, 26 states had a difference between their largest and smallest congressional district, with respect to population, of one or less. Only three states varied by more than 1,000 persons.", "Given a fixed-size House and an increasing population, there will inevitably be population deviations in district sizes among states. What should be the goal of an apportionment method? Although Daniel Webster was a proponent of a particular formula (the major fractions method), he succinctly defined the apportionment problem during debate on an apportionment bill in 1832 (4 Stat. 516). Webster said that,", "The Constitution, therefore, must be understood, not as enjoining an absolute relative equality, because that would be demanding an impossibility, but as requiring of Congress to make the apportionment of Representatives among the several states according to their respective numbers, as near as may be. That which cannot be done perfectly must be done in a manner as near perfection as can be.", "Which apportionment method is the \"manner as near perfection as can be\"? Although there are potentially thousands of different ways in which the House could be apportioned, six methods are most often mentioned as possibilities.

Why not apportion the House the intuitive way by dividing each state's population by the national \"ideal size\" district (710,767 in 2010) and give each state its \"quota\" (rounding up at fractional remainders of .5 and above, and down for remainders less than .5)? The problem with this proposal is that the House size would not always be 435 seats. In some decades, the House might include 435 seats; in others, it might be either under or over the legal limit. In 2012, this method would have resulted in a 433-seat House (433 in 2002, 438 in 1992).", "One solution to this problem of too few or too many seats would be to divide each state's population by the national \"ideal\" size district, but instead of rounding at the .5 point, allot each state initially the whole number of seats in its quota (except that states entitled to less than one seat would receive one regardless because of constitutional requirements). Next, rank the fractional remainders of the quotas in order from largest to smallest. Finally, assign seats in rank order until 435 are allocated (see Table 1 ). If this system were used in 2012, there would be no difference in the seat distribution relative to the current method (i.e., the method of equal proportions-Hill).", "This apportionment formula, which is associated with Alexander Hamilton, was proposed in Congress's first effort to enact an apportionment of the House. The bill was vetoed by President Washington\u2014his first exercise of this power. This procedure, which might be described as the largest fractional remainders method, was used by Congress from 1851 to 1901; but it was never strictly followed because changes were made in the apportionments that were not consistent with the method. It has generally been known as the Vinton method (for Representative Samuel Vinton (Ohio), its chief proponent after the 1850 Census). Assuming a fixed House size, the Hamilton-Vinton method can be described as follows:", "Hamilton-Vinton", "Divide the apportionment population by the size of the House to obtain the \"ideal congressional district size\" to be used as a divisor. Divide each state's population by the ideal district size to obtain its quota. Award each state the whole number obtained in these quotas. (If a state receives less than one Representative, it automatically receives one because of the constitutional requirement.) If the number of Representatives assigned using the whole numbers is less than the House total, rank the fractional remainders of the states' quotas and award seats in rank order from highest to lowest until the House size is reached.", "The Hamilton-Vinton method has simplicity in its favor, but its downfall was the \"Alabama paradox.\" Although the phenomenon had been observed previously, the \"paradox\" became an issue after the 1880 census when C. W. Seaton, chief clerk of the Census Office, wrote Congress on October 25, 1881, stating,", "While making these calculations I met with the so-called \"Alabama\" paradox where Alabama was allotted 8 Representatives out of a total of 299, receiving but 7 when the total became 300.", "Alabama's loss of its eighth seat when the House size was increased resulted from the vagaries of fractional remainders. With 299 seats, Alabama's quota was 7.646 seats. It was allocated eight seats based on this quota, but it was on the dividing point. When a House size of 300 was used, Alabama's quota increased to 7.671, but Illinois and Texas now had larger fractional remainders than Alabama. Accordingly, each received an additional seat in the allotment of fractional remainders, but since the House had increased in size by only one seat, Alabama lost the seat it had received in the allotment by fractional remainders for 299 seats. This property of the Hamilton-Vinton method eventually led to a change in the formula in 1911.", "One could argue that the \"Alabama paradox\" should not be an important consideration in apportionments, since the House size was fixed in size at 435, but the Hamilton-Vinton method is subject to other anomalies. Hamilton-Vinton is also subject to the \"population paradox\" and the \"new states paradox .\"", "The population paradox occurs when a state that grows at a greater percentage rate than another has to give up a seat to the slower growing state. The new states paradox works in much the same way\u2014at the next apportionment after a new state enters the Union, any increase in House size caused by the additional seats for the new state may result in seat shifts among states that otherwise would not have happened. Finding a formula that avoided the paradoxes was a goal when Congress adopted a rounding, rather than a ranking, method when the apportionment law was changed in 1911.", " Table 1 illustrates how a Hamilton-Vinton apportionment would be done by ranking the fractional remainders of the state's quotas in order from largest to smallest and compares it with simple rounding. In 2011, Minnesota's and Rhode Island's fractional remainders of less than 0.5 would be rounded up by the Hamilton-Vinton method in order for the House to have totaled 435 Representatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rounding Methods", "paragraphs": ["The kinds of calculations required by the Hamilton-Vinton method are paralleled, in their essentials, in all the alternative methods that are most frequently discussed\u2014but fractional remainders are rounded instead of ranked. First, the total apportionment population (the residential population of the 50 states plus the overseas military and federal employees and their dependents as determined by the census) is divided by 435, or the size of the House. This calculation yields the national \"ideal\" district size. Second, the \"ideal\" district size is used as a common divisor for the population of each state, yielding what are called the states' quotas of Representatives. Because the quotas still contain fractional remainders, each method then obtains its final apportionment by rounding its allotments either up or down to the nearest whole number according to certain rules.", "The operational difference between the methods lies in how each defines the rounding point for the fractional remainders in the allotments\u2014that is, the point at which the fractions rounded down are separated from those rounded up. Each of the rounding methods defines its rounding point in terms of some mathematical quantity. Above this specified figure, all fractional remainders are automatically rounded up; those below are rounded down.", "For a given common divisor, therefore, each rounding method yields a set number of seats. If using national \"ideal\" district size as the common divisor results in 435 seats being allocated, no further adjustment of the divisor is necessary. But if too many or too few seats are apportioned, the common divisor (i.e., the \"ideal congressional district size\") must be adjusted until a value is found that yields the desired number of seats. (These methods will, as a result, generate allocations before rounding that differ from the states' quotas.) If too many seats are apportioned, a larger divisor is tried (the divisor slides up); if too few, a smaller divisor (it slides down). The divisor finally used is that which apportions a number of seats equal to the desired size of the House.", "The rounding methods most often mentioned (although there could be many more) are Webster (\"major fractions\"); Hill (\"equal proportions\"\u2014the current method); Dean (\"harmonic mean\"); Adams (\"smallest divisors\"); and Jefferson (\"greatest divisors\"). Under any of these methods, the Census Bureau would construct a priority list of claims to representation in the House. The key difference among these methods is in the rule by which the rounding point is set\u2014that is, the rule that determines what fractional remainders result in a state being rounded up, rather than down.", "In the Adams, Webster, and Jefferson methods, the rounding points used are the same for a state of any size. In the Dean and Hill methods, on the other hand, the rounding point varies with the number of seats assigned to the state; it rises as the state's population increases. With these two methods, in other words, smaller (less populous) states will have their apportionments rounded up to yield an extra seat for smaller fractional remainders than will larger states. This property, arguably, provides the intuitive basis for challenging the Dean and Hill methods as favoring small (less populous) states at the expense of the large (more populous) states.", "These differences among the rounding methods are illustrated in Figure 1 . The \"black dots\" in Figure 1 indicate the points that a state's fractional remainder must exceed for it to receive a second seat, and to receive a 21 st seat. Figure 1 visually illustrates that the only rounding points that change their relative positions are those for Dean and Hill. Using the rounding points for a second seat as the example, the Adams method awards a second seat for any fractional remainder above one. Dean awards the second seat for any fractional remainder above 1.33 (the harmonic mean between 1 and 2). Similarly, Hill gives a second seat for every fraction exceeding 1.41 (the geometric mean between 1 and 2), Webster, 1.5 (the arithmetic mean between 1 and 2), and Jefferson does not give a second seat until its integer value of a state's quotient equals or exceeds two."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Webster: Rounding at the Midpoint (.5)", "paragraphs": ["The easiest rounding method to describe is the Webster (\"major fractions\") method which allocates seats by rounding up to the next seat when a state has a remainder of .5 and above.

These pair-wise tests, however, are not the only means by which different methods of apportionment can be tested against various criteria of fairness.", "For example, it is indisputable that, as the state of Montana contended in 1992, the Dean method minimizes absolute differences in state average district populations in the pair-wise test. One of the federal government's counter arguments, however, was that the Dean method does not minimize such differences when all states are considered simultaneously.

This measure is a useful way of summarizing the degree to which individual values in a list vary from the average (mean) of all the values in the list. High variances indicate that the values vary greatly; low variances mean the values are similar. If all values in the lists are identical, the variance is zero. According to this test, in other words, the smaller the variance is, the more equitable the method of apportionment.", "If the variance for a Dean apportionment is compared to that of a Hill apportionment in 2010 (using the difference between district sizes as the criterion), the apportionment variance under Hill's method is smaller than that under Dean's (see Table 4 ). In fact, using average district size as the criterion and variance as the test, the variance under both the Hill method and the Hamilton-Vinton method are the smallest of any of the apportionment methods discussed in this report.", "Variances can be calculated, however, not only for differences in average district size, but for each of the criteria of fairness used in pair-wise tests in the 1929 NAS report. As with those pair-wise tests, different apportionment methods are evaluated as most equitable, depending on which measure the variance is calculated. For example, if the criterion used for comparison is the individual share of a Representative, the Webster method proves most effective in minimizing inequality, as measured by variance.", "The federal government in the Massachusetts case also presented another argument to challenge the basis for both the Montana and Massachusetts claims that the Hill method is unconstitutional. It contended that percent difference calculations are fairer than absolute differences, because absolute differences are not influenced by whether they are positive or negative in direction.", "Tests other than pair- wise comparisons and variance can also be applied. For example, Table 4 , using 2010 Census apportionment population values, reports figures for each method using the sum of the absolute values (rather than the squares) of the differences between national averages and state figures. Using this test for state differences from the national \"ideal\" both for district sizes and for shares of a Representative, the Hill and Hamilton-Vinton method produce the smallest national totals for deviations from the average district size. The Webster method, on the other hand, minimizes the deviations for shares of a Representative."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fairness and Quota", "paragraphs": ["These examples, in which different methods best satisfy differing tests of a variety of criteria for evaluation, serve to illustrate further the point made earlier, that no single method of apportionment need be unambiguously the most equitable by all measures. Each apportionment method discussed in this report has a \"rational\" basis, and for each, there is at least one test according to which it is the most equitable. The question of how the concept of fairness can best be defined, in the context of evaluating an apportionment formula, remains open.", "Another approach to this question begins from the observation that, if representation were to be apportioned among the states truly according to population, the fractional remainders would be treated as fractions rather than rounded. Each state would be assigned its exact quota of seats, derived by dividing the national \"ideal\" size district into the state's apportionment population. There would be no \"fractional Representatives,\" just fractional votes based on the states' quotas."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Quota Representation", "paragraphs": ["Congress could weight each Representative's vote to account for how much his or her constituents were either over or under represented in the House. In this way, the states' exact quotas would be represented, but each Representative's vote would count differently. (This might be an easier solution than trying to apportion seats so they crossed state lines, but it would, however, raise other problems relating to potential inequalities of influence among individual Representatives. )", "If this \"quota representation\" defines absolute fairness, then the concept of the quota, rather than some statistical test, can be used as the basis of a simple concept for judging the relative fairness of apportionment methods: a method should never make a seat allocation that differs from a state's exact quota by more than one seat. Unfortunately, this concept is complicated in its application by the constitutional requirement that each state must get one seat regardless of population size. Hence, some modification of the quota concept is needed to account for this requirement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fair Share", "paragraphs": ["One solution is the concept of \"fair share,\" which accounts for entitlements to less than one seat by eliminating them from the calculation of quota. After all, if the Constitution awards a seat for a fraction of less than one, then, by definition, that is the state's fair share of seats.", "To illustrate, consider a hypothetical country with four states having populations 580, 268, 102, and 50 (thousand) and a House of 10 seats to apportion. Then the quotas are 5.80, 2.68, 1.02 and .50. But if each state is entitled to at least one whole seat, then the fair share of the smallest state is 1 exactly. This leaves 9 seats to be divided among the rest. Their quotas of 9 seats are 5.49, 2.54, and .97. Now the last of these is entitled to 1 seat, so its fair share is 1 exactly, leaving 8 seats for the rest. Their quotas of 8 are 5.47 and 2.53. Since these are both greater than 1, they represent the exact fractional representation that these two states are entitled to; i.e. they are the fair shares .", "Having accounted for the definitional problem of the constitutional minimum of one seat, the revised measure is not the exact quota, but the states' fair shares. Which method meets the goal of not deviating by more than one seat from a state's fair share? No rounding method meets this test under all circumstances. Of the methods described in this report, only the Hamilton-Vinton method always stays within one seat of a state's fair share. Some rounding methods are better than others in this respect. Both the Adams and Jefferson methods nearly always produce examples of states that get more than one seat above or below their fair shares. Through experimentation we learn that the Dean method tends to violate this concept approximately one percent of the time, while Webster and Hill violate it much less than one percent of the time."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Implementing the \"Great Compromise\"", "paragraphs": ["The framers of the Constitution (as noted earlier) created a bicameral Congress in which representation for the states was equal in the Senate and apportioned by population in the House. In the House, the principal means of apportionment is by population, but each state is entitled to one Representative regardless of its population level. Given historians' understanding that the \"great compromise\" was struck, in part, in order to balance the interests of the smaller states with those of the larger ones, how well do the various methods of apportionment contribute to this end?", "If it is posited that the combination of factors favoring the influence of small states encompassed in the great compromise (equal representation in the Senate, and a one seat minimum in the House) unduly advantages the small states, then compensatory influence could be provided to the large states in an apportionment formula. This approach would suggest the adoption of the Jefferson method because it significantly favors large states.", "If it is posited that the influence of the small states is overshadowed by the larger ones (perhaps because the dynamics of the electoral college focus the attention of presidential candidates on larger states, or the increasing number of one-Representative states\u2014from five to seven since 1910), there are several methods that could reduce the perceived imbalance. The Adams method favors small states in the extreme, Dean much less so, and Hill to a small degree.", "If it is posited that an apportionment method should be neutral in its application to the states, two methods may meet this requirement.
