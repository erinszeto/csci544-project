DOI agencies funded in the Interior bill that carry out this mission include the following: ", "The Bureau of Land Management administers about 245 million acres of public land, mostly in the West, for diverse uses such as energy and mineral development, livestock grazing, recreation, and preservation. The agency is also responsible for about 700 million acres of federal subsurface mineral estate throughout the nation and supervises the mineral operations on about 56 million acres of Indian Trust lands. The Fish and Wildlife Service administers the National Wildlife Refuge System, consisting of 89 million acres of federal land, of which 77 million acres (86%) are in Alaska. It also manages several large marine refuges and marine national monuments, sometimes jointly with other federal agencies. It is the primary agency responsible for implementing the Endangered Species Act (through listing of species; consulting with other federal agencies; collaborating with private entities and state, tribal, and local governments; and through other measures), promoting wildlife habitat, enforcing federal wildlife laws, supporting wildlife and ecosystem science, conserving migratory birds, administering grants to aid state fish and wildlife programs, and coordinating with state, international, and other federal agencies on fish and wildlife issues. The National Park Service administers the National Park System\u2014407 diverse units covering 85 million acres in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories. Roughly two-thirds of the system's lands are in Alaska. The National Park Service has a dual mission\u2014to preserve unique resources and to provide for their enjoyment by the public. The agency also supports and promotes some resource conservation activities outside the Park System through grant and technical assistance programs and cooperation with partners. The U.S. Geological Survey is a science agency that provides physical and biological information related to geological resources, climate change, and energy, mineral, water, and biological sciences and resources. In addition, it is the federal government's principal civilian mapping agency and a primary source of data on the quality of the nation's water resources. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management manages development of the nation's offshore conventional and renewable energy resources in the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Arctic. These resources are in areas covering approximately 1.7 billion acres located beyond state waters, mostly in the Alaska region (more than 1 billion acres) but also off all coastal states. The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement provides regulatory and safety oversight for resource development in the Outer Continental Shelf. Among its responsibilities are oil and gas permitting, facility inspections, environmental compliance, and oil spill response planning. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement works with states and tribes to reclaim abandoned coal mines. The agency also regulates active coal mines to minimize environmental impacts during mining and to reclaim affected lands and waters after mining. Indian Affairs provides and funds a variety of services to federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native Tribes and their members and historically has been the lead agency in federal dealings with tribes. The Bureau of Indian Affairs is responsible for programs that include government operations, courts, law enforcement, fire protection, social programs, roads, economic development, employment assistance, housing repair, irrigation, dams, Indian rights protection, implementation of land and water settlements, and management of trust assets (real estate and natural resources).

The Indian Health Service in the Department of Health and Human Services provides medical and environmental health services for more than 2 million American Indians and Alaska Natives. Health care is provided through a system of facilities and programs operated by the agency, tribes and tribal organizations, and urban Indian organizations. As of January 2015, the agency operated 28 hospitals, 62 health centers, and 25 health stations. Tribes and tribal organizations, through Indian Health Service contracts and compacts, operated another 18 hospitals, 282 health centers, 80 health stations, and 150 Alaska Native village clinics. Urban Indian organizations operated 33 ambulatory or referral programs. The Smithsonian Institution is a museum and research complex consisting of 19 museums and galleries, the National Zoo, and nine research facilities throughout the United States and around the world. Almost 27 million people visited Smithsonian facilities in 2014. Established by federal legislation in 1846 with the acceptance of a trust donation by the institution's namesake benefactor, the Smithsonian is funded by both federal appropriations and a private trust, with nearly $1.36 billion in total revenue from all sources of funding for FY2014. The National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities make up the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities. The National Endowment for the Arts is a major federal source of support for all arts disciplines. Since 1965 it has awarded more than 145,000 grants that have been distributed to all states. The National Endowment for the Humanities generally supports grants for humanities education, research, preservation, and public humanities programs; creation of regional humanities centers; and development of humanities programs under the jurisdiction of state humanities councils. Since 1965, it has awarded almost 63,000 grants. It also supports a Challenge Grant program to stimulate and match private donations in support of humanities institutions.

The $30.23 billion in H.R. 2822 as reported by the House Appropriations Committee for FY2016 was $3.09 billion (9.3%) less than the President's request of $33.32 billion for FY2016. H.R. 2822 recommended lower funding than sought by the President for many agencies, including the following: $1.17 billion (13.6%) lower for EPA, $736.7 million (12.7%) for the Forest Service, and $380.6 million (12.5%) for the National Park Service. However, for some agencies H.R. 2822 recommended the same or higher funding relative to the President's request. For instance, the House bill recommended $364.8 million (52.4%) more than the President for DOI Departmental Offices, largely due to funding for PILT included within this account (under Office of the Secretary). ", "The $31.13 billion in S. 1645 as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee for FY2016 was $2.19 billion (6.6%) less than the President's request. Like the House bill, S. 1645 also recommended lower funding than sought by the President for many agencies. Among the lower amounts were the following: $994.4 million (11.6%) less for EPA, $323.7 million (6.3%) less for the Indian Health Service, and $318.7 million (10.5%) less for the National Park Service. For other agencies, S. 1645 contained the same or higher funding relative to the President's request. For instance, the Senate bill proposed $197.5 million (3.4%) more than the President for the Forest Service, largely due to additional funding for the Wildland Fire Management account. ", "Unlike the President's request, the FY2016 House committee-reported bill did not include a cap adjustment for Wildland Fire Management. S. 1645 included bill language to provide for a new cap adjustment and also designated some of the funds in the bill for Wildland Fire Management as emergency funding."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
