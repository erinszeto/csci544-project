Small firms have also been celebrated as effective vehicles for advancing the economic status of minorities, immigrants, and women. ", "At the same time, some view the federal income tax as an obstacle to the formation and growth of small firms, while others see it as a policy tool for boosting their rates of formation and growth.

First, what is the appropriate definition of a small business in the context of public policy? Two considerations seem paramount in finding an answer to that question: (1) choosing the appropriate size measure (e.g., employment, assets, or receipts) and (2) determining whether that measure should apply to all small business tax benefits, as well as other forms of federal assistance for small businesses. ", "Second, is there a sound economic justification for supporting small firms? If no such rationale can be found, then government support for small businesses may do more harm than good by distorting the allocation of domestic economic resources. ", "Third, are tax benefits the most cost-effective way for the federal government to assist small firms? Small business tax preferences entail the following economic costs: (1) the foregone revenue and any interest charges from federal borrowing to offset that revenue loss, (2) the resources required to comply with the rules governing the use of the tax benefits and to enforce compliance with those rules, and (3) the opportunity cost of the foregone revenue and the resources devoted to tax compliance and enforcement. Other policy options for assisting small firms entail similar costs.", "This report is intended to shed light on the first two issues by identifying the main nonagricultural small business tax preferences, determining the foregone revenue associated with them, and examining the economic arguments for and against them. An assessment of the relative cost-effectiveness of existing federal small business tax benefits is beyond the scope of the report. The report begins by exploring the challenges associated with crafting a uniform definition of a small business for public policy purposes. It then describes existing small business tax preferences and reviews what is known about the economic contributions of small firms in general. It concludes with a discussion of the arguments for and against government policies to support small businesses.

And on the question of how to define a small firm for the purpose of federal programs to support small businesses, a necessary starting point is the Small Business Act of 1953 (P.L. 83-163, as amended). ", "Among other things, the act granted the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) the authority to establish size standards for federal programs supporting small businesses. A size standard specifies the maximum size a company can attain (whatever the measure) and still qualify for federal assistance. The act also gave the Administrator the authority to determine what those standards should be and how they should be applied. Since the act's passage, Congress has refrained from creating size standards for specific federal programs, with one exception: agricultural enterprises. Other federal agencies may create small business size standards for programs they administer, but they must gain the approval of the Administrator before the new standards can take effect.", "While empowering the SBA to select the size standards for federal programs, the act also laid down a basic consideration for identifying small businesses eligible for SBA programs. Paragraph 3(a)(1) stated that \"for the purposes of this Act, a small business concern.... shall be deemed to be one which is independently owned and operated and which is not dominant in its field of operation.\" ", "In the SBA's view, the act and its legislative history established that two principles should guide the agency in setting size standards for all industries. First, the standards should reflect critical differences among industries. Second, federal programs subject to the standards, including those administered by the SBA, should be designed to help eligible small firms improve their performance within the domestic economy. ", "For the programs it administers, the SBA has used three criteria to identify eligible firms since the early 1950s: (1) the average number of employees in the past year, (2) the average annual receipts in the previous three years, and (3) the value of assets. Employment and receipt size determine eligibility for the vast majority of industries listed in the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS). The choice of criterion hinges on an industry's structural features.", "The SBA has established three \"base\" (or \"anchor\") size standards, which shape its ongoing review of the standard it sets for a particular industry. For manufacturing, mining, and other industries with an employee-based standard, the base standard is 500 employees. For industries with a receipts-based standard, a group that includes most nonmanufacturing industries, the base standard is $7.0 million in average annual receipts. The base standard is 100 employees for firms involved in wholesale trade. For a limited number of industries, the SBA uses other measures of size that are appropriate for their main lines of business. For example, financial assets are used for banking, barrels per calendar-day for petroleum refining, and the share of overall power generation for electric utilities.", "In setting or revising a size standard for an industry, the SBA uses its anchor standard as the starting point. Whether a size standard is set below, at, or above that level depends on the results of an evaluation of certain industry characteristics, especially average firm size, start-up costs, entry barriers, degree of competition among firms, and distribution of firms by size. The SBA also takes into consideration the impact of a current or proposed size standard on the access of small firms to federal procurement contracts.", "According to the SBA's current table of small business size standards, standards based on receipt size range from $0.75 million to $35.5 million; those based on employment range from 100 to 1,500 employees; those based on financial assets are set at either $7 million or $175 million; those based on power generation are uniformly set at 4 million megawatt hours; and those based on petroleum refining are set at 1,500 employees and 125,000 barrels per calendar day. ", "The SBA does alter the size standard for particular industries from time to time. Before a proposed change can take effect, however, the agency's Office of Size Standards (OSS) is required to assess the likely impact of the change on the performance of the affected industry (or industries), focusing on the degree of competition, average firm size, start-up costs, barriers to entry, and distribution of industry sales and employment by firm size. OSS uses the results to make recommendations to SBA's Size Policy Board. If the board agrees with the recommendations, it typically advises the Administrator to approve the proposed change. Approved changes must be published in the Federal Register for public comment. The SBA issues no final rule until it has reviewed the comments received from the public, as well as any other new information.", "Under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-240 ), the SBA has the authority to set alternative size standards based on tangible net worth and average after-tax profits for the 7(a) and the 504/CDC loan programs it administers. Until the SBA does so, the act sets the tangible net worth limit at $15 million and the average after-tax profit limit at $5 million, excluding any net operating losses carried over from previous tax years, in the two fiscal years before the date of a company's loan application. The SBA has not established alternative size standards for those programs as of April 2018.", "The act also required the SBA to review at least one-third of NAICS industry size standards every 18 months and to make \"appropriate adjustments\" to reflect current market conditions. No later than 30 days after a review is completed, the SBA must file a report on its findings to the House Committee on Small Business and the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. It is also required to publicize its reasons for modifying or retaining each reviewed size standard.", "Federal agencies administering programs that reserve a share of procurement contracts for small firms (known as small business set-aside programs) are required to use the SBA size standards. Other federal programs and tax provisions supporting small businesses may use those standards, though they are not required to do so. Agencies are free to develop their own size standards, but they are subjected to a rigorous rulemaking review process overseen by the SBA before the new standards can be applied. An agency must get the approval of the SBA Administrator before a new standard may be used.", "The SBA's methodology for selecting size standards for industries continues to stir up concerns among interested lawmakers and analysts. Among the unresolved issues are the following:", "Should there be a fixed range for a size standard (e.g., 100 to 1,500 employees)? Should the standards be adjusted for inflation more often than once every five years? Should the employment standard be adjusted for productivity gains in an industry? Should the SBA lower its size standards for federal contracts in response to recommendations from the private sector? Should the size standards be calculated only in dollars to reflect actual structural differences among industries? "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How a Small Business Is Defined in the Federal Tax Code", "paragraphs": ["Does the federal tax code use the SBA size standards to determine eligibility for small business tax benefits? Yes, for the most part. ", "As Table 1 shows, most of these tax preferences use asset, receipt, or employment size to identify eligible firms. The employment and receipt sizes found in the tax code are much smaller than the sizes used by the SBA to identify small businesses by industry. In addition, a few tax provisions bestow their benefits on small firms not through a size standard but as a consequence of their design, most notably the expensing allowance under Section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). Although the statutory language of the provision makes it clear that firms of all sizes may claim the allowance, its limitations effectively confines its benefits to relatively small firms. ", "There is no explicit rationale in the tax code for the size standards that are used to establish eligibility for small business tax benefits. This lack of a uniform definition of a small business has at least one disadvantage and one advantage. On the one hand, the different IRC size standards can lead to an uneven and seemingly arbitrary distribution of tax benefits among companies that are similar in line of business and employment, receipt, or asset size. On the other hand, the absence of a uniform size standard gives lawmakers greater leeway in designing tax benefits to support specific policy objectives related to small businesses. "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Main Federal Tax Benefits for Small Business", "paragraphs": ["In principle, all business income is subject to federal taxation, but the reality is more complicated, as the federal tax code does not treat all business income equally.", "The tax burden on business income depends on several factors. One is whether or not a firm is organized for tax purposes as a C corporation or as a passthrough entity (i.e., partnerships (including limited liability companies, or LLCs), S corporations, and sole proprietorships). Corporate profits are taxed twice: once at the firm level and a second time at the shareholder level when any profits are distributed as dividends or long-term capital gains. By contrast, the net income of passthrough entities is taxed only at the owner or shareholder level.", "Furthermore, the taxation of business income depends on whether or not the owner of a passthrough entity pays the alternative minimum tax (AMT). Corporations were also subject to an AMT from 1987 to 2017; P.L. 115-97 repealed the tax, starting in 2018. Passthrough business owners paying the AMT may or may not be taxed at lower rates than they would be under the regular income tax. ", "Firm size also plays a role in determining a company's federal tax burden. Some tax provisions offer benefits to smaller firms that are not available to larger firms. There is no formal distinction between the taxation of small and large firms in the tax code. Rather, small business tax benefits are scattered throughout the sections of the code dealing with business taxation. Most come in the form of deductions, exclusions, exemptions, credits, deferrals, and preferential tax rates whose main effect is to reduce the cost of capital for investments and increase a firm's cash flow. ", "The federal tax benefits targeted at smaller firms with the broadest reach outside agriculture are discussed below. Excluded from the list are subsidies available only to small firms in particular industries, such as life insurance, banking, and energy production or distribution. Nor does the list include tax benefits that may be claimed by many small firms but are available to firms of all sizes, such as the Section 41 research tax credit and the Section 168(k) 100% expensing allowance. Table 1 summarizes the key features of each of these tax benefits.", "As a result of the enactment of H.R. 1 ( P.L. 115-97 ) in December 2017, the current lineup of small business tax benefits differs somewhat from the 2017 lineup. Under previous tax law, the graduated corporate income tax (whose rates ranged from 15% to 35%) was considered a small business tax benefit. P.L. 115-97 permanently replaced those rates with a single corporate tax rate of 21%, starting in 2018. The act repealed a second small business tax benefit from 2017: the rollover of gains from the sale of publicly traded securities into specialized small business investment companies under Section 1044. In addition, by repealing the corporate AMT, the act also did away with another small business tax benefit: an exemption under Section 55(e) from the AMT for corporations whose average annual gross receipts did not exceed $5 million in their first three tax years and $7.5 million in each succeeding three-year period.", "The current lineup makes no reference to the taxation of passthrough businesses. Some have argued that the tax rates that apply to this income should be considered a small business tax benefit when the returns to passthrough business investment are taxed at lower rates than the returns to corporate business investment. Such a difference existed under the tax law that was in effect in 2017. P.L. 115-97 reversed this difference by setting a corporate tax rate that is 8.6 percentage points lower than the top effective income tax rate for passthrough entities: 29.6%.", "There is another reason why it is inadvisable to regard the taxation of passthrough business income in general as a small business tax preference, regardless of the differences between corporate and noncorporate income tax rates. Among C corporations and passthrough entities, there are very small and very large companies, and they differ in their economic roles. According to data from the Internal Revenue Service, in 2014, for example, relatively small companies (those with $500,000 or less in receipts) accounted for 68% of C corporation tax returns, 70% of S corporation returns, 89% of partnership returns, and 98% of sole proprietorship returns. By contrast, relatively large companies (those with more than $50 million in receipts) represented 91% of total C corporation receipts, 40% of S corporation receipts, and 71% of partnership receipts in 2014; large firms made only a small contribution to total sole proprietorship receipts. These figures show that not all passthrough firms are small and not all C corporations are large, regardless of the size standard.", "It is not known how much revenue is lost because of tax benefits shown in Table 1 . Nevertheless, a recent estimate by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) indicates that their revenue cost could exceed $17 billion in FY2018 (see Table 1 ). To put this amount in the proper context, the budget for the SBA in FY2018 totals $887 million."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Expensing Allowance for Certain Depreciable Business Assets", "paragraphs": ["Expensing is the most accelerated form of depreciation. It treats the cost of acquiring a depreciable asset (e.g., a machine tool or building) as a current expense rather than a capital expense. As a result, the full cost of the asset is deducted in the year when it is placed into service. In the absence of expensing, companies have to recover capital costs over longer periods by using the appropriate depreciation method and schedule.", "Under IRC Section 179, a company may expense (or deduct) up to $1 million of the cost of qualified property\u2014mainly machinery, equipment, standardized computer software, and improvements to nonresidential buildings\u2014placed into service in 2018 and write off any remaining cost using the appropriate depreciation schedule under the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS). The maximum allowance is permanently fixed at $1 million and is indexed for inflation, starting in 2019. ", "Use of the allowance is subject to several limitations, the most important of which is the dollar limitation. Under this limitation, the maximum allowance is reduced (dollar for dollar) by the amount (if any) by which the aggregate cost of qualified property a firm places in service during a tax year exceeds a phaseout threshold. In 2018, the threshold is set at $2.5 million; it too is indexed for inflation starting in 2019. This means that a firm may expense as much as $1 million of its spending on qualified assets in the 2018, provided its total spending for this purpose during the year remains below $2.5 million. Once the firm's total spending surpasses that amount, the amount that can be expensed drops until total spending reaches $3.5 million, at which point none of that cost may be deducted under Section 179. ", "Congress established the expensing allowance mainly to serve two related purposes. One was to lower the cost of capital for relatively small companies. The other purpose was to stimulate increased business investment during periods of weak or negative economic growth. ", "There is no size limit on the companies that may avail themselves of Section 179. It is the phaseout threshold that makes the expensing allowance a benefit for small firms. Large firms such as GM, Microsoft, or Intel typically spend far more on assets that qualify for the allowance than the threshold for being ineligible for the allowance. ", "In theory, the allowance can stimulate business investment in two ways. First, it lowers the user cost of capital for investment in qualified assets, all other things being equal. This is because expensing produces a zero marginal effective tax rate on the returns to investment in those assets under the standard economic model for determining the user cost of capital. Second, the allowance increases the cash flow of firms using it, all other things being equal. For firms whose cost of internal funds is lower than their cost of external funds such as debt or equity, a rise in cash flow may be critical to their ability to undertake new investments.", "Economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin illustrated the impact of the allowance on the cost of capital in a 1995 article. Table 2 summarizes his results. The first column shows the corporate tax rate; the second gives the required pretax rate of return if the entire cost of the investment is expensed; the third column provides the required pretax rate of return if the entire cost is recovered through the depreciation deductions allowed under federal tax law in the early 1990s; and the final column presents the effective tax subsidy from expensing, which is expressed as the difference (in percentage points) between the required rates of return shown in columns two and three.", "At least two conclusions can be drawn from the results. First, expensing offered a significant investment subsidy that increased with a firm's marginal tax rate, as one would expect with a deduction. For example, at a tax rate of 15%, expensing lowered the user cost of capital by 11.3%; but at a rate of 35%, the reduction rose to 27.9%. Second, the user cost of capital under expensing declined as the tax rate increased because tax deductions were worth more at higher tax rates.", "In FY2018, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the allowance may produce a revenue loss of $50.4 billion (see Table 1 ). But the allowance does not necessarily produce a revenue loss. Its revenue effect generally hinges on the aggregate amount of U.S. investment in qualified assets in a particular tax year. In periods of rising business investment, the allowance is likely to generate substantial revenue losses because a share of the total cost of that investment is expensed. But the reverse is likely to happen in periods of declining investment, when the revenue gains from recent claims for the allowance exceed the revenue loss from new uses of it. Any shift from revenue loss to gain simply reflects the timing of depreciation deductions under current law. Firms that write off the entire cost of an asset in the year when it is placed in service under Section 179 can claim no additional depreciation allowances against future profits. In effect, they exchange a lower tax liability in the present for larger tax liabilities in the future. But companies making this tradeoff come out ahead, particularly in the case of relatively long-lived assets, since the present value of all depreciation deductions is greater with expensing than it is with less accelerated methods of depreciation. In other words, a company is better off with expensing than without it because one dollar of tax savings in the present is worth more than one dollar of tax savings in a future year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Amortization of Business Start-Up Costs", "paragraphs": ["A key concept underlying the federal income tax is that business taxable income should exclude all costs incurred in earning it. Consequently, companies are allowed to deduct as current expenses all ordinary and necessary costs paid or incurred in conducting a trade or business in determining their taxable income. The concept also implies that costs paid or incurred in starting or organizing a business should not be treated as current expenses, as they are not directly related to the generation of income. Rather, because these expenses are incurred in an attempt to create a capital asset (namely, the business) with a useful life that is likely to extend beyond a single tax year, they should be capitalized, added to the owner's basis in the business, and recovered when the business is sold or ceases to exist.", "IRC Section 195 (as amended by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 or AJCA, P.L. 108-357 ) deviates from this principle by permitting individuals who incur business start-up and organizational costs after October 22, 2004, to deduct up to $5,000 of those costs in the year when the new trade or business begins to operate. This deduction is reduced, dollar for dollar (but not below zero), by the amount by which eligible expenditures exceed $50,000. Expenditures that cannot be deducted may be amortized over 15 years, beginning in the first month the new trade or business earns income. In order to claim the $5,000 deduction, a taxpayer must have an equity interest in the trade or business and actively participate in its management.", "The Small Business Job Creation Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-240 ) raised the deduction to $10,000 and the phaseout threshold to $60,000 for qualified start-up and organizational expenses incurred or paid in 2010 only. These higher amounts have not been extended.", "To qualify for the deduction, start-up and organizational costs must meet two requirements. First, they must be paid or incurred as part of an investigation into creating or acquiring an active trade or business, as part of starting a new trade or business, or as part of an effort to produce income or profit before starting a trade or business with the aim of converting the effort into an active trade or business. Second, the costs must be similar in kind to costs that would be deductible if they were paid or incurred in connection with the expansion of an active trade or business in the same industry.", "Businesses that incurred or paid business start-up and organizational costs and then entered a trade or business on or before October 22, 2004, were allowed to amortize (or deduct in equal annual amounts) those expenditures over five or more years, beginning in the month when the new trade or business commenced.", "The option to deduct as much as $5,000 in business start-up and organizational costs in the first year of operation permits the owner of a new firm to deduct expenses in the year when the business begins. Without such a provision, the expenses could not be recovered until the owner sells his or her interest in the business or five years after the business started, whichever comes first. As a result, the option accelerates the recovery of certain business expenses, and this acceleration can aid the growth of small start-up firms by reducing their cost of capital and increasing their cash flow at a time when their access to financial capital may be restricted. For firms that lose money in their first year of operation, the deduction adds to their net operating losses, which may be carried forward up to 20 years and used to offset future taxes paid or owed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cash-Basis Accounting", "paragraphs": ["IRC Section 446 requires firms to compute their taxable income using the same method of accounting they regularly employ in keeping their books, as long as that method clearly reflects income for tax purposes.

Permissible methods of accounting include the cash-receipts method, the accrual method, the installment method, the long-term-contract method, the crop method, the special methods for research and development expenditures, and the method for soil and water conservation expenditures. ", "Two methods of financial accounting are widely used in the private sector: cash-basis and accrual-basis. Under the former, which is the preferred method for self-employed individuals, income generally is recorded when it is received in the form of cash or its equivalent, and expenses generally are recorded when they are paid, regardless of when the income is actually earned or the expenses are actually incurred.", "Under accrual-basis accounting, income and expenses generally are recorded when the transactions giving rise to them are completed or nearly completed, regardless of when cash or its equivalent is received or paid. More specifically, a firm using accrual-basis accounting records income when its right to receive it is established and records expenses when the amounts are fixed and its liability for them established.", "Each accounting method has its advantages. Cash-basis accounting is much simpler to administer and allows firms that employ it to control the timing of the recognition of items of income or deductions. In contrast, accrual-basis accounting often yields a more accurate measure of a firm's economic income because it matches income with expenses with greater precision and rigor.", "Under certain circumstances, the accrual method must be used for tax purposes. For instance, when keeping an inventory is necessary to the operation of a business, a taxpayer must use the accrual method in computing taxable income\u2014unless the IRS determines that another method clearly reflects income and may be used instead. Inventories are considered necessary when a firm earns income from the production, purchase, or sale of merchandise. In addition, C corporations, partnerships with C corporations as partners, trusts that earn unrelated business income, and authorized tax shelters generally are required to use the accrual method of accounting. ", "But there are some exceptions to these rules. Beginning in 2018, any partnership or C corporation with average annual gross receipts of $25 million or less in the three previous tax years may use the cash method of accounting. Individuals, S corporations, and qualifying partnerships and personal service corporations also have the option of using the method. This dollar threshold is indexed for inflation, starting in 2019.", "As these exceptions show, many of the eligible firms are relatively small in receipt size. In effect, the cash method offers the same benefit to small firms as the expensing allowance under Section 179 does: the deferral of income tax payments. The federal tax code operates in part on the principle that a firm receives income when it gains the legal right to be paid for something it has provided. But under the cash method, firms have greater control over the timing of receipts and payments for expenses than they do under the accrual method. As a result, firms using the cash method have the option of deferring the payment of taxes, or taking advantage of lower tax rates by shifting deductions and the recognition of income from one tax year to the next. ", "Despite the potential benefits to eligible small firms from using the cash method, it may not always be in their self-interest to do so. A case in point: a small business might be better off using accrual-basis accounting if it needs to periodically issue accurate and reliable financial reports. Cash-basis accounting can distort a firm's financial position in at least two ways. First, because it records transactions involving only cash or its equivalent, the method excludes transactions involving exchanges of assets or liabilities.

The method can be advantageous during periods when the cost of many inventory items is rising, since it yields a lower taxable income and inventory valuation than other methods. There are various ways to apply LIFO. A widely used application is known as the dollar-value method. Under it, a taxpayer accounts for the value of its inventories on the basis of a pool of dollars rather than a pool of specific items.

Small business tax preferences, however, weaken the link between tax liability and income by lowering the tax burden on the earnings of small firms, the vast share of which are organized as passthrough entities. The earnings of such a business pass through to the owner(s) and are taxed at his/her/their individual income tax rates. A substantial share of those earnings goes to individuals subject to the highest income tax rates. According to an estimate by the Tax Policy Center, passthrough business income represented 31.9% of total adjusted gross income (AGI) for taxpayers in the 39.6% tax bracket in 2017; for taxpayers subject to the 35% and 33% tax brackets, the AGI shares were 27.9% and 17.1%, respectively; the average share for all tax brackets was 8.8% in 2017.", "Among public finance economists, it is assumed that individuals, not firms, ultimately bear the burden of business income taxes or reap the benefits of business tax subsidies. Critics of government support for small business argue that these benefits ultimately increase the after-tax earnings of small firms. As a result, small business owners may have lower tax burdens than individuals whose taxable income comes primarily from wages and salaries. In this case, small business tax preferences may interfere with the achievement of horizontal equity in the taxation of household income. Horizontal equity involves taxing individuals with similar taxable incomes in the same manner. Differences in the taxation of key sources of income tend to undermine horizontal equity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Efficiency Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Some also oppose small business tax subsidies on efficiency grounds. In theory, income taxes reduce economic welfare by driving a wedge between the costs and benefits of the available choices for consumption and production facing consumers and firms, respectively. Standard economic analysis holds that the best possible tax system is one that raises needed revenue without distorting the allocation of economic resources among investment and consumption choices. The only tax that meets such a requirement is a lump-sum tax, since it would impose the same tax on all individuals, regardless of their income or wealth.", "Such a view has several notable implications for tax policy: ", "The returns to all investments should be taxed at the same rate; Any tax that is not uniform across businesses (regardless of size or organizational form) is likely to diminish social welfare; and Taxes should not distort a firm's choice of inputs or its investment or production decisions.", "Small business tax preferences, say critics, conflict with each of these principles. In their view, an efficient allocation of resources is possible only if the tax code is neutral with regard to business investments and the natural growth and decline of firms. A departure from the neutral taxation of capital income to assist small firms might be warranted if there were something uniquely or extraordinarily valuable about their economic role and if the majority of small firms can play that role only with government support. Proponents of such support contend that small firms, on the whole, demonstrate their unique value by consistently creating more jobs and generating more technological innovations than larger firms. They also claim that those contributions would be placed in jeopardy if the federal government were to stop supporting small firms.

They also argue that there is a lack of evidence to substantiate the claim that too few small firms are created over time owing to systematic failures by private lenders and investors to provide adequate financing for start-up firms.

According to the SBA, firms with 500 or fewer workers created 63.3% of all net new U.S. jobs from 1992 to 2013.", "But the two sides differ on the economic significance and policy implications of this contribution. On the one hand, proponents see the large share of net new jobs attributed to small firms as a reason for the federal government to support such firms. Critics, on the other hand, say that the share of net new jobs attributed to small firms does not prove what proponents claim it does. To back their case, they cite certain findings from the academic literature on firm size and job growth.", "According to critics, small firms are not consistently better at creating jobs than large firms. To substantiate this claim, they cite a 1994 study by David Birch and James Medoff of U.S. job creation. Birch and Medoff estimated that the share of the total number of net new jobs generated in the late 1980s and early 1990s by firms employing 100 or fewer workers varied from 40% to 140%, depending on the stage of the business cycle. ", "Critics also point out that there is substantial variation in the number of net new jobs small businesses create from one year to the next. Most jobs created by small firms originate in start-up firms, which typically begin small in employment size. According to a 2011 report by Ian Hathaway and Albert Palacios, firms in existence less than a year accounted for an average of about 3 million jobs per year from 1990 through 2009. By contrast, firms aged from 1 to 5 years lost an average of 622,000 jobs a year; firms aged from 6 to 10 years lost an average of 348,000 a year; and firms that had been in business 11 or more years lost an average of 574,000 a year. This is to say that non-start-up firms lost an average of 1.5 million jobs a year in that period. Hathaway and Palacios also found that the average annual job creation from 1990 to 2009 among start-up firms was 2.906 million, whereas small firms aged 1 to 5 years lost an annual average of 703,000 jobs; those aged from 6 to 10 years lost an annual average of 401,000; and those aged 11 or more years lost an annual average of 849,000. Relatively few start-up firms accounted for most of the job growth.", "A 2010 study by economist John Haltiwanger and Ron Jarmin and Javier Miranda from the U.S. Census Bureau supported the findings of the Hathaway-Palacios study. Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda used data from the Census Bureau Business Dynamics Statistics and Longitudinal Database to test the widely held belief that net job growth over time is negatively related to firm size. The results confirmed the belief when the researchers did not control for the age of firms. But when they did, the evidence for a systematic relationship between firm size and net job growth disappeared. What emerged instead was a systematic relationship between gross and net job creation and the age of firms. More specifically, the results showed that start-ups accounted for disproportionately large shares of job creation and job destruction from 1992 to 2005. They also indicated that firms over 10 years old and with more than 500 employees accounted for 40% of job creation and destruction. Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda concluded that young firms exhibit an \"up or out dynamic,\" meaning that they either grow fast or quickly go out of business. ", "Birch and Medoff discerned a similar trend in their analysis of the small business jobs created during the late 1980s and early 1990s. They called the few firms responsible for this job growth \"gazelles,\" as they grew swiftly from few employees to many employees. ", "Critics also contend that even if small firms were to create more lasting, well-paying jobs than large firms do over time, there would be no reason to expect government support for small business to generate faster employment growth. Economic analysis shows that an economy generates jobs through a natural process of growth, decline, and structural change. The size distribution of firms seems to be nothing more than a byproduct of this process. This implies that the level of national employment at any point in time is the result of a mix of forces that is bound to overwhelm the employment effects of any government support for small business. Most economists would agree that the key forces are fiscal and monetary policy, consumer spending, business investment, and U.S. exports and imports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Small Firms and Technological Innovation", "paragraphs": ["Research and development (R&D) is the lifeblood of technological innovation, which, in turn, serves as a powerful engine of long-term economic growth and transformation. Economists generally agree that without government support, business investment in R&D would fall significantly short of socially optimal amounts. Left to their own devices, firms are likely to invest too little in R&D for two reasons. First, they cannot capture all the returns to R&D investment, as other firms find ways to capitalize on the results of research despite patents and other forms of intellectual property protection. Second, some firms (mainly start-up firms) lack access to the funds needed to undertake planned R&D projects because potential lenders and investors lack the information they require to assess the projects' profit and the firms' survival potential. Economists generally view the predisposition of businesses to invest suboptimal amounts in R&D as a market failure. This is because the external economic benefits (or positive externalities) from the investments seem to have little or no influence on the investment decisions of private companies. To remedy this shortcoming, many economists call for the adoption of government measures aimed at spurring greater levels of business R&D investment than companies would undertake on their own.", "Critics of government support for small businesses maintain there is no good reason for targeting such support at small firms only if the main intent is to spark faster rates of technological innovation. They note that small and large firms develop the new technologies that propel economic growth and encourage lasting shifts in the structure of developed countries' economies. Moreover, say critics, it is often impossible to disentangle the contributions of smaller firms from larger ones. According to data from the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, larger firms typically perform the vast share of business R&D: in 2008 and 2009 combined, for example, companies with fewer than 500 employees accounted for more than 20% of the business R&D (measured in current dollars) conducted in the United States, whereas companies with 1,000 or more employees undertook nearly 76% of those investments.", "Available evidence indicates that small firms and large firms tend to have distinct advantages as agents of technological innovation. Historically, small firms have had more success than larger ones in using R&D to generate new industries and dominate the industries' early stages of growth. Smaller firms may also have been more flexible than larger firms in identifying and pursuing commercial applications for emerging innovations. In contrast, large firms more easily raise the funds needed to finance the sunken costs involved in many research projects. They are also likely to capture a larger share of the returns to R&D investments through marketing campaigns, the use of intellectual property protection, and the creation of regional, national, and international distribution, service, and repair networks.", "According to critics, studies that have looked at the effects of firm size and market structure on innovation have found no consistent proof that a certain firm size is ideal for generating and disseminating new commercial technologies. Rather, their findings indicated that in some industries, small firms were more innovative than large firms, but that in other industries, large firms had a decisive edge in the generation of new technologies.", "Critics also point out that the vast majority of U.S. small business owners have no intention of developing a new idea and bringing it to the marketplace. A 2011 study by economists Erik Hurst and Benjamin Pugsley from the University of Chicago noted that only 10% of new businesses that participated in a 2006 survey conducted as part of a Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics II reported that they planned to develop \"proprietary technology, processes, or procedures in the future.\" By contrast, nearly 80% of the businesses indicated that they had no plans for research and development \"to be a majority priority.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Small Firms and the Productivity and Efficiency of Business Supply Chains", "paragraphs": ["Critics of government support for small businesses also challenge the notion that small firms in general play critical roles in improving the efficiency of business supply chains.

Instead, their research showed that relatively few small firms bring new ideas to the marketplace, and that most small business owners are content to sell existing products or services to buyers in local established markets.

This disposition was consistent with the main characteristics of the industries in which the majority of small businesses operated: skilled craftsmen, lawyers, real estate agents, doctors, small shop owners, and restaurateurs. It is also consistent with another key finding by Hurst and Pugsley: for about half the people who started a new business in 2004, the primary motivations were nonpecuniary, especially being one's own boss and having flexible work hours.", "The findings from the two studies raise questions about the justification for current federal policy toward small businesses. Specifically, the findings suggest that most of the job growth and technological innovation by small firms is likely to come from the activities of a relatively small number of new companies. Therefore, Congress may consider whether new ways to target federal support at small start-up companies would help more of them raise financial capital.

A 2010 study by Alicia M. Robb and David T. Robinson of the financing choices of firms in their first year of business indicated that most of the firms in their sample relied much more on external debt than family and friends to obtain start-up capital.
