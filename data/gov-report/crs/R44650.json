In FY2015, approximately 82% of benefits were redeemed in supermarkets and superstores.

", "As noted above, SNAP's authorizing law defines \"staple foods\" as foods in the following categories: meat, poultry, or fish; bread or cereals; vegetables or fruits; and dairy products. The law further provides that staple foods \"do not include accessory food items, such as coffee, tea, cocoa, carbonated and uncarbonated drinks, candy, condiments, and spices.\" Under prior regulations, foods with multiple ingredients were counted in a staple food group based on the \"main ingredient\" as determined by USDA-FNS. For example, a box of macaroni and cheese might be classified as a variety within a staple food category but in the bread or cereal category (despite containing dairy). Prior regulation also defined perishable staple food items as \"items which are either frozen staple food items or fresh, unrefrigerated or refrigerated staple food items that will spoil or suffer significant deterioration in quality within 2-3 weeks.\" Regulation specified that a \"variety\" of qualifying foods in a particular category means different types of foods, not different brands, different nutrient values, different varieties of packaging, or different package sizes; the example was given that apples, cabbage, and tomatoes are varieties in the fruit or vegetable staple food category. ", "Although retailers must offer these particular types of foods to qualify as a SNAP-eligible retailer, SNAP participants may redeem their benefits for generally any foods for home preparation and consumption whether they are staple foods or not. SNAP benefits may not be redeemed for alcohol; tobacco; or hot, prepared foods intended for immediate consumption (e.g., a rotisserie chicken).

Namely, the law was amended to require stores to stock at least seven varieties of staple foods in each of the four staple food categories and to stock perishable foods in at least three categories.
