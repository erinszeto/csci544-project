At the time, the Dickey amendment halted the development of guidelines by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on the broad field of human embryo research and has each year since 1996 prohibited federal funding for human embryo research and related topics, including in vitro fertilization (IVF) and human embryonic stem cells. These cells have the ability to develop into virtually any cell in the body, and may have the potential to treat injuries as well as illnesses, such as diabetes and Parkinson's disease. Currently, most human embryonic stem cell lines used in research are derived from embryos produced via IVF. Because the process of removing these cells destroys the embryo, some individuals believe the derivation of stem cells from human embryos is ethically unacceptable.", "In August 2001, President George W. Bush announced that for the first time, federal funds would be used to support research on human embryonic stem cells. However, the Bush decision limited funding to research on 21 stem cell lines that had been created prior to the date of the August 2001 policy announcement. Scientists expressed concern about the quality and longevity of these 21 stem cell lines, believing that research advancement requires access to new human embryonic stem cell lines. However, those concerned about the ethical implications of deriving stem cells from human embryos argue that researchers should use alternatives, such as induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells or adult stem cells (from bone marrow or umbilical cord blood). In June 2007, President Bush signed an executive order directing the support of \"research on the isolation, derivation, production and testing of stem cells that are capable of producing all or almost all of the cell types of the developing body and may result in improved understanding of or treatments for diseases and other adverse health conditions, but are derived without creating a human embryo for research purposes or destroying, discarding, or subjecting to harm a human embryo or fetus.\" Many scientists continued to stress that research should focus on all types of stem cells, including those derived from human embryos.", "On March 9, 2009, President Barack Obama signed an executive order that reversed the nearly eight-year-old Bush Administration restriction on federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research and the June 2007 executive order. The Obama decision directed NIH to issue new guidelines for the conduct of embryonic stem cell research. Draft guidelines were released on April 23, 2009, and final guidelines were issued on July 6, 2009. In December 2009, NIH created a new registry of human embryonic stem cell lines that are eligible for use in research supported by federal funds under the 2009 guidelines. Shortly after the 2009 guidelines were issued, opponents of human embryonic stem cell research brought suit in federal court arguing that federal funding of such research was barred by the Dickey amendment. Specifically, the litigation turned on whether HHS could lawfully interpret the term \"research\" to include only activities performed once human embryonic stem cells had been isolated, or whether \"research\" must also include the antecedent embryonic stem cell derivation activities that generally resulted in the destruction of human embryos. Although federal funding of embryonic stem cell research was briefly enjoined, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected that argument and allowed federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research to continue under the 2009 guidelines. The Supreme Court has declined to review that decision, letting the D.C. Circuit's opinion stand. As of January 8, 2013, a total of 200 stem cell lines are listed in the NIH registry.", "Legislation introduced but not passed in the 111th and 112th Congresses would have codified the Obama stem cell policy, preventing reversal by future Administrations.

Animal embryos were the only source for research on embryonic stem cells until November 1998, when two groups of U.S. scientists announced the successful isolation of human embryonic stem cells. One group, at the University of Wisconsin, derived stem cells from five-day-old embryos produced via in vitro fertilization (IVF). The second group, at Johns Hopkins University, derived stem cells with very similar properties from five- to nine-week-old embryos or from fetuses obtained through elective abortion. ", "Both groups reported the human embryos or fetuses were donated for research following a process of informing one or more parents and obtaining their consent. The cells removed from embryos or fetuses were manipulated in the laboratory to create embryonic stem cell lines that may continue to divide for many months to years. The vast majority of research on human embryonic stem cells, both in the United States and overseas, utilizes cell lines derived via the University of Wisconsin method.", "Many religious and socially conservative individuals who are opposed to abortion are also opposed to research involving embryos. For these individuals, research involving human embryonic stem cells is of concern because the stem cells are located inside the embryo, and the process of removing the cells destroys the embryo. They believe the destruction of embryos for the purpose of harvesting embryonic stem cells is morally and ethically unacceptable and argue that researchers should use other alternatives, such as induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells or adult stem cells, both described below, instead of embryonic stem cells. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Induced Pluripotent Stem (iPS) Cells", "paragraphs": ["In 2006, Shinya Yamanaka and his colleagues at Kyoto University in Japan published a paper showing that the addition of four mouse genes into mouse skin cell lines could cause some of the cells to behave like embryonic stem cells. Earlier studies in mouse embryos by Yamanaka's group had identified genes that are active in early embryos; combinations of these genes were then used to try and reprogram adult mouse cells to act like embryonic stem cells. Until this development\u2014called induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells\u2014the characteristics displayed by the iPS cells were thought to occur only in cells found within the embryo. In 2012, Shinya Yamanaka was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work. ", "In November 2007, Yamanaka's group, and a second at the University of Wisconsin, announced a similar development in human cells through the introduction of four genes into human skin cells. The research teams accomplished the reprogramming of the adult skin cells by using a retrovirus to transport the four genes into the skin cells. The two teams each used a different set of four genes; the Kyoto group has subsequently achieved reprogramming using three genes. ", "Some who are opposed to human embryonic stem cell research argue that \"scientific reasons alone will now incline even the most willful researchers to leave the human embryo alone.\u2026 [The iPS technique] is so simple and powerful. The embryonic stem cell debate is over.\" Others, however, argue that although development of iPS cells may one day lessen the need to study stem cells derived from the human embryo, \"it would be premature\" to stop working with human embryonic stem cells for several reasons. For example, it is unclear whether iPS cells share all the characteristics of embryonic stem cells, and therefore multiple comparisons between the two types of cells will be necessary. In addition, because scientists have used potentially cancer-causing retroviruses to transfer the reprogramming genes, these iPS cells would not be desirable for therapeutic uses in patients. Therefore, alternative mechanisms to accomplish reprogramming would need to be developed. Scientists are in the process of investigating the use of other safer viruses to transfer the genes. Some groups are exploring chemical methods of achieving the same results by switching on genes in the adult cell rather than transferring in additional gene copies with a virus.

In SCNT the nucleus of an egg is removed and replaced by the nucleus from a mature body cell, such as a skin cell obtained from a patient. In 1996, scientists in Scotland used the SCNT procedure to produce Dolly the sheep, the first mammalian clone. When SCNT is used to create another individual, such as Dolly, the process is called reproductive cloning. In contrast, scientists interested in using SCNT to create cloned stem cells would allow the cell created via SCNT to develop for a few days, and then the stem cells would be removed for research. Creating stem cells using SCNT for research purposes is sometimes referred to as therapeutic cloning . Stem cells created via SCNT would be genetically identical to the patient, and thus would avoid any tissue rejection problems that could occur if the cells were transplanted into the patient. ", "Although various scientific groups have reported success in using SCNT to create cloned embryos (which are then used to produce stem cell lines or live births) of a variety of different mammals (sheep, rabbits, cows), attempts at creating primate embryos via SCNT had been unsuccessful. However, in June 2007, researchers at the Oregon National Primate Research Center at Oregon Health and Science University announced the successful derivation of stem cells from a rhesus monkey embryo created via SCNT. Results of the Oregon group were confirmed in November 2007.", "The unsubstantiated announcement by Clonaid in December 2002 of the birth of a cloned child contributed to the controversy over research on human embryos. In addition, charges of ethical and scientific misconduct clouded the reputation of scientists involved in deriving stem cells from human embryos created via SCNT. In February 2004, scientists at the Seoul National University (SNU) in South Korea announced the first isolation of stem cells from a cloned human embryo and in May 2005 announced advances in the efficiency of creating cloned human embryos and in isolating human stem cells. Concerns about the SNU work arose in November 2005 when a U.S. co-author of the 2005 paper accused Hwang Woo Suk, the lead SNU researcher, of ethical misconduct. In December 2005, a Korean co-author of the May 2005 paper stated that the research was fabricated and the paper should be retracted; Hwang agreed to the retraction.

Bone marrow is one source of hematopoietic stem cells\u2014cells that have the capacity to multiply and differentiate into all types of blood cells. Umbilical cord blood is another source of hematopoietic stem cells.

Others believe that adult stem cells should not be the sole target of research because of important scientific and technical limitations. Adult stem cells may not be as long lived or capable of as many cell divisions as embryonic stem cells. Also, adult stem cells may not be as versatile in developing into various types of tissue as embryonic stem cells, and the location and rarity of the cells in the body might rule out safe and easy access. For these reasons, many scientists argue that both adult and embryonic stem cells should be the subject of research, allowing for a comparison of their various capabilities.

Stem cells could be used to produce large amounts of one cell type to test new drugs for effectiveness and chemicals for toxicity. The damaging side effects of medical treatments might be repaired with stem cell treatment. For example, cancer chemotherapy destroys immune cells in patients, decreasing their ability to fight off a broad range of diseases; correcting this adverse effect would be a major advance. Stem cells might be transplanted into the body to treat disease (e.g., diabetes, Parkinson's disease) or injury (e.g., spinal cord).", "Before stem cells can be applied to human medical problems, substantial advances in basic cell biology and clinical technique would be required. In addition, very challenging regulatory decisions would be required on any individually created tissue-based therapies resulting from stem cell research that would need individual approval. Such decisions would likely be made by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The potential benefits would be likely only after many more years of research. Technical hurdles include developing the ability to control the differentiation of stem cells into a desired cell type (like a heart or nerve cell) and to ensure that uncontrolled development, such as cancer, does not occur with some stray cells. Experiments may involve the creation of a chimera, an organism that contains two or more genetically distinct cell types, from the same species or different species. If stem cells are to be used for transplantation, the problem of immune rejection must also be overcome. Some scientists think that the creation of many more embryonic stem cell lines will eventually account for all the various immunological types needed for use in tissue transplantation therapy. Others envision the eventual development of a \"universal donor\" type of stem cell tissue, analogous to a universal blood donor.", "However, if the method used to create iPS cells or if the SCNT technique was employed (using a cell nucleus from the patient), the stem cells created via these methods would be genetically identical to the patient, would presumably be recognized by the patient's immune system, and thus might avoid any tissue rejection problems that could occur in other stem cell therapeutic approaches.

The July 1978 birth in England of the first IVF baby, Louise Brown, aroused great public interest. As a result, HEW in September 1978 \"asked the Board to broaden its consideration of the pending application to include the scientific, ethical, legal, and social issues surrounding human IVF and embryo transfer in general. \" The EAB released its report on May 4, 1979, which found that IVF research was acceptable from an ethical standpoint and could be supported with federal funds.

Because no such Board has been appointed by the Secretary \u2026, no review of any application for in vitro fertilization has been allowed to go forward at NIH.

According to the White House, this would ensure that federal funds were used to support only stem cell research that is scientifically sound, legal, and ethical. Federal funds would not be used for (1) the derivation or use of stem cell lines derived from newly destroyed embryos, (2) the creation of any human embryos for research purposes, or (3) the cloning of human embryos for any purpose.", "NIH created a Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry listing the cell lines that met the eligibility criteria. The Bush policy and the NIH registry effectively replaced the August 2000 stem cell guidelines that were developed under the Clinton Administration and never fully implemented. Grant proposals for embryonic stem cell research underwent the normal peer-review process without the added review of the HPSCRG, as had been specified under the August 2000 stem cell guidelines. In February 2002, NIH announced the approval of the first expenditures for research on human embryonic stem cells.", "The NIH registry originally listed 78 human embryonic stem cell lines as eligible for use in federally funded research under the Bush policy. However, many of these stem cell lines were found to be either unavailable or unsuitable for research. Over time, a growing number of scientists, disease advocates and others became concerned that federally supported research on human embryonic stem cells was limited to 21 cell lines. Because these pre-August 2001 cell lines were developed using 1990s techniques, they were harder to work with and were genetically unstable compared to newer stem cell lines. In reaction to the limitations imposed by the Bush policy, several U.S. research groups decided to develop additional human embryonic stem cell lines using private funding or funds provided by state governments. ", "States responded to the Bush policy with initiatives to encourage or provide funding for stem cell research to prevent the relocation of scientists and biotechnology firms to other states or overseas. However, without the central direction and coordinated research approach that the federal government provides, others became concerned that the states' actions would result in duplication of research efforts, a lack of oversight for ethical concerns, and ultimately a loss of U.S. preeminence in this important area of basic research. Moreover, research groups studying human embryonic stem cell lines derived after August 2001were required to build new but duplicative laboratories, using funds that could have been spent on associated research, to ensure that absolutely no federal funds were used to support work on the newer stem cell lines. ", "In April 2004, over 200 House Members sent a letter to President George W. Bush requesting that the Administration revise the stem cell policy and utilize the excess embryos that are created during infertility treatment. The letter pointed out that an estimated 400,000 frozen IVF embryos \"will likely be destroyed if not donated, with informed consent of the couple, for research.\" According to the letter, \"scientists are reporting that it is increasingly difficult to attract new scientists to this area of research because of concerns that funding restrictions will keep this research from being successful.\" The letter went on to state that \"[w]e have already seen researchers move to countries like the United Kingdom, which have more supportive policies. In addition, leadership in this area of research has shifted to the United Kingdom, which sees this scientific area as the cornerstone of its biotech industry.\"", "In response, then NIH Director Elias A. Zerhouni wrote \"And although it is fair to say that from a purely scientific perspective more cell lines may well speed some areas of human embryonic stem cell research, the president's position is still predicated on his belief that taxpayer funds should not sanction or encourage further destruction of human embryos that have at least the potential for life.\" Some observers in 2004 believed this indicated a possible policy shift by conceding that science could benefit from additional stem cell lines and the president's position rested solely on ethical arguments. A June 4, 2004, letter signed by 58 Senators also urged President Bush to expand the federal stem cell policy, stating that \"despite the fact that U.S. scientists were the first to derive human embryonic stem cells, leadership in this area of research is shifting to other countries such as the United Kingdom, Singapore, South Korea and Australia.\" ", "On July 14, 2004, HHS announced that NIH would establish Centers of Excellence in Translational Stem Cell Research and a National Embryonic Stem Cell Bank. Then-Secretary Tommy Thompson stated that \"before anyone can successfully argue the stem cell policy should be broadened, we must first exhaust the potential of the stem cell lines made available with the policy.\" In reaction, the President of the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research stated that \"creating a bank to house stem cell lines created before August 2001 does nothing to increase the wholly inadequate supply of stem cell lines for research.\" ", "At a March 2007 Senate hearing, then NIH Director Zerhouni stated, in response to a question on the status of stem cell research, \"It's not possible for me to see how we can continue the momentum of science and research with the stem cell lines we have at NIH that can be funded.\" When asked about research alternatives, Zerhouni stated that \"the presentations about adult stem cells holding as much or more potential than embryonic stem cells, in my view, do not hold scientific water. I think they are overstated.\" He noted that overseas competitors were investing heavily in human embryonic stem cell research. \"I think it is important for us not to fight with one hand tied behind our back here.\u2026 I think it's time to move forward on this area. It's time for policy makers to find common ground, to make sure that NIH does not lose its historical leadership.... To sideline NIH on such an issue of importance in my view is shortsighted.\" These statements were notable at the time because they were divergent with Bush Administration policy.", "On June 20, 2007, President Bush signed Executive Order 13435 directing the support of \"research on the isolation, derivation, production and testing of stem cells that are capable of producing all or almost all of the cell types of the developing body and may result in improved understanding of or treatments for diseases and other adverse health conditions, but are derived without creating a human embryo for research purposes or destroying, discarding, or subjecting to harm a human embryo or fetus.\" However, many scientists continued to stress that research should focus on all types of stem cells, including those derived from human embryos."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Obama Administration Stem Cell Policy", "paragraphs": ["On March 9, 2009, President Barack Obama signed Executive Order 13505: \"Removing Barriers to Responsible Scientific Research Involving Human Stem Cells.\" The Obama executive order revoked the Bush presidential statement of August 9, 2001, as well as Executive Order 13435 signed by President Bush on June 20, 2007. The Obama executive order permits the Secretary of HHS through NIH to \"support and conduct responsible, scientifically worthy human stem cell research, including human embryonic stem cell research, to the extent permitted by law\" and directed NIH to review existing guidelines and \"issue new NIH guidance on such research\" within 120 days of the date of the executive order (see \" NIH Stem Cell Guidelines and Funding for Stem Cell Research \").

Although federal funding of embryonic stem cell research was briefly enjoined by a preliminary injunction between August 23 and September 9, 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ultimately held that the text and legislative history of the Dickey amendment sufficiently supported HHS's narrower construction of the term \"research\" and allowed federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research to continue under the 2009 guidelines. On January 7, 2013, the Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs' petition for review and let the D.C.

No payments, cash or in kind, were offered for the donated embryos. Policies and/or procedures were in place at the health care facility where the embryos were donated that neither consenting nor refusing to donate embryos for research would affect the quality of care provided to potential donor(s). There was a clear separation between the prospective donor(s)'s decision to create human embryos for reproductive purposes and the prospective donor(s)'s decision to donate human embryos for research purposes. Specifically (1) Decisions related to the creation of human embryos for reproductive purposes should have been made free from the influence of researchers proposing to derive or utilize human embryonic stem cells in research. The attending physician responsible for reproductive clinical care and the researcher deriving and/or proposing to utilize human embryonic stem cells should not have been the same person unless separation was not practicable. (2) At the time of donation, consent for that donation should have been obtained from the individual(s) who had sought reproductive treatment. That is, even if potential donor(s) had given prior indication of their intent to donate to research any embryos that remained after reproductive treatment, consent for the donation for research purposes should have been given at the time of the donation.
