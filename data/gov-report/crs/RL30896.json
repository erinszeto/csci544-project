Under the agreement, which was signed in July 2000 and requires Congressional approval, the United States pledged to extend conditional normal trade relations status to Vietnam, thereby significantly lowering tariffs on imports from Vietnam, in return for Hanoi's agreement to enact a wide range of market-oriented reforms. Congressional discussion over the BTA is expected to highlight Vietnam's labor rights situation, a topic that has become a contentious part of the trade debate in recent years. The BTA itself does not specifically address workers' rights.", "The evolution of Vietnam's labor rights regime has been heavily conditioned by the tension between maintaining political stability and promoting economic development\u2014two goals that often conflict. On the one hand, Vietnamese workers are not free to form their own independent unions. All unions must belong to the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor (VGCL), an organ of the Communist Party. Analysts have observed that the absence of a true right of association in Vietnam has impeded the improvement of labor rights in other areas. Collective bargaining agreements remain the exception rather than the rule. Vietnam's doi moi (renovation) economic reforms, launched in 1986, have been followed by surging urban unemployment and a rise in child labor, forced prostitution, and the trafficking of women and children. Workers in all sectors of the economy are often exposed to dangerous, unhealthy, and in some cases impoverished \"sweatshop\" conditions. Rapid economic expansion, corruption, and shortages of funds, training, and personnel have made it extremely difficult for government authorities to enforce Vietnam's labor laws.", "On the other hand, since the launch of the doi moi reforms, worker rights have made substantial progress. Vietnam rejoined the International Labor Organization (ILO) in 1992 and since then the government, unions, and local groups have intensified their cooperation with the ILO and other international groups. A comprehensive and detailed Labor Code was passed in 1994. Among other advances, it recognized workers' right to strike. There is evidence that over the past decade the VGCL and its member-unions have become more assertive\u2014particularly on matters relating to wages, health, and safety\u2014a development tolerated by the government. By many measures\u2014the coverage of labor laws, the tolerance of wildcat strikes, the slowly increasing clout of grass-roots unions, the relative openness of debate over labor issues\u2014there is evidence that the Vietnamese labor rights regime is more flexible and responsive than its Chinese counterpart.", "This report details Vietnam's law and policy in six areas of labor rights: the right of association/collective bargaining; forced labor; child labor; health and safety; wages, hours and welfare benefits; and discrimination.

The revisions are due to be debated in the National Assembly in April 2002. From what is known about the revisions, they are likely to help improve working conditions at the margin through such measures as streamlining Vietnam's cumbersome administrative procedures and expanding the country's social insurance system. Notably, the proposed revisions to collective bargaining requirements\u2014outlined below\u2014appear to signal the government's recognition that organizing at the grass-roots, enterprise level needs to be further encouraged and facilitated.", "However, by themselves the revisions are not likely to significantly help the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor (VGCL) establish its credibility in the rapidly expanding private and foreign-invested sectors. By law, all official unions will still be required to register with the VGCL. Many workers in these sectors see little benefit in joining the official umbrella labor organization, which traditionally has focused on providing social activities rather than pressuring employers for improved wages and working conditions. One result is that some workers have formed unofficial, ad hoc labor associations to push for better conditions in their workplace. Thus far, the government appears to have tolerated, and in some cases even encouraged, this development.

The committee's staff includes a representative from the National Assembly's Social Affairs Committee. The ILO and Western business groups\u2014principally the Ho Chi Minh branch of the law firm Baker, MacKenzie\u2014have also commented on drafts of the revisions. In June 2001, the drafting committee presented its revisions to the National Assembly, which is expected to begin debating the measures when it reconvenes in April 2002 for the first of its semi-annual sessions.", "A number of factors have motivated the Vietnamese government to initiate major labor law reforms. First, when the Labor Code was drafted in the early 1990s, the Vietnamese economy was largely a planned one dominated by state-owned enterprises. Now that the foreign-invested and private sectors together account for an estimated 50% of industrial output, the government has found it necessary to adapt its labor rights regime accordingly. In particular, Hanoi wishes to expand worker rights in\u2014and perhaps government oversight over\u2014the private sector, where an estimated 30% of employees are unionized. The proposed revisions to collective bargaining requirements\u2014outlined below\u2014appear to be a recognition that organizing at the grass-roots, enterprise level needs to be further encouraged and facilitated.", "Second, Vietnam has found it needs to bring many of its labor rules into compliance with the national treatment obligations of the newly-enacted U.S.-Vietnam bilateral trade agreement. Third, perhaps motivated by China's entry into the World Trade Organization, the government is attempting to attract more foreign direct investment by simplifying administrative procedures. For instance, the revisions eliminate the current requirement that foreign invested enterprises hire official employment services to recruit and hire Vietnamese nationals.", "Finally, in preparation for the gradual ending of the welfare role that state-owned enterprises traditionally have played, the government realizes the need to expand its social insurance program.

The actual number of these associations remains unknown, though the State Department puts their number in the \"hundreds.\" The VGCL and the government appear to be continuing to tolerate these groups' activities, perhaps because they are not perceived as a threat. For the first time, some high-level MoLISA officials are privately acknowledging the existence of unofficial worker associations.

The Vietnamese government reportedly has been reluctant to enter into negotiations, arguing that the two sides should not set quotas until the pattern of U.S.-Vietnam textile trade under MFN rates becomes apparent. The U.S. has significant leverage on the textile issue, however. Not only does Vietnam's textile industry\u2014which employs approximately 25% of the country's industrial workforce\u2014need access to the U.S. market, but also the U.S. could unilaterally impose quotas on Vietnam at any time because Hanoi is not a member of the WTO.", "Some Vietnam-watchers in the United States report that the Vietnamese government and textile officials are considering urging the country's textile and apparel manufacturers to obtain SA8000 certification to become more attractive to Western importers.

Those in favor of making this linkage argue that the failure of companies in developing countries to adhere to worker rights standards not only deprives workers of their basic human rights, but that it also places some American industries at a competitive disadvantage in trade, suppresses wages in the United States, and shifts employment opportunities to developing countries. Furthermore, many labor advocates contend that international trade agreements can encourage countries to relax their domestic labor laws in order to help their firms become more competitive.

News reports about labor activism are scarce, and the Vietnamese government has only recently begun to compile comprehensive information about labor conditions across the country. As the ILO has noted, one of the major problems in Vietnam is a lack of statistical and systematically collected information on labor relations. Correspondingly, the English information that exists is scarce, tends to be anecdotal, and tends to focus on conditions at factories owned by or linked to Western multinationals. In contrast to larger countries like China and India, Vietnam has slipped under the radar screen as far as country-wide studies of worker rights are concerned; the most comprehensive, up-to-date reports that are available are in the State Department's annual human rights report on Vietnam.

By the mid-1980s, disastrous economic conditions led the country to adopt a more pragmatic line, enshrined in the doi moi (renovation) economic reforms of 1986.

The move away from a command economy also helped reduce poverty levels from 58% of the population in 1992 to 37% in 1997.

Since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the private sector has also made impressive gains, to the point where privately owned firms employ nearly a quarter of the workforce. Most of the giant state-owned enterprises (SOEs), meanwhile, are functionally bankrupt, and require significant government subsidies and assistance to continue operating.

In subtle ways, however, the decision to prioritize economic development above ideological orthodoxy has led the Party to slowly loosen its former stranglehold on political power. Recognizing that Party cadres often were ill-suited to administering its own policy directives, for instance, the Party created a more powerful and professionalized executive branch in the 1992 constitution.

The latter fears that economic reform will lead to the loss of government control over the economic means of production and financial and monetary levers; they also fear the possible infiltration of heterodox outside ideas.

Many of those laws have been poorly drafted; they have already been amended several times because of their incompleteness or lack of enforcement provisions.

The spread of collective bargaining practices is in the beginning stages, and the government readily acknowledges that greater enforcement and speedier procedures are needed. The number and intensity of strikes, which are permitted under the law, is on the rise. Although the majority of these walkouts have been spontaneous outbursts and have not followed the bargaining process spelled out in the Labor Code, in most cases the government retroactively has supported the labor walkouts. Despite this progress, VGCL officials acknowledge that, in the words of one official, \"the operations of grass-roots trade unions have proved very weak in negotiating between employers and employees.\" Some analysts have pointed out that the absence of the true right of association in Vietnam has prevented speedier improvements in other areas of worker rights such as in health and safety issues.", "Article 7 (2) of the Labor Code reconfirms workers' constitutional right to organize and join unions or to participate in union activities, as long as these activities are legal and are carried out in accordance with provisions of the 1990 Law on Trade Unions (LTU).

Dispute settlement procedures are similar to those of Vietnam\u2014mediation, arbitration, and filing of a lawsuit in a People's Court (Labor Law, articles 77-83)\u2014but as one scholar points out, \"collective contracts are relatively meaningless without the right to take collective action.\" As in Vietnam, most Chinese workers enter into individual contracts with their employers. Chinese laborers' bargaining powers are limited by unemployment pressures, inadequate enforcement of existing laws, and Chinese government policies that forbid the formation of autonomous labor unions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Health and Safety", "paragraphs": ["China's Labor Law states that employers must implement State standards for occupational health and safety, educate laborers about occupational health and safety, and prevent accidents in the work process and lessen occupational hazards (article 52). Other provisions require employers to meet standards for health and safety facilities, to provide regular health exams for laborers engaged in hazardous work, and to give workers training for specialized operations (articles 53-55). For their part, laborers must abide by rules on safe operations. If compelled to operate under unsafe conditions, they may refuse to do the work, and report or bring charges against the endangering acts (article 56). By law, trade unions are to play a role in monitoring health and safety conditions (articles 23, 24). Chinese labor regulations contain provisions on workers' compensation for work-related accidents and diseases, and a national law on occupational diseases is expected to be enacted by the end of 2001. However, these regulations are poorly enforced, and the Chinese government has publicized the problem and worked with the ILO to train health and safety officers and to educate local officials. According to official statistics, the number of industrial accidents has declined in recent years. In 1999, several U.S. corporations, many of whom subcontract assembly work to Hong Kong, Taiwanese, and South Korean companies, jointly developed a \"Code of Conduct\" by which to promote international labor standards in these factories.

Beijing does not set a uniform minimum wage, but lets local governments determine their own minimum wage standards. China's per capita income is about two to four times that of Vietnam's ($800 in nominal terms; $4,000 in purchasing power parity terms). The State Department reports that these wages are \"usually sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family.\" In some larger cities, the minimum wage for factory workers is about $38 per month, roughly the same as minimum wage levels in Vietnam. However, according to one study, average wages for workers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen range from $175 to $300 per month. According to another study by a U.S.-China trade group, wages at U.S. factories in China were, on average, more than twice as high as wages for comparable jobs at Chinese state-owned enterprises.", "China's Labor Law has rules on work hours and vacation time, but they are not as detailed as those in the Vietnamese Labor Code. In 1995, China reduced the standard workweek from 44 hours to 40 hours\u2014excluding overtime\u2014eight fewer hours than Vietnam's general standard. The Labor Law mandates a 24-hour rest period weekly for staff and workers (article 38), apparently a broader provision than that in the Vietnamese Labor Code. As in Vietnam, overtime pay is required for extended work hours, which generally are not to exceed one hour per day and which are to be agreed upon by the employer in consultation with the trade union and laborers (article 41). A system of paid annual vacation time is also practiced in China with specific measures formulated by the State Council (article 45). Holidays are not covered under the law, but under separate measures; in spring 2000, the number of paid holidays was increased from 7 to 10 days a year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Forced Labor", "paragraphs": ["The Chinese Labor Law stipulates criminal responsibility for persons who compel workers to operate against established rules and under unsafe conditions if major accidents and serious consequences result (article 93). Like the Vietnamese Labor Code, which prohibits ill treatment of workers, the PRC law prohibits employers from using violence, intimidation, or illegal restriction of personal freedom to compel laborers to work. Such acts are punishable by means of detention, a fine, or a warning; if they constitute a crime, criminal responsibility will be pursued (article 96, item 1).", "Unlike Vietnam, the PRC uses forced labor as a method of punishment for criminal and for socially disruptive actions. The former is referred to as \"reform through labor;\" the latter is termed \"labor reeducation.\" Labor reeducation in particular has been harshly criticized by Western governments, human rights organizations, and the United Nations. In 1992 and 1994, the United States and China signed memoranda of understanding on prohibiting export trade in prison labor products, but their implementation remains problematic; there have been many reports documenting the export of products in which some stages of assembly were subcontracted to prisoners, who received no payment.", "Generally speaking, Chinese law prescribes harsher punishments than those in Vietnamese law for crimes of trafficking in women and children. The PRC Criminal Law prescribes punishments for stealing babies or infants for the purpose of extorting money or property (not less than 10 years imprisonment plus fine or confiscation of property); for abducting and trafficking in women or children (between 5 and 10 years of imprisonment, plus fine or confiscation of property); and for buying an abducted woman or child (not more than three years, with exceptions). In especially serious cases, the first two types of crimes may incur the death penalty and confiscation of property. The Law of the PRC on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women also prohibits trafficking in women (article 36, paragraph 1). It further provides that the relevant government organs must take timely measures to rescue the victims, that the women should not be discriminated against if they return to their former place of residence, and that local government organs will settle any problems that may subsequently arise (article 36, paragraph 2)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Child Labor", "paragraphs": ["The Labor Law prohibits employers from recruiting minors under the age of 16 (article 15, paragraph 1), two years lower than the minimum employment age in Vietnam. Juvenile workers\u2014workers between the ages of 16 and 18\u2014are prohibited from performing certain types of physical labor. Until recently, the ILO and UNICEF maintained that there was not a significant child labor problem in China, particularly in the formal and export-oriented economic sectors. However, the decentralization and privatization of the economy has produced widening income gaps, a breakdown in social welfare services, and greater opportunities for crime and corruption. Stagnating rural incomes, rising fees for school, and family financial crises coupled with deteriorating social welfare systems have compelled some poor, rural parents to send their children to work.", "According to the State Department, the Chinese government publicly maintains that the country does not have a significant child labor problem, and unlike Vietnam has not initiated a program to study the national scope of illegal child labor. Nevertheless, underage labor (13-15 years of age) has been reported in small factories and mines in rural and other remote areas and in the cities where young teenagers work as car washers, garbage collectors, and street vendors. In March 2001, an explosion in an elementary school in rural Jiangxi province killed 37 children who reportedly had been forced by their teachers to manufacture firecrackers. Underage workers have reportedly used fake i.d.'s to work in some foreign-run factories in the coastal provinces. The ACFTU, the Chinese media, non-governmental organizations, and some Chinese lawyers have researched and publicized the problem and provided legal assistance to underage laborers. There have been isolated incidents of traffickers bribing local authorities and taking children from destitute parents by promising to find them work that will provide large remittances. It has been speculated that some child prostitutes in Thailand were trafficked from minority areas in southwestern China."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Explaining the Differences between Vietnam and China", "paragraphs": ["What factors account for the apparently stronger labor rights regime\u2014particularly the greater union independence and assertiveness\u2014in Vietnam vis \u00e0 vis China? The vast differences in physical and population size between the two countries has played a role. With less than a tenth of China's population, Vietnam may be more dependent on the outside world, both politically and economically. If so, Vietnamese leaders therefore are likely to be more sensitive to prevailing international norms regarding labor rights, which may explain why they have aggressively engaged the ILO and the U.S. Department of Labor in recent months.", "Despite sharing similar Leninist political structures, relations between labor and the state in Vietnam and China have followed different paths. Some analysts argue that Vietnam's union movement was strengthened by the country's division and its civil war. For over twenty years, Vietnam was divided into a communist north and a capitalist south, giving Vietnam a recent capitalist legacy and labor autonomy that China lacks. Strikes and other militant labor actions, for instance, were a frequent occurrence in the south. In the North, decades of war prevented the Communist Party from imposing the same degree of authoritarian control over the union movement compared with China. Additionally, for a variety of structural and historical reasons, the Vietnamese Communist Party does not seem to have been as authoritarian as its Chinese counterpart.", "Vietnam's experiment with economic reforms was enacted later and has been far less extensive than that in China. Beijing has had to deal with far more social disruption than has Hanoi, perhaps making China's leaders more sensitive to permitting union independence. For instance, Vietnamese leaders also have not confronted a regime-threatening political experience similar to the Tiananmen protest movement in the spring of 1989. In the months before the demonstrations, China's ACFTU at all levels had pushed for more autonomy from the Party. As part of its crackdown against the protests, the government squelched the ACFTU's assertiveness.", "However, although Vietnamese unions and laborers possess greater freedoms to advocate for workers and express grievances than their Chinese counterparts, progress in labor rights and conditions in Vietnam remains uncertain. Market-oriented reforms and foreign investment in Vietnam could lead to a greater emphasis on production, more official corruption, and heightened social unrest as they have in China, which may in turn undermine labor rights. Additionally, for all the differences between Vietnam and China, most rights and freedoms in both countries stem not from the law, but from the discretion of the Party. Despite the differences between the two countries, many labor freedoms and rights in Vietnam are still vulnerable to changes in state policy. Since Vietnam's Labor Code was adopted in 1994, it is still being implemented and interpreted."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion: Implications for the BTA", "paragraphs": ["The state of Vietnam's worker rights conditions has become part of the debate over whether Congress should approve the Vietnam-U.S. BTA, which does not contain provisions that explicitly deal with labor rights. The linkage between labor rights and the BTA would have become even more contentious if the Bush Administration had followed up on its proposal to bundle the BTA into a broad-based trade bill that would also include a U.S.-Jordan free trade agreement and new negotiating authority (also known as \"fast track\" or \"trade promotion authority\") for the President to negotiate new multilateral trade agreements. Workers' rights\u2014along with environmental conditions\u2014will likely be prominent in the debates over both the Jordan agreement and trade promotion authority. They are also likely to loom large in the debate over the merits of a bilateral textile agreement, which the U.S. and Vietnam are likely to negotiate in the next year.", "Many proponents of linking labor rights and trade agreements have argued that Congress should not pass the BTA until Vietnam's labor conditions improve further. Some labor rights advocates contend that globalization occasionally has weakened Vietnam's labor rights regime in the textile and apparel industries; at times, textile multinationals and industrialized governments have pushed the Vietnamese government\u2014against the wishes of the VGCL\u2014to relax its enforcement of certain provisions of the Labor Code.", "Other labor rights advocates argue that while Congress should pass the Vietnam-U.S. BTA, it should do so only after the signing of a textile and apparel agreement that includes conditions on labor rights along the lines of the provisions of the Cambodia-U.S. textile agreement. That agreement, which was signed in January 1999, is designed to reward improvements in labor rights with increased access to the U.S. textile and apparel market. The agreement establishes annual quota levels, which can be increased by up to 14% each year if the U.S. determines that worker rights in the Cambodian textile sector \"substantially comply\" with \"international recognized core labor standards\" and Cambodian labor laws.", "Opponents of linking the Vietnam-U.S. BTA to improvements in labor conditions contend that obtaining MFN status will indirectly help improve Vietnamese labor conditions. By promoting economic development, they argue, the BTA will provide Vietnamese workers with more opportunities, increased knowledge, and improved means to promote their rights. Foreign investment, which is likely to increase if the BTA is passed, is also thought by some to raise working conditions generally by bringing in multinational corporations that pay higher wages and have better health and safety conditions than do local enterprises. Finally, supporters of unconditional passage of the BTA argue that the agreement will improve labor rights by promoting the rule of law in Vietnam. For instance, they point out that the BTA requires Vietnam to publicize in advance most business-related laws and regulations, a move that should enhance the transparency of the country's legal regime."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
