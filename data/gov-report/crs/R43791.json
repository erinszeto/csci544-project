When prices for gasoline and diesel are relatively low or natural gas prices are relatively high, natural-gas-based fuels lose much of their price advantage. While natural gas has other benefits\u2014such as producing lower emissions than gasoline and diesel and protecting users of transportation fuels from the volatility of the international oil market\u2014it is largely the cost advantage, if any, that will determine the future attractiveness of natural gas vehicles.", "There are a number of technology pathways that could lead to greater use of natural gas in transportation. Some require pressurized systems to use natural gas in a gaseous state, and others convert natural gas to a liquid. Two of the most widely discussed options use compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Other technological approaches use liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), propane, and hydrogen. In addition, natural gas can be used to generate electricity to power electric vehicles.", "Increasing the use of natural gas to fuel vehicles would require creation of an extensive nationwide refueling infrastructure. Although a small number of CNG vehicles have been on U.S. roads for more than 20 years, CNG use has been limited to vehicles that return to a central garage for refueling each day, such as refuse trucks, short-haul trucks, and city buses. LNG, on the other hand, requires large insulated tanks to keep the liquefied gas at a very low temperature and is therefore seen as more suitable for long-haul trucks. In both cases, the limited availability of refueling stations has limited the distances and routes these vehicles may travel.", "Congress has taken a strong interest in spurring production and use of natural gas vehicles. Legislation has been introduced on a wide range of proposals that would equalize the tax treatment of LNG and diesel fuels, provide tax credits for natural gas vehicles and refueling equipment, require the production of vehicles that could run on several different fuels (such as gasoline and CNG), increase federal research and development on natural gas vehicle tank and fuel line technologies, and revise vehicle emission regulations to encourage manufacturers to produce more CNG passenger cars.", "Legislation pending in the 113th Congress includes proposals that would extend expired tax credits for refueling property and fuel cell vehicles (S. 2260), authorize the use of energy savings performance contracts to support the use of natural gas and electric vehicles (S. 761), and require the U.S. Postal Service to study the feasibility of using natural gas and propane in long-haul trucks (S. 1486)."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The discovery of new sources of domestic natural gas from shale has given rise to new interest in using natural gas more extensively in transportation.

Natural gas liquids such as propane and butane can also replace gasoline. As a petrochemical feedstock, methane can be used to produce synthetic diesel fuel and gasoline substitutes such as ethanol, methanol, and butanol. A reformation process can convert methane to hydrogen for fuel cell-powered vehicles. In addition, natural gas can be burned to generate electricity for charging electric vehicles.

Moreover, while oil prices are set in a global market, U.S. natural gas prices are largely determined domestically, and the discovery of large domestic reserves suggests that prices may remain relatively low. Environmental preference. Natural gas, while also a fossil fuel, generally produces lower emissions per vehicle mile than diesel and heavier oil. Energy diversity and security. Increased use of domestic natural gas for transportation may mean that less oil will be imported. The United States might be more insulated from global petroleum price volatility if more forms of transportation were based on natural gas. Growth potential. Only 2.9% of U.S, natural gas production is currently used in transportation, mainly to move gas through the pipelines, and expanded use of natural gas vehicles would likely lead to increased demand for natural gas.

", "Oil-based gasoline and diesel fuel continue to remain the fuels of choice in both the domestic and commercial transportation sectors. However, U.S. demand for finished petroleum products has fallen 12% from its all-time peak in 2005, due in part to greater use of natural gas for many purposes. Although natural gas consumption by vehicles grew 26% from 2008 through 2013, natural gas still represents less than 1% of the fuels used in the transportation sector. ", "Among the key factors determining the attractiveness of natural gas as a transportation fuel is its price relative to diesel fuel. The energy content of a given volume of natural gas in compressed or liquefied form differs from that of refined petroleum products. For example, one gallon of LNG has 82,644 British thermal units (Btu) of energy compared to 139,000 Btu per gallon of diesel fuel and 114,000 Btu per gallon of gasoline. Prices can be compared by converting natural gas to its gasoline gallon equivalent (GGE) or diesel gallon equivalent (DGE). Measured by Btus, a barrel of oil has historically cost several times as much as a comparable unit of natural gas ( Figure 2 ). U.S. natural gas prices fell by half between 2008 and 2014 as increasing supplies from shale formations became available.

In that state, it would not be able to function as a vehicle fuel. If natural gas is compressed to a pressure of 3,600 pounds per square inch (psi), however, it becomes suitable for use in a vehicle engine. As shown in Figure 3 , a CNG vehicle's fuel storage tank is mounted in the back of a vehicle and takes up about half of what is the trunk in a traditional vehicle. It contains about eight gasoline gallons equivalent, which give it a driving range of over 150 miles. ", "The CNG fuel system transfers the highly pressurized natural gas from the storage tank to the engine, reducing pressure during the transfer to equate to the operating pressure of the engine's fuel-management system. A CNG engine functions like a gasoline engine: The fuel and air mixture are compressed and then ignited by a spark plug, expanding gases to drive pistons to propel the vehicle. Certain changes are required to accommodate the pressurized, gaseous CNG, such as new valves and fuel injectors and a pressure regulator. While much of a natural gas vehicle's composition is similar to that of gasoline-powered internal combustion engine vehicle, modifications required for CNG use currently add up to $11,000 to the price of a passenger vehicle.", "Some current models of CNG vehicles are bifuel, with tanks for both CNG and gasoline, thereby allowing for extended driving range. When a bifuel vehicle runs out of CNG, it automatically shifts into gasoline mode. Drivers can also shift from one fuel to another by selecting a dashboard button. ", "In addition to passenger vehicles, CNG has been adopted as a fuel for taxis; regional-haul trucks used in local freight and package delivery; construction, residential refuse pickup, and municipal fleets; and transit buses. The vehicles return each day to a central garage or maintenance yard, where refueling infrastructure may be installed. In some cases, government subsidies have been required to make CNG competitive with diesel fuel. In September 2014, for example, the brewer Anheuser-Busch announced that it would replace 66 heavy-duty delivery trucks in Houston with CNG-powered vehicles after the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality approved a $45,000 grant for each vehicle. ", "There are about 150,000 CNG vehicles on the road today in the United States. About 88,000 are cars, SUVs, and vans, and the rest are commercial vehicles, refuse trucks, and buses. Among passenger vehicles, and in addition to the Honda Civic natural gas sedan and the Chevrolet Impala sedan, automakers offer bifuel Chevrolet Silverado and Sierra pickup trucks and a Chrysler Dodge Ram 2500 Dual Cab pickup truck.

It is preferred over CNG for long-haul trucking because it requires only 30% of the space to store the same amount of energy and has a higher energy density per unit of volume. Range is also important, as long-haul truck drivers seek to reduce down-time in refueling. According to trucking company J. B. Hunt Transport Services, a diesel tractor with:", "a 100-gallon diesel tank has a range of 640 miles, two 100-gallon LNG tanks (110 DGE) has a range of 605 miles, and four 25-gallon CNG tanks (100 DGE) has a range of 467 miles.

While about 80% of an LNG truck engine is similar to a diesel truck engine, LNG-related components add about $50,000 to the price of a truck that might otherwise sell for $150,000. According to truck manufacturer Freightliner, an LNG-fueled truck driven 50,000 miles per year could save $85,000 in annual fuel costs, recouping the additional capital cost of the vehicle in seven months.", "LNG is not ideal for passenger vehicles because of the large insulated tanks needed to keep the fuel cold. In addition, LNG is most effective when the vehicle it fuels is used regularly, such as long-haul trucks. When LNG is not being used on a regular basis, it is slowly heated by the surrounding temperatures and eventually escapes into the air. ", "There are 4,000-5,000 LNG trucks operating on U.S. highways. Fleet operators\u2014including Waste Management, United Parcel Service, and AT&T\u2014have shown an interest in LNG trucks. In some cases, they have installed conversion kits that enable trucks to run on either LNG or diesel, allowing owners to take advantage of changing prices. The market for truck fuel is large.

Because it is a liquid and has a high octane rating, it can also be utilized as motor vehicle fuel source in three ways: (1) directly in a vehicle or blended with gasoline; (2) converted into dimethyl ether (DME) as a diesel replacement, and (3) part of biodiesel production. Its main disadvantage is that methanol has low volumetric energy density: A gallon of methanol has about 49% of the Btus of a gallon of gasoline.", "The incremental cost of adding methanol capability to a passenger vehicle is under $200 per vehicle. This is normally done by installing an alcohol fuel sensor to monitor the fuel mixture and adjust fuel flow according to the ratio of methanol to gasoline, thereby creating a \"flex-fuel\" vehicle that can run on pure methanol, pure gasoline, or any combination of the two. No methanol flex-fuel vehicles are produced domestically at this time. When they were in production, manufacturers added larger fuel injectors and stainless steel fuel tanks and fuel lines, because methanol is highly corrosive and would deteriorate aluminum or other standard metal fuel line parts. ", "California experimented with use of methanol as a fuel from 1988 to 2004 and spurred the production of about 15,000 methanol vehicles, most of them flex-fuel cars.

It is known as autogas or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) when used as a motor vehicle fuel. Only a very small part of the propane manufactured each year is used for transportation. Stored in a vehicle tank pressurized to about 150 pounds per square inch, it becomes a liquid with an energy density 270 times greater than the gaseous form. Because its Btu rating is lower than gasoline, it takes more fuel to drive the same distance. As with CNG, vehicles are produced as dedicated propane or bifuel, with separate fueling systems permitting use of either propane or gasoline. General Motors offers the only light-duty propane vehicles now on the market, the Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana vans.

When liquefied under pressure, it has properties similar to propane. It can also be used as a replacement fuel in diesel trucks. China accounts for about 90% of global DME consumption, using it for residential heating and cooking but also increasingly as a truck and bus fuel. A privately funded U.S. pilot program for trucks is underway. Using gas-to-liquids technology (GTL), natural gas can be converted into synthetic base oil with fewer impurities than petroleum, resulting in less wear of equipment and greater fuel efficiency. GTL products can be used as replacements for motor oil and diesel fuel (or blended with it). Royal Dutch Shell operates two GTL plants outside the United States, and other companies are studying the feasibility of constructing GTL plants on the U.S Gulf Coast. There are no known plans to use GTL to fuel motor vehicles in the United States, but Shell has announced that it will use the technology to create lower-viscosity engine oils to improve fuel economy. GTL-based lubricants are used in some U.S. light vehicles. Hydrogen, produced mainly from natural gas, can be used to power fuel cell vehicles. This process relies on the existing natural gas supply and pipeline network: 95% of the hydrogen produced in the United States is made this way in 73 plants. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles have been under development for well over a decade, with substantial research and development by automakers and the Department of Energy (DOE) to find a competitively priced vehicle technology. Methods of making hydrogen from natural gas currently result in significant greenhouse gas emissions, so further research is seen as necessary to develop better processes. The absence of a refueling network is also a challenge. A few manufacturers will introduce fuel cell cars in 2015. Butanol is an alcohol that can be used as a gasoline substitute. It can be produced almost entirely from petroleum, but like ethanol, the colorless alcohol can also be brewed from sugar beets, cereal crops, and corn, though it contains more energy when mixed into gasoline. A blend of 85% butanol and 15% gasoline can be used in unmodified gasoline engines. Butanol depends on natural gas indirectly as fuel source for the distillation processes, can be transported in existing gasoline pipelines, and produces more power per gallon than ethanol. It can be used in existing motor vehicles without any adjustments to the engines and can be sold through gasoline stations, much as gasoline/ethanol blends are sold now.

Most retail and some fleet operations use this process, which requires only a few minutes to fill a 20-gallon-equivalent tank. With time-fill, the CNG is provided straight from utility gas line to the compressor. Since there is no storage tank to draw from, time-fill's speed depends on the size of the compressor; it could take a few minutes or many hours.

Local codes, standards, and permitting processes dictate how CNG stations are to be built. A few states have designated some highways as corridors for building out natural gas service station networks. The South Coast Air Quality Management District and UPS, the package shipping company, are building a natural gas corridor from Las Vegas, NV, to Ontario, CA, with stations that will sell fuel to UPS heavy-duty vehicles as well as to the public. In Utah, Interstate 15 from Idaho to Arizona has been designated as a natural gas vehicle corridor, as has the Texas Clean Transportation Triangle, which connects Houston, San Antonio, and Dallas/Fort Worth.
