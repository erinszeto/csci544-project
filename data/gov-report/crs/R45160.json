The agency ensures that campaign fundraising and spending is publicly reported; that those regulated by the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) and by commission regulations comply and have access to guidance; and that publicly financed presidential campaigns receive funding.", "FECA requires that at least four of six commissioners agree to undertake many of the agency's key policymaking duties. As of this writing, the FEC is operating with four commissioners instead of six. Others reportedly are considering leaving the agency. One nomination to the FEC has been resubmitted during the 115th Congress; no committee or floor action has been taken on it to date.", "It is entirely possible that the FEC will retain at least four commissioners and that the agency will remain able to carry out all its duties. If, however, the FEC loses its policymaking quorum\u2014as happened for six months in 2008\u2014the agency would be unable to hold hearings, issue rules, and enforce campaign finance law and regulation.

Congress created the FEC in 1974, after controversial fundraising during 1960s presidential campaigns and the early 1970s Watergate scandal. The commission is responsible for administering federal campaign finance law and for civil enforcement of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA). The FEC also discloses campaign finance data to the public, conducts compliance training, and administers public financing for participating presidential campaigns. ", "FECA establishes six-year terms for commission members. Commissioners may continue in \"holdover\" status after those terms end. Commissioners are appointed by the President and are subject to Senate confirmation. FECA requires that at least four of the six commissioners vote to make decisions on substantive actions. This includes deciding on enforcement actions, advisory opinions, and rulemaking matters. Because FECA also requires bipartisan commission membership, achieving at least four agreeing votes is sometimes difficult, even with six members present. Vacancies make the task harder by reducing opportunities for a coalition of at least four votes. ", "In 2008, the FEC lost its policymaking quorum for six months. As of this writing, the commission again faces a potential loss of its policymaking quorum because only four commissioners remain in office. One nomination is pending, and the status of future departures remains unclear. These developments notwithstanding, it is unclear whether the agency will lose more commissioners.", "This report provides a brief overview of the FEC's policymaking powers without at least four commissioners in office. The topic may be relevant for congressional oversight of the agency, particularly if it loses its policymaking quorum, and for Senate consideration of nominations to the agency.

Ravel's term would have expired on April 30, 2017. As of this writing, no nominee for the Ravel seat has been announced. On February 7, 2018, Republican Commissioner Lee Goodman announced his intention to resign, effective February 16, 2018. As of this writing, no nominee for the Goodman seat has been announced. Once Goodman left the agency, the FEC had four remaining members.

Petersen could leave the commission. On September 11, 2017, President Trump nominated Petersen for a federal judgeship. Petersen subsequently withdrew from consideration for the judgeship, reportedly writing, \"until the time is otherwise appropriate, I look forward to returning to my duties at the Federal Election Commission.\" Petersen remains on the commission in holdover status after his term expired in 2011. The status of a nomination intended to replace Commissioner Petersen is unclear. After Petersen was nominated to the federal judgeship, but before he withdrew from consideration for that position, President Trump nominated a replacement for Petersen at the FEC. On September 14, 2017, President Trump nominated James E. \"Trey\" Trainor III to the Petersen seat. This nomination was returned to the President at the end of the first session.

Under that structure, two commissioners were appointed by the President, two by the President pro tempore of the Senate, and two by the Speaker of the House. ", "Two federal court decisions altered the FEC's original design. First and most significantly, in Buckley v. Valeo (1976) the Supreme Court of the United States invalidated the original appointments method, holding that congressional appointments violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause. Almost 20 years later, a federal court again found fault with the FEC's appointment structure. In 1993, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held in FEC v. NRA Political Victory Fund that the presence of the two congressional ex officio members violated constitutional separation of powers.

", "FECA specifies few qualifications for FEC commissioners, noting simply that they \"shall be chosen on the basis of their experience, integrity, impartiality, and good judgment.\" As one former general counsel notes, although many commissioners are lawyers, \"a commissioner does not have to be a lawyer and the commission has a long history of having non-lawyers serve as members.\" Commissioners typically have experience as congressional staffers, political professionals, election lawyers, or some combination thereof."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Party Balance and Terms", "paragraphs": ["No more than three commissioners may be affiliated with the same political party.

FECA staggers commissioner terms so that two expire every other April 30 during odd-numbered years (e.g., 2019, 2021, etc.).

Alternatively, an individual might be nominated for an upcoming term with the expectation that the new term will be underway by the time of confirmation.\" Some FEC commissioners have assumed office when the term for which they were nominated was well underway. For example, on June 24, 2008, the Senate confirmed Donald F. McGahn and Steven T. Walther to terms that expired just 10 months later, on April 30, 2009. Both continued serving in their seats past the expiration of their terms, although they could have been replaced through subsequent appointments.", "These and other commissioners could remain in office because FECA permits FEC members to serve in \"holdover\" status, exercising full powers of the office, after their terms expire \"until his or her successor has taken office as a Commissioner.\" As Table 1 above shows, as of this writing, all current commissioners are serving in holdover status.

Following expired recess appointments and amid ongoing Senate consideration of FEC nominations, the agency had just two commissioners for the first six months of the year. In late 2007, in anticipation of only two commissioners remaining in office in 2008, commissioners amended the FEC's rules of internal procedure to permit executing some duties if the agency lost its four-member policymaking quorum. These revisions to the FEC's Directive 10 permit the commission to continue meeting with fewer than four members to approve general public information, such as educational guides; appoint certain staff; and approve other basic administrative and employment matters. ", "During the loss of the commission's policymaking quorum in 2008, the two remaining commissioners (David Mason (R) and Ellen Weintraub (D)) met publicly to discuss advisory opinions, but could not vote to issue those opinions. At the time, the commissioners explained that although they recognized that the commission lacked a quorum, they were attempting to provide general feedback, particularly given the ongoing 2008 election cycle. That practice generated some controversy, however, as some practitioners contended that remaining commissioners did not have the authority to meet and provide guidance. It is unclear whether commissioners would continue the practice in the future with fewer than four members.
