In 1964, the concept of \"prevailing wage\" was expanded to include a fringe benefit component. The statute has also been the subject of technical amendments through the years, and Davis-Bacon provisions have been added to more than 50 federal program statutes.", "The act contains a provision allowing for its suspension by the President of the United States during a \"national emergency.\" It has been suspended on three occasions: in 1934 by President Roosevelt, in 1971 by President Nixon, and in 1992 by President Bush.

If the data are from the pre-Reagan era (as most are), then the resultant studies may be of little use for current economic or policy analysis\u2014the rules for implementation of the act having been changed during that period and, thus, presumably, the cost impact of the statute.", "For many years, virtually the only major study of the statute was Armand Thieblot's 1975 monograph, The Davis-Bacon Act . Funded in part by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and published by The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, it is strongly critical of the act. Thieblot concluded that the act \"makes little sense under conditions of prosperity and expansion and provides far too few benefits to offset its immense costs.\" Thieblot's work was updated in 1986\u2014but appears to rely upon pre-Reagan data.", "What is Thieblot's impact assessment for Davis-Bacon? He notes, broadening the range used by CBO, that \"Davis-Bacon impact estimates have been presented during the past 10 years ranging from less than $50 million to more than $2 billion.\" While he suggests \"there is no direct way to measure the Davis-Bacon impact,\" still, for his own part, he asserts: Davis-Bacon \"costs more to operate than the whole federal judiciary establishment, and perhaps more to run than the entire legislative branch of government.\" The basis for this assertion, however, is unclear.", "Since 1980, Steven Allen has produced a number of studies that deal, directly or indirectly, with Davis-Bacon. In an essay with David Reich, Prevailing Wage Laws Are Not Inflationary , they argue that \"there is strong evidence to suggest that there are significant productivity differences between low-wage and high-wage workers.\" Allen and Reich state: \"Paying at least the locally prevailing wage rate will make it possible to attract better trained and more highly skilled construction workers able to complete the job quickly and efficiently.\" Focusing upon state experience, they conclude that \"once all the relevant variables are taken into consideration, there is no evidence whatsoever of any correlation between the level of construction costs and the presence or absence of a state 'little Davis-Bacon Act.'\" The essay was prepared for the Center to Protect Workers' Rights, chaired by Robert Georgine, President of the Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO. Allen has developed this theme in subsequent academic work and is often cited.", "A 1982 study, Effect of the Davis-Bacon Act on Construction Costs in Non-Metropolitan Areas of the United States , was prepared by Martha N. Fraundorf (with others) of Oregon State University. Fraundorf suggests that the cost estimates for Davis-Bacon offered by GAO, Thieblot, and certain others are based on \"an erroneous procedure\" and she chides GAO for working from a sample even the agency recognized was \"really too small for extrapolation.\" But, the Oregon team, funded by the American Farm Bureau Federation (a critic of Davis-Bacon), was forced to scale back its own work because of difficulties it encountered in securing adequate data.", "Fraundorf and her colleagues began with an assumption: \"While it is fairly clear that the law results in higher wages, it does not follow that the law therefore raises overall costs.\" To determine the latter, they attempted an empirical study of total costs. But, they found this to be complex. First, they looked only at rural non-residential construction\u2014which, they conceded, might differ from urban work. Second, they could not disaggregate Davis-Bacon costs from other federal requirements (i.e., \"affirmative action, or different standards for quality and safety.\") Third, they were not able to access varying \"alternative method[s] of construction.\" Within those parameters, they compared federal with non-federal construction, concluding: \"While the exact size of the impact is still uncertain, our results show that it is likely to be between 26% and 38%.\"", "Frequently cited in the Davis-Bacon literature is the work of economists Robert Goldfarb and John Morrall. Begun as public research for the U.S. Council on Wage and Price Stability (COWPS) during the mid-1970s, the work of Goldfarb and Morrall was further developed in a series of private academic articles. At COWPS, they found themselves working with data provided by DOL which they viewed as not entirely satisfactory for their purposes. In their COWPS analysis (1976), they identified the deficiencies they found in the data they were using and spoke of \"some rough order of magnitude\" of \"possible cost savings\" from changes in the administration of Davis-Bacon. But, they cautioned by way of conclusion: \"... the data are somewhat ambiguous and perhaps unreliable.\"", "In a private academic article (1978), Goldfarb and Morrall seem to have been somewhat less cautious suggesting that, with administrative changes with respect to Davis-Bacon, \"an overall savings in the hundreds of millions is possible.\" And, they point out, various administrative changes \"might well encourage an expansion of the nonunion sector, which might in turn have cost-lowering effects in the long run.\"", "Their work sparked some criticism which, in yet another article (1981), they attempted to refute. Critiques, in the abstract, are difficult to evaluate and, even more so, critiques of critiques; and, by the early 1980s, the literature was beset by argument and counter argument, often focusing (as Goldfarb and Morrall had done themselves in 1976) upon the inadequacies of the data. Seeming to share the approach of Thieblot (and, like Thieblot, basing their work on pre-Reagan data), Goldfarb and Morrall acknowledge the data problems but reject the notion \"that this invalidates the usefulness of cost calculations.\" They affirm, rather, that even \"rough estimates of possible magnitudes of effects based on imperfect data are very useful background information for helping inform policy decisions.\"", "During the early 1980s, a private sector body working under the auspices of the Reagan Administration reviewed the operation of the federal government and recommended ways in which to effect efficiency and reduce costs. The Grace Commission, as it was popularly known, examined the operation of the Davis-Bacon Act (among other statutes and programs). Its review of Davis-Bacon, frequently cited at the time, was based on prior studies rather than original research. Thus, it was subject to all of the strengths and weaknesses of the earlier research upon which it relied.", "In 1985, Chairman J. Peter Grace reviewed the work of the commission in testimony before the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs. Evidencing some exasperation with quibbles over impact estimates in general, he urged that policymakers should set aside the dispute about \"how accurate the numbers are\" and get on with the business of reform. \"No one can ever tell what something will save until one does it,\" he affirmed. While many may share Grace's frustration, others may argue that numbers do matter and that reasonable precision is important\u2014especially when cost-savings projections become a central rationale in public policy formation.", "During recent years, Peter Philips, professor of economics at the University of Utah, with others, has produced a number of analyses of the impact of state \"little Davis-Bacon\" acts\u2014or, of the implications of the repeal of such statutes. Speaking generally, these studies appear to have found a certain utility in prevailing wage legislation: i.e., that prevailing wage statutes may (and, likely do) have positive economic impacts for the community apart from any advantage to workers. Further, these studies seem to suggest that allegations of negative impact (for example, unjustifiably inflating the cost of public construction\u2014or increasing such costs at all) may be overstated."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Bibliography", "paragraphs": ["Through the years, the Davis-Bacon Act has attracted considerable attention from economists, attorneys, policy analysts, journalists and others. The result is a moderately extensive bibliography of materials readily available to the public. Its quality, as noted above, varies from one item to another.", "Most of the entries in this bibliography deal specifically with Davis-Bacon. There are, however, a number that focus upon issues related tangentially (but importantly) to questions that have been raised about the application of the act. For example, an extensive literature has been developed dealing with the impact of trade unions upon productivity, a central factor in estimating the cost impact of the act. A representative sample of these studies has been included in the listing.

While primarily of published materials, it also includes, in a few instances, materials that have not been published but which have been widely circulated through the years and/or which have had an impact upon the Davis-Bacon debate.

Also omitted (with select exceptions) are studies produced by the Department of Labor and the several legislative branch agencies such as the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office.", "There has been, through the years, a significant reportage concerning the Davis-Bacon Act in the industry and trade union press: sometimes brief editorial comment; on other occasions, publication of testimony presented before a committee of the Congress or an analysis of legislation. For the most part, these industry and trade union materials have not been included, though this latter policy has not been followed uniformly. Finally, there are a number of manuals\u2014how to administer the act, how to conduct wage surveys, how to comply with the provisions of the statute\u2014that have been prepared by an agency or one of the interest groups.
