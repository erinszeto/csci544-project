Over a third of the U.S. population lived in shoreline counties in 2010, with more expected by 2020 as people continue to migrate to coastal areas to take advantage of economic opportunities, retire, and pursue recreational interests. Coastal areas are also home to economic sectors such as fishing, transportation, defense, offshore energy, and tourism and to natural resources such as estuaries, beach systems, and wetlands. The shoreline likely will continue to be affected by pressures to develop and preserve areas, large-scale events (e.g., hurricanes and tsunamis), and long-term changes (e.g., relative sea level, changes in rainfall, wetland loss, and increased temperatures). In addition to responding to these pressures, Congress may continue to consider whether CZMA is being effectively implemented and whether changes should be made to CZMA grant programs.

Regardless of the mediation outcomes, the federal agency may proceed with its activities or development projects if the agency provides a legal basis for being consistent to the maximum extent practicable , or the agency has concluded that its proposed action is fully consistent with the participant's enforceable policies. Federal license or permit activities, outer continental shelf plans, and federal assistance to state and local governments: If the participant objects to the consistency certification, the federal agency cannot authorize the action unless the Secretary of Commerce overrides the objection. The applicant may appeal to the Secretary, who then will review the administrative record and may override a participant's objection if he or she finds that the action is consistent with the objectives of CZMA or is necessary for national security. For example, in 2008, the Secretary of Commerce overrode Maryland's objection to an applicant's consistency determination, finding that \"the project [was] consistent with the objectives of CZMA.\" ", "According to NOAA, participants review thousands of federal consistency determination each year, with more than half of the reviews being for federal license or permit activities. Remaining reviews are, in descending order, federal agency activities and development projects, federal financial assistance activities, and outer continental shelf plans. Over time, participants have concurred with 93% to 95% of the federal consistency determinations they have reviewed. The high concurrence rate may indicate that participants, federal agencies, and applicants often have negotiated project modifications or alternatives before the formal review process.", "Since the first CMP was approved in 1978, 45 consistency decisions have been subject to secretarial appeals, most recently in 2014 ( Figure 2 ). Of the 45 appeals, the Secretary overrode participant objections in 14 cases and agreed with the participant in the other 31 cases. An additional 65 appeals have been settled or withdrawn after they reached the secretarial level but before a determination was made, and 33 additional requests for appeals were dismissed or overridden on procedural grounds.

According to the 2010 census, coastal shoreline counties were home to over 123 million people (39% of the U.S. population), and were expected to grow by another 10 million people by 2020. The ocean and Great Lakes economy accounted for 2.3% of total employment and contributed $320 billion to the total U.S. gross domestic product in 2015. Much of the population and infrastructure growth has occurred in shoreline communities amid ecosystems such as beaches, reefs, sea grasses, wetlands, estuaries, and deltas. The combination of built and natural systems has been and likely will continue to be affected by changes in sea level (and its impacts, such as higher tides, greater storm surge, saltwater intrusion, erosion, etc.), local rainfall, increasing water and air temperatures, and ocean acidification, among other factors. ", "Several bills to amend CZMA would have addressed some of these changes. In the 115 th Congress, Members proposed bills focused on climate change preparedness or adaptation (e.g., H.R. 3533 and H.R. 4426 ) and \"working waterfronts\" (e.g., H.R. 1176 ). Other proposals would have expanded CZMA grant programs to locations (the District of Columbia, e.g., S. 3146 and H.R. 2540 ) and groups (Indian tribes, e.g., H.R. 2607 ) currently not eligible to apply to the grant programs. In previous Congresses, other bills proposed additional grant programs related to offshore activities, such as renewable energy siting surveys (e.g., H.R. 1690 , 111 th Congress), responses to oil spills and other disasters related to outer continental shelf energy activity (e.g., H.R. 3757 , 112 th Congress), aquaculture siting (e.g., H.R. 2046 , 104 th Congress), harmful algal blooms (e.g., H.R. 4235 , 105 th Congress), and Great Lakes restoration (e.g., S. 2337 , 108 th Congress).

The effectiveness of CZMA implementation, specifically the NCZMP, has been evaluated since the law's enactment by a variety of entities, including the Department of Commerce inspector general, the Office of Management and Budget, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), and scholars. Evaluations have noted a range of issues, from monitoring and measuring the success of the program as a whole to issues concerning specific grant programs. ", "GAO reported several issues with NOAA's implementation of CZMA and program evaluation in a 2014 report, including limitations to the coastal zone management performance measurement system, weaknesses in NOAA's method for selecting stakeholders for state program evaluations, and the agency's limited use of collected performance data. NOAA agreed with the recommendations. It is unclear whether NOAA has completed changes to address GAO's recommendations fully. In a separate 2016 study, GAO surveyed state coastal zone managers about the actions NOAA was taking under CZMA to support state efforts to make marine coastal ecosystems more resilient to climate change. GAO found that state coastal zone managers \"generally had positive views of the actions NOAA [was] taking.\"", "Some have argued that the implementation of some CZMA programs has been inadequate. For example, some have questioned whether Section 6217 provisions have been properly implemented. Section 6217 of the Coastal Zone Reauthorization Amendments Act ( P.L. 101-508 ) amended CZMA to establish the Coastal Nonpoint Pollution Control Program (CNPCP). The CNPCP requires coastal states with approved CMPs to reduce polluted runoff to coastal waters through coastal nonpoint pollution control programs that include specific land-based measures. NOAA and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) jointly administer the CNPCP. Under Section 6217(c)(3), participants that fail to submit \"approvable programs\" lose a portion of their allotted funding under CZMA Section 306. Most participants received conditional approval between 1997 and 1998, and the majority have since received final approval. Several states have yet to receive final approval, including Alabama, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, and Washington. In 2009 and 2016, a private organization sued NOAA and EPA for continuing to grant funds to Oregon and Washington, respectively. According to NOAA, the agency and EPA currently are working with the conditionally approved states to address the programs' remaining conditions.

For example, in a 2016 GAO survey, state coastal zone managers stated that \"financial assistance provided by NOAA [was] critical\" and that \"the amount of financial assistance available [was] insufficient to address states' needs in implementing projects.\" NOAA officials also have stated that financial assistance for coastal zone management is in high demand. For example, the NOAA Regional Coastal Resilience grant program, administered under Section 310, received 132 applications requesting $105 million in FY2015; $4.5 million was available for grants.
