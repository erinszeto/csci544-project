Title I of AWIA, \"Water Resources Development Act of 2018,\" authorizes water resource development activities for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Title II of AWIA constitutes the most comprehensive amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) since 1996. Title III primarily includes provisions that address hydropower-related activities of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Among its provisions, Title IV amends U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-administered water infrastructure programs and several Clean Water Act authorities.", "This report focuses on the drinking water provisions of Title II and Title IV of AWIA, which authorize appropriations for several drinking water and wastewater infrastructure programs for projects that promote compliance, address aging drinking water infrastructure and lead in school drinking water, and increase drinking water infrastructure resilience to natural hazards.", "Title II amends SDWA to help communities achieve SDWA compliance, revise the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) program, reauthorize appropriations for the DWSRF program, and increase emphasis on assisting disadvantaged communities. Provisions in Title II also revise emergency notification and planning requirements; authorize the use of DWSRF funds for the assessment and protection of drinking water sources; identify options intended to develop public water systems' technical, managerial, and financial capacity; and improve consumer confidence in public drinking water supplies. Title II authorizes a supplemental DWSRF appropriation for disaster assistance for public water systems in certain areas under certain conditions. Other provisions authorize new grant programs to reduce lead contamination in school drinking water, improve drinking water infrastructure for specified Indian tribes, respond to contamination of small and disadvantaged communities' drinking water sources, and improve the sustainability and resilience of small and disadvantaged communities' drinking water systems.", "Title IV addresses several other water quality and infrastructure issues by authorizing and revising activities and programs for the EPA and other federal agencies. Title IV extends, authorizes, and amends drinking-water-related activities and programs administered by EPA. Specifically, these provisions authorize WaterSense, an EPA-initiated voluntary water efficiency labeling program, and revise the Water Instructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) financial assistance program. The WIFIA program provides credit assistance for water infrastructure projects. Other provisions authorize grant programs for innovative water technology and for water sector workforce development. Title IV also amends the Clean Water Act to expand a municipal sewer overflow grant program to include stormwater management projects, reauthorize appropriations for that program, and direct EPA to establish a task force for stormwater management.", "With AWIA, the 115th Congress passed an omnibus water infrastructure and project authorization bill that affects several federal agencies.

Such events include the detection of elevated lead levels in tap water in Flint, MI, and other cities; hurricanes and other natural disasters that damaged or destroyed community drinking water infrastructure; and local source water contamination events (e.g., chemical spills and algal blooms).", "Representatives of state drinking water agencies, private sector engineers, and others report that much of the nation's drinking water infrastructure is deteriorating, threatening public health, and increasing operations and maintenance costs. In 2012, the American Water Works Association (AWWA) reported that much of the drinking water infrastructure (more than 1 million miles of buried pipe) was constructed in the 19 th and 20 th centuries and is nearing the end of its useful life. While disagreement exists over the scope and costs of improvement and replacements, estimates of the funding needs are substantial.", "In March 2018, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued its sixth Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey and Assessment. In this survey, EPA estimated that public water systems would need to invest $472.60 billion for drinking water capital improvements over the next 20 years to achieve compliance and ensure the provision of safe drinking water. Although all projects identified in the needs survey would promote health objectives, EPA reported that 12% of the 20-year estimated need was directly attributed to statutory compliance. The majority (88%) of needs are for ongoing investments, such as repair of aging drinking water infrastructure.", "In 2012, AWWA conducted a broader drinking water infrastructure survey that reported that the costs to replace aging drinking water infrastructure and expand water service to growing populations will increase to more than $1 trillion over the next 25 years. ", "Communities nationwide may face financial challenges as they manage the need to repair or replace aging drinking water infrastructure. As of early 2019, EPA's database indicated that some 50,000 public water systems in the United States regularly serve 25 or more of the same individuals. About 80% of these community water systems are relatively small, serving 3,300 or fewer people. These small systems have a narrow rate base from which to finance drinking water infrastructure improvements. In addition, older cities may face declining populations and declining utility revenues from which utilities can finance drinking water infrastructure repairs. In 2012, AWWA estimated that the costs to address aging drinking water infrastructure may as much as triple household water bills. Due to these financing concerns, communities may be challenged to protect water supplies, respond to contamination incidents, and afford projects to repair or replace aging drinking water infrastructure. ", "Congress deliberated on several of these drinking water infrastructure issues while developing America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 (AWIA; P.L. 115-270 ), enacted on October 23, 2018. Title I of the act, \"The Water Resource Development Act of 2018,\" authorizes a wide variety of water resource and infrastructure policies, programs, and projects for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Water Resource Development Act bills are often considered on a biennial schedule and have primarily addressed USACE projects. Title III of AWIA primarily addresses hydropower activities of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Title II and IV of the act include provisions that address EPA water infrastructure programs and other authorities. ", "This report analyzes the drinking water provisions of Title II and IV rather than providing a comprehensive summary of AWIA. ", "Title II constitutes the most comprehensive reauthorization of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) since 1996. It amends SDWA to promote compliance with SDWA requirements, reauthorize appropriations for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) program, expand program eligibilities, increase emphasis on assisting disadvantaged communities, make SDWA compliance more affordable, and improve consumer confidence in public water supplies. Title II also authorizes new grant programs to reduce lead contamination in school drinking water, assist small and disadvantaged communities, and develop public water system resilience, among other purposes.

Title IV of AWIA extends, authorizes, and amends drinking-water-related activities and provisions administered by EPA. Specifically, these provisions authorize a water efficiency program and activities and revise the Water Infrastructure Finance Innovation Act (WIFIA) program, which provides credit assistance for water infrastructure projects. Title IV of AWIA also includes several amendments to the Clean Water Act to address stormwater by expanding a municipal sewer overflow grant programs to include stormwater management projects, reauthorizing appropriations for said municipal sewer overflow grant program, and directing EPA to establish a task force for stormwater management.

States may use DWSRF financing for public water system projects needed to comply with federal drinking water standards and address risks to human health. The primary type of DWSRF financial assistance are low interest rate loans. SDWA Section 1452 authorizes states to provide additional subsidization (including forgiveness of principal) to disadvantaged communities.
