For this reason, although preschool students are guaranteed equal access to public preschool and Pre-K programs under EHCY, they do not have the same guarantee of being able to attend public school as K-12 homeless students do. Although homeless preschoolers are eligible to attend public preschool programs, placement of homeless preschoolers in public programs is limited by the fact that there is not a sufficient supply of these programs, and programs that do exist often do not have sufficient vacancies to fill the need. In addition, preschoolers, unlike K-12 children and youth, are only guaranteed transportation if it is provided to non-homeless preschoolers at the school. This creates a significant barrier to school attendance for homeless preschoolers, because many homeless families are often unable to provide the needed transportation for their preschoolers.", "The Senate HELP Committee bill included an increased emphasis on school readiness for homeless preschoolers. New provisions would have required each state plan to ensure that preschools that are funded, administered, or overseen by an SEA or LEA prioritize the enrollment of homeless preschoolers, and coordinate the review of educational and related needs of homeless children and their families with the local liaison in the relevant service area.

These youth are covered by the same protections that are provided to other homeless youth under EHCY. However, outreach to these youth is difficult because they usually do not stay in shelters, and in some cases they are fearful of being identified, even though they may wish to complete their education. Unaccompanied homeless youth have often run away from a difficult home situation, or been forced to leave by a parent or guardian. These students often struggle to find a place to sleep and meet their basic needs. In addition, many of these youth worry that attending school would be unsafe because the school might involve child welfare agencies or law enforcement. According to advocates, providing programs that make schools safe and welcoming to subgroups of unaccompanied youth who are overrepresented can help. Because of their situation, these youth benefit from receiving more flexibility in their school schedule than other students, and from diversified learning opportunities such as vocational education. Promising approaches to serving these students include providing a mentor; coordinating with other agencies to help meet the basic needs of these youth; as well as policies that facilitate the awarding of partial credit or recovery of previous credits.", "Both the Senate HELP Committee bill and the House Education and Workforce Committee bill ( H.R. 3990 ) included new language that would have required that homeless liaisons ensure that unaccompanied youth are enrolled and have the same opportunities to meet state academic standards as other students.

This change would have made these newly identified individuals and their families eligible for HUD housing assistance services, without requiring that they meet the detailed criteria or be subject to the funding cap included in the HEARTH Act ( P.L. 111-22 ).

The amended definition of homeless included in the HEARTH Act does allow children and youth that meet EHCY eligibility criteria (or eligibility under certain other federal programs) to be considered eligible under the HEARTH Act in limited circumstances.
