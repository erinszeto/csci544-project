In any type of insurance arrangement, all parties seek to manage their risk, subject to certain objectives (e.g., coverage and/or profit goals). In health insurance, consumers (patients as insurance beneficiaries) and insurers (as providers or sellers of insurance) approach the management of insurance risk differently. From the consumer's point of view, a person (or family) buys health insurance to protect against financial losses resulting from the unpredictable use of potentially high-cost medical care. The insurer employs a variety of methods to manage the risk it takes on when providing health coverage to consumers to assure that the insurer operates a viable business (e.g., balancing premiums against the collective risk of the covered population). The insurer uses these methods when pooling risk so that premiums collected from all enrollees generally are sufficient to fund claims (plus administrative expenses and profits). ", "Sometimes, however, even with the variety of methods an insurer may employ to manage risk, the risk taken on by the insurer may not be sufficient to protect against the chosen risk management strategies. For example, a single health insurance company may be unable to cover a catastrophic loss (i.e., individuals who experience illnesses that result in huge expenditures). To limit their risk exposure, insurers often transfer some of their liability or risk to another insurer, a reinsurance company. That is, just as an insurer pools the risk of its covered consumers, a portion of that risk gets further spread to other insurance companies, known as reinsurers. ", "Reinsurance, thus, is an extension of insurance and further acts as a risk-transfer and risk-spreading mechanism. Insurers often purchase reinsurance for four reasons: (1) to limit liability on specific risks; (2) to stabilize loss experience; (3) to protect against catastrophes; and (4) to increase capacity by taking on more risk (i.e., more covered individuals). The availability of reinsurance allows insurers to reduce their risk exposure and can affect the availability and affordability of health insurance coverage. That is, the availability of reinsurance may be one of many factors an insurer considers in assessing potential exposure to loss in a certain market. This may affect whether or not to enter a market, what types of products to offer, and how premiums are set.", "Reinsurance also may be structured in different ways depending on the insurers' needs and can range from simple to complex. Generally, however, reinsurance contracts either may be a broad agreement covering some portion of the business or may cover a specific risk. ", "Occasionally, the government may act as the reinsurer in certain markets to provide a stabilizing influence. Governmental involvement in insurance and reinsurance is not a new concept, and the government covers risks in many markets (outside of health insurance). One example of the federal government acting as a reinsurer is through the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA; P.L. 107-297 ). Prior to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, insurance covering terrorism losses was normally included in general insurance policies without additional cost to the policyholders. Following the attacks, both primary insurers and reinsurers pulled back from offering terrorism coverage. TRIA created a temporary, three-year terrorism insurance program to calm the insurance markets through a government reinsurance backstop sharing in terrorism losses.", "The ACA provides another example in which the federal government acts as the reinsurer in an insurance market. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The ACA and Risk Mitigation", "paragraphs": ["The ACA includes provisions that restructure the private health insurance market by implementing several market reforms, including some that impose requirements on health insurance plans. As part of a larger set of private health insurance market reforms, the ACA requires private health insurers to provide coverage to individuals regardless of health status, medical history, and preexisting conditions. Under the ACA, insurers can adjust premiums based solely on certain ACA-specified factors (i.e., individual or family enrollment, geographic rating area, tobacco use, and age). Further, some individuals may be eligible for financial assistance (i.e., premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies) through the health insurance exchanges (also known as the marketplaces). In addition, the ACA requires that most individuals maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty for noncompliance (i.e., the individual mandate). ", "As previously mentioned, the insurer often employs a variety of methods to manage the risk it takes on when providing health coverage to consumers. For instance, insurers often use projected enrollment, projected claims costs, and other policy-specific features (e.g., consumer cost sharing, provider networks) for a pool of individuals to set health insurance rates. Yet, prior to ACA implementation, little information was known regarding many of these factors in the newly created markets. ", "Accordingly, the new ACA market reforms and the expanded pool of individuals seeking to purchase health insurance coverage contribute to the uncertainty that insurers face in the early years of ACA implementation. Much of the uncertainty centers on the types of individuals who may or may not seek coverage. For example, to what extent would healthy individuals decide to seek coverage in addition to unhealthy individuals? Also, did the expanded pool extend to individuals who were previously uninsured and/or may have delayed receiving health care services? Furthermore, what was the demand for health care services for this expanded pool of individuals?", "To mitigate the financial risk that insurers face and to stabilize the price of health insurance in the non-group and small-group markets, the ACA establishes three risk mitigation programs: the transitional reinsurance program, the permanent risk adjustment program, and the temporary risk corridors program.

The Secretary established a methodology whereby contributing entities pay a per person amount based on their enrollment. The per person contribution (i.e., the per capita national contribution) was calculated as the sum of (1) the aggregate contribution for the reinsurance program, (2) the additional contribution to the U.S. Treasury, and (3) the cost of administration divided by the estimated number of enrollees in plans required to make reinsurance contributions (see Figure 1 ).

The HHS Secretary is implementing the transitional reinsurance program for all states, citing the authority under Section 1321(c)(1) of the ACA. Under this authority, the Secretary may \"take such actions as are necessary\" to ensure that the requirements of the transitional reinsurance program are met. In those states where the federal government is implementing the transitional reinsurance program, HHS (through CMS) acts as the reinsurance entity for purposes of Section 1341 of the ACA, collecting contributions from covered insurers and third-party administrators (i.e., contributing entities), as well as making payments from those contributions to eligible insurers under the program.", "CMS currently allocates all collections in a given year to reinsurance payments for insurers until the statutory collection targets for those purposes have been met. Once the statutory collection targets for a year are satisfied, any further collections in that year would be allocated to program administration expenses and to the U.S. Treasury. Prior to adopting this allocation formula, CMS had issued a final rule with a different allocation method, which has since been amended. In its 2015 Payment Notice issued on March 11, 2014, the first collection was allocated solely toward reinsurance payments and program administration expenses, whereas the second collection was allocated only to the U.S. Treasury. ", "Subsequently, in a March 21, 2014, proposed rule, CMS sought comment on its \"legal authority to implement a prioritization of reinsurance contributions to reinsurance payments over payments to the U.S. Treasury.\" One commenter described Section 1341 of the ACA as \"impos[ing] few requirements on the expenditure of reinsurance contributions, stating that the statute does not specify that payments must be made to insurers and to the U.S. Treasury simultaneously, or that the U.S. Treasury must receive its full funding before reinsurance pool payments are made.\" CMS noted its agreement with this argument, stating that Section 1341 \"provides [the agency] with the discretion ... to determine the priority, method, and timing for the allocation of reinsurance contributions collected.\" Consistent with this conclusion, a final rule issued on May 27, 2014, revised the allocation formula. Under the current system, no funds collected from insurers are deposited in the Treasury until sufficient amounts have been received to fund the reinsurance program. ", "The permissibility of CMS's final rule has been called into question by some observers. On September 29, 2016, GAO issued a legal opinion stating that the current method of allocating contributions from insurers is not authorized by Section 1341. In its opinion, GAO focused on the language of Section 1341, noting that when Congress has enacted statutory language that speaks directly to an issue, such statutory language, viewed in the context of the overall statutory scheme, must control. In particular, Section 1341 states that each insurer's contribution into the transitional reinsurance program \"shall be designed so that each issuer's contribution amount for any calendar year ... reflects its proportionate share of an additional $2,000,000,000 for 2014, an additional $2,000,000,000 for 2015, and an additional $1,000,000,000 for 2016.\"", "GAO noted that this provision uses the mandatory term \"shall\" when directing HHS to collect amounts from insurers for the U.S. Treasury. The use of this term led GAO to the conclusion that the plain language of Section 1341 \"requires[s] HHS to collect amounts for the Treasury and do so without qualification.\" In reaching this conclusion, GAO rejected CMS's argument that the use of the term \"reflects\" indicated that CMS retained a degree of flexibility in determining how to assess an insurer's U.S. Treasury contribution. In GAO's view, the plain language and structure of the statutory provision counseled against a permissive reading of the statute's allocation requirements.", "Further, GAO concluded that the statute \"explicitly prohibits\" such amounts collected for the U.S. Treasury from being used for reinsurance payments to insurers. Where overall collections were insufficient to meet the statutory targets, GAO stated that the proper course of action was to apportion the receipts between reinsurance payments and the U.S. Treasury on a pro rata basis instead of prioritizing one over the other. In support of this pro rata allocation of collections, GAO cited federal court decisions that held that, in cases where programs of federal spending were underfunded, the agency should \"preserve the allocation formula\" provided in the statute rather than exercise \"total discretion in the allocation of the funds.\" ", "Following the issuance of GAO's opinion, CMS indicated that it disagreed with GAO's conclusions and would continue to prioritize collections toward reinsurance payments. Past opinions by the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) in the Department of Justice have taken the position that GAO legal opinions are not binding upon the executive branch, \"[a]lthough the opinions and legal interpretations of the GAO and the Comptroller General often provide helpful guidance on appropriations matters and related issues.... \"", "Other commentators have argued that the Supreme Court's recent decision in King v. Burwell counsels interpreting the ACA \"[i]f at all possible ... in a way that is consistent\" with \"improving health insurance markets, not to destroy them.\" In King , a majority of the court rejected a literal application of the statutory provision governing health insurance premium subsidies in part because such a reading would have resulted in significantly higher premiums and lower enrollment. Arguably, CMS's prioritization of reinsurance contributions for reinsurance payments over U.S. Treasury contributions provides greater assistance to insurers by ensuring that more funding is available to make reinsurance payments to those insurers that enroll high-cost individuals. If the market consequences of not allowing such prioritization of reinsurance contributions would be similarly as significant, it could be argued that King suggests it might be permissible to depart from \"the most natural reading of the statute.\" ", "On the other hand, if allocating contributions to the U.S. Treasury would not result in the same degree of harm to the insurance market, it might be argued that the Court's opinion in King would not have any applicability to the interpretation of Section 1341 of the ACA. Moreover, the King Court's interpretation of the ACA provision was not simply based upon the potential policy consequences of a literal reading of the provision; rather, the Court's interpretation of the ACA provision was guided in part by the \"broader structure\" of ACA. Relying upon \"the fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme,\" the King Court determined that support existed to interpret the ACA provision in a manner different than a plain reading of the text might initially suggest. It is not clear that a reviewing court would necessarily believe that the King ruling supports construing Section 1341 in a manner contrary to the reading suggested by its plain text, unless evidence could be found elsewhere in the ACA that favored a different interpretation. To date, it does not appear that any suits have been filed challenging CMS's prioritization of reinsurance contributions for reinsurance payments over U.S. Treasury contributions.
