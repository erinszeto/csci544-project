Several statutes supply such authorization. For instance, federal courts are statutorily required to order victim restitution when sentencing a defendant either for an offense against property, including fraud or deceit, proscribed in Title 18 of the United States Code or for a crime of violence. The obligation exists even if the defendant is indigent, and restitution must take the form of in-kind, lump sum, or installment payments. Federal courts are permitted, but not required, to order victim restitution when sentencing a defendant for any offense proscribed in Title 18 for which restitution is not required. Federal courts are permitted to order victim restitution when sentencing a defendant for various controlled substance and aviation safety offenses. In addition, a federal court may order restitution pursuant to a plea bargain or as a condition of probation or supervised release.", "As a general rule, restitution is available only to victims who have suffered a physical injury or financial loss as a direct and proximate consequence of the crime of conviction, and only to the extent of their losses. Several provisions governing restitution following conviction for particular crimes permit awards for types of losses that might not otherwise be permitted under the general restitution provisions. For example, the Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act of 2008 (18 U.S.C. 3663(b)(6)) authorizes restitution orders to compensate victims for the cost of remediating the intended or actual harm caused by certain identity theft violations. The courts are divided over the extent to which a defendant convicted of possession of child pornography may be ordered to make restitution to the child depicted in the material.", "When restitution is to be ordered, a probation officer gathers information from victims, the government, the defendant, and other sources for a report to the court. The parties receive copies of the report and may contest its recommendations. The court has considerable discretion as to the manner and scheduling of restitution payments, but the authority may not be delegated to probation or prison officials. Furthermore, the order must provide for full restitution for all victims unless the sheer number of victims or the complications of a given case preclude such an order.", "Under the abatement doctrine, when a defendant dies before his or her appeal has become final, the law treats the indictment and conviction as though they had never happened. The conviction is vacated and the indictment dismissed. The courts do not agree on whether the doctrine also reaches unfulfilled obligations under a restitution order.", "This report is available in an abridged form\u2014without footnotes, citations to most authorities, or appendixes\u2014as CRS Report RS22708, Restitution in Federal Criminal Cases: A Sketch.

In addition, several individual restitution statutes authorize awards for particular offenses. In addition, federal courts may order restitution as a condition of probation or supervised release.

"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Restitution has a diverse pedigree. Grounded in fairness and often thought of as an equitable remedy, its antecedents can as easily be found in law as in equity. As its name implies, restitution restores the victim to the status quo ante, that is, making the depleted victim whole again. Restitution has been a feature of the federal system of criminal justice for over a century. In its earliest form, some federal judges claimed it as a component of their inherent authority to grant probation and suspended sentences. Then in 1916, the Supreme Court held that the lower federal courts had no inherent power to suspend sentences. Congress responded by granting the courts explicit authority to suspend sentences and to place defendants on probation. In doing so, the courts were permitted to require probationers \"to pay in one or several sums a fine imposed at the time of being placed on probation and ... to make restitution or reparation to the aggrieved party or parties for actual damages or loss caused by the offense for which conviction was had, and ... to provide for the support of any person or persons for whose support\" they were \"legally responsible.\" This authority continued essentially unchanged for more than 50 years. Even though the federal courts enjoyed no other power to order restitution in a criminal case, the authority was \"infrequently used and indifferently enforced.\"", "Congress found this situation unsatisfactory. Thus, in the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 (VWPA), it vested federal courts with the general discretion to order restitution in any criminal case arising out of a crime proscribed in Title 18 of the United States Code or in air piracy cases. In the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Congress established mandatory restitution as a consequence of conviction for the federal crimes of sexual abuse, sexual exploitation of children, and domestic violence. Then, in the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act (MVRA) portion of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Congress made mandatory restitution a consequence of conviction for most of the serious federal crimes (i.e., crimes of violence and, when proscribed in Title 18 of the United States Code , crimes against property, including fraud)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Constitutional Considerations", "paragraphs": ["Restitution's varied lineage\u2014equitable and legal, civil and criminal\u2014has spurred a number of constitutional challenges over the years. Some initially saw restitution as an alternative to civil litigation on behalf of the victims of crime. If this were the case, defendants claimed that they should enjoy a Seventh Amendment right to have a jury determine the facts upon which a restitution order was based. Their challenges came to naught. The Supreme Court held that the Seventh Amendment extends only to civil actions similar to those tried before a jury when the Amendment was ratified in 1791. The lower courts rejected the Seventh Amendment challenges either because they concluded that restitution was a criminal rather than a civil sanction or because, at common law, restitution was not a matter presented to a jury; in some cases, the challenges were rejected for both reasons.", "However, if restitution is a criminal sanction, must it observe the constitutional restrictions on sanctions, such as the proscriptions on ex post facto laws, excessive fines, and cruel and unusual punishments? If the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial in civil cases has no bearing, what of the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial in criminal cases?", "On the question of retroactive application of new laws and the ex post facto clause, there is no consensus among the lower federal appellate courts, although a majority take the position that the clause applies and, consequently, exposure to increased restitution liability may not be applied retroactively.", "The scant case law available on the issue indicates that the Eighth Amendment's excessive fines clause, as well as its cruel and unusual punishment clause, mark the outer bounds of the courts' restitution authority. These limitations, however, impose no real impediments. They condemn fines and punishments that are grossly disproportionate; restitution, by definition under federal law, must be precisely proportionate to the harm caused by the offense.", "As for the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial and the Fifth Amendment right to conviction only on proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the Supreme Court held in a series of cases beginning with Apprendi v. New Jersey and culminating in United States v. Booker , that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial and the Fifth Amendment right to due process require that \"any fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\" ", "This might seem to pose a problem for federal restitution procedures under which restitution is determined by the court (not a jury) on the basis of a preponderance of the evidence (not beyond a reasonable doubt). Nevertheless, the lower federal appellate courts have rejected arguments that the Apprendi line of cases clouds the validity of a restitution order under such circumstances\u2014either because they do not consider restitution a criminal sanction and thus see no Fifth or Sixth Amendment concerns or because they feel the restitution statutes fail to set the \"statutory maximum\" necessary to trigger Apprendi concerns. None of the other due process or equal protection challenges appear to have survived appellate scrutiny thus far."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Victims", "paragraphs": ["The various federal restitution statutes address three questions: Who qualifies as a victim? What crimes trigger restitution authority? What type of injuries or losses does restitution cover? As originally cast, \u00a73663 (VWPA) authorized restitution for \"any victim\" of any crime proscribed in title 18 of the United States Code , but did not define the term \"victim.\" The Supreme Court read the statute narrowly and concluded that restitution might only extend to harm attributable to the crime of conviction. Congress endorsed this view almost immediately with a more explicit statement of \u00a73663's coverage. It replicated and enlarged that statement when it enacted \u00a73663A six years later.", "Sections 3663 and 3663A authorize restitution orders for the benefit of the victims of the crime of conviction, and expressly define the term \"victim\" (i.e., \"a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered\"). A victim is also someone harmed by a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of activity that is an element of the crime of conviction. And, a victim may be someone whom the government and the defendant agree in a plea bargain is entitled to restitution. ", "Harm is directly caused by the defendant's offense of conviction when the harm would not have occurred but for that misconduct. Directly caused harm is proximately caused when there is no attenuation between the crime and the harm; when the harm and but-for misconduct are closely, not remotely, related in time and fact. The presence of an intervening cause of the harm may suggest a want of either direct causation, or proximate causation, or both. The presence of an intervening cause will defeat an assertion of direct and proximate harm unless intervening cause is related to or a foreseeable consequence of the offense of conviction. As the Supreme Court explained in the context of one of the specialized restitution statutes,", "As a general matter, to say one event proximately caused another is a way of making two separate but related assertions. First, it means the former event caused the latter.... Every event has many causes, however, and only some of them are proximate.... So to say that one event was a proximate cause of another means that it was not just any cause, but one with a sufficient connection to the result. The idea of proximate cause.... is a flexible concept, that generally refers to the basic requirement that there must be some direct relation between the injury asserted and injurious conduct alleged.... Proximate cause is often explicated in terms of foreseeability or the scope of the risk created by the predicate conduct. A requirement of proximate cause thus serves, inter alia, to preclude liability in situations where the causal link between conduct and result is so attenuated that the consequence is more aptly described as mere fortuity.", "The definition of a victim for purposes of restitution under \u00a7\u00a73663 and 3663A expands when the crime of conviction has as an element a conspiracy or a scheme or pattern of misconduct. In the case of conspiracy, a defendant may be compelled to make restitution both for the harm caused by his or her own misconduct and for the harm caused by the foreseeable misconduct of his or her coconspirators.", "As for the scheme and pattern exception, most federal crimes do not list schemes or patterns among their elements, although the mail fraud, wire fraud, and racketeering statutes do. In such cases, restitution may include the losses incurred from a different episode of the scheme than the one mentioned in the indictment. Yet the scheme must be the same; victims entitled to restitution do not include those harmed by an otherwise identical scheme but different in time or place than the crime of conviction.", "The courts are divided over which statutes qualify as \"scheme, conspiracy or pattern\" laws. Some say the scheme or pattern must be an element of the crime of conviction; it is not enough that the defendant's crime involves contrivance or repeated related criminality. Others say it is enough; the statute proscribing the crime of conviction need not use the words \"scheme,\" or \"conspiracy,\" or \"pattern.\"", "Sections 3663 and 3663A describe, with somewhat overlapping grants of authority, the circumstances under which representatives and others may stand in the shoes of a victim. A court may also order restitution pursuant to a plea bargain for \"victims\" who would not otherwise qualify.", "Although a victim must be a \"person\" and governmental entities are ordinarily not considered persons, state, local, and federal governmental entities are entitled to restitution orders when they otherwise qualify as victims of a crime under \u00a7\u00a73663 and 3663A.", "On the other hand, although the courts enjoy authority to order restitution paid to family members on behalf of the victims of crime, it is unclear whether the victimization of one member of a family constitutes victimization of its other members sufficient to warrant a restitution order for the benefit of a victim's family members in their own name."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Other Restitution Statutes", "paragraphs": ["At one time, the lower federal appellate courts are divided over whether under \u00a72259 a restitution order following conviction for possession of child pornography required the government to show that the subject of child pornography has sustained losses proximately caused by the possession offense.

The defendant is obliged to give the officer a complete description of his or her financial situation.", "The probation officer's report is presented to the court, the defendant, and the prosecutor. The court resolves contested restitution issues by a preponderance of the evidence following a hearing, at which the prosecution bears the burden of establishing the existence and extent of the victim's losses, and the defendant bears the burden on questions regarding his or her finances and the extent to which the defendant has compensated the victim for the losses. The court may conduct a hearing or task the probation officer to secure additional information and resolve disputes.", "Section 3664 is precise when it describes how the court must frame the restitution order. The order must envision full compensation for the losses of each victim without regard to the financial circumstances of the defendant. In its calculation of the manner and schedule of payment for each victim, however, the court is to consider the defendant's assets, anticipated future income, and other financial obligations. Compensation may be made in a lump sum, in-kind payments, installments, or any combination of such methods of payment. In-kind payments may take the form of a return of lost property, replacement in-kind or otherwise, or personal services. When the defendant's financial condition precludes any alternative, the order may call for nominal periodic payments. Several courts have emphasized the importance of the court's close attention to the restitution payment schedule by prohibiting sentencing courts from initially ordering that restitution be paid immediately when it is readily apparent that the defendant is unable to do so, thereby effectively leaving the task of establishing a payment schedule to the probation officer or the Bureau of Prisons.", "When it sets the restitution owed by the defendant, the court may not take into account the fact that a victim may have been compensated by insurance or any other alternative form of compensation of his or her injury, loss, or damage. The amount of a restitution order may later be reduced to account for compensatory damages for the same loss recovered in a civil action. ", "When the government and the probation officer have been unable to determine the full extent of victim losses within 10 days of sentencing, they are obligated to inform the court. The court is then to set a date, no later than 90 days after sentencing, for the final determination of victim losses. Thereafter, victims have a limited option to present claims for restitution relating to undiscovered losses.", "The Supreme Court has resolved a circuit split over how these provisions should be applied, particularly in cases where the timelines have not been observed. It held in Dolan that a sentencing court may determine the extent of a victim's losses and order restitution after the expiration of the statutory 90-day deadline, as long as the defendant was aware beforehand that the court intended to order restitution.", "Victims may assign their right to receive restitution payments to Crime Victims Fund, but there is no consensus over whether the court may order restitution to be paid to the Crime Victims Fund on its own initiative if the victim refuses to accept it.", "Should the court determine that more than one defendant contributed to the victim's loss, it may apportion restitution accordingly or it may make the defendants jointly and severally liable. When defendants are made jointly and severally liable, each is liable for the entire amount, but the victim is entitled to no more than what is required to be made whole, regardless of what portion each of the defendants ultimately contributes. ", "There had been a difference of opinion over whether joint and severable liability may be imposed other than with respect to co-defendants. The Supreme Court has recently provided some clarification as to how courts should deal with restitution when those who are not co-defendants are responsible for a substantial portion of the victim's losses. The defendant in the case viewed child pornography of which the victim was the subject. To hold the defendant liable for all of the victim's losses attributable to production, distribution, and viewing of the material might contravene the proscriptions of the Eighth Amendment's excessive fines clause, the Court suggested. Rather, it held that the defendant's restitution order should be calculated to reflect his relative contribution to the harm caused.", "Section 3664(i) declares that when it comes to restitution, the United States is to be served last. The provision is cited most often to confirm that under the appropriate circumstances, the government and its departments and agencies may be considered victims for restitution purposes. When the government is not a victim, the defendant is not entitled to have the restitution award offset by the value of any forfeited property. There may be some question whether the same thing can be said when the government is both the victim of the offense and the recipient of the forfeited property.", "Section 3664(j) permits a court to order restitution to third parties who, as insurers or otherwise, have assumed some or all of the victim's losses, although in such cases, the victim must be fully compensated first. It also permits a court to reduce an earlier restitution order by any amounts that the victim later receives in the course of related federal or state civil litigation.", "The victim, the defendant, or the government may petition to have a restitution order's payment schedule amended to reflect the defendant's changed economic circumstances. The changed economic circumstances envisioned in \u00a73664(k) do not include anticipated future changes or a later, better-informed understanding of the defendant's financial condition at the time of sentence. Nor does the section provide defendants with a mechanism with which to later challenge the legality of their restitution orders.", "There are several means to enforce a restitution order. Section 3664(m) declares that restitution orders may be enforced in the manner used to collect fines or \"by all other available and reasonable means.\" When restitution is a condition of probation or supervised release, failure to make restitution may provide the grounds for revocation. Moreover, a restitution order operates as a lien in the name of the United States on the defendant's property that remains in effect for 20 years. The government may also use garnishment and the other collection mechanisms of the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act (FDCPA) to enforce a restitution order. A victim may use a restitution order to secure a lien in his own name against the defendant's property to ensure the payment of restitution. In addition, the victims' rights provisions of 18 U.S.C. 3771 entitle a victim to \"full and timely restitution as provided in law,\" a right, enforceable in the face of legally insufficient restitution order through a liberalized form of mandamus in some circuits.", "In most instances, a victim may also sue the defendant based on the conduct that led to the conviction and the issuance of the restitution order. During the course of such civil litigation, the defendant may be precluded from denying the facts that formed the basis of the conviction.", "Section 3664(o) provides that the court's restitution order constitutes a final order notwithstanding the fact it may later be corrected, modified, or appealed under various court rules and statutory provisions. This does not mean that the district court may later reduce a restitution order in the absence of specific authority. Nor does it convey appellate rights upon third parties who claim a right to restitution for expenses necessarily incurred on behalf of a victim.
