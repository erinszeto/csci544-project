However, when the President declares a major disaster, individuals who would typically be ineligible for UC (or who have exhausted UC benefits) may be eligible for DUA. In some cases, UC beneficiaries who had an entitlement to UC benefits of fewer than 26 weeks and who had become unemployed as a direct result of a disaster and exhaust their weeks of UC entitlement may be entitled to some DUA benefits.

In general, when the balance of the DRF has become low, additional funding has previously been provided through annual and/or supplemental appropriations to replenish the account.

Although DOL issued the new clarifying rule in the wake of the September 11, 2001, disasters, the rule applies to any subsequently declared major disasters. The rule is intended to make clear a distinction between those individuals unemployed as an immediate result of the disaster itself, and those whose unemployment may have been caused by a long chain of events initiated by the disaster.
