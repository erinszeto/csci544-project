The agency is authorized to conduct land exchanges under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) of 1976. Additionally, Congress sometimes enacts legislation authorizing and governing specific land exchanges.", "FLPMA governs how administrative exchanges are to occur. For instance, land exchanges must be in the public interest, and the federal and nonfederal lands in the exchange are to be in the same state. Further, the values of the lands exchanged are to be equal, although payments to equalize value may be made under specified terms. Typically, BLM and the other parties share equally in the administrative costs. While some exchanges involve single parcels, assembled land exchanges consist of a consolidation of multiple parcels for one or more exchanges over time. Lands acquired by BLM by exchange become public lands managed under existing authorities.", "The land exchange process generally has five phases: development of an exchange proposal, feasibility evaluation, processing and documentation, decision analysis and approval, and title transfer. Each phase typically involves multiple actions. For example, processing and documentation includes title review; public notice and comment; identification and resolution of environmental issues; assessments of mineral, cultural, and other resources; Native American consultations; threatened and endangered species consultations; and preparation of land appraisals. The appraisal and environmental analysis often are the most challenging and time-consuming parts of the process. Legislated exchanges generally follow this process as well, unless otherwise directed by Congress.", "In the past, some BLM land exchanges were controversial. Concerns during the 2000-2009 decade centered on benefits to the public, determinations of market value, contradictions in policies and procedures, delays in appraisals, and various aspects of the exchange process. These topics were the subject of various governmental and nongovernmental reports, for instance by the Government Accountability Office (2000, 2006, and 2009), the Appraisal Foundation (2002), Interior appropriators (2009), and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of the Interior (DOI, 2009). In response, BLM and DOI implemented changes to the appraisal and exchange processes. For instance, BLM formed and adopted the recommendations of the Appraisal and Exchange Workgroup. Later, BLM also issued instruction memoranda on land exchanges containing additional policies and guidance. As another example, the Secretary of the Interior changed the organization and operation of the appraisal services function.", "A key issue for Congress is the extent to which the reforms to the exchange process and appraisal function addressed perceived problems and improved land transactions. Other issues for Congress are whether to amend BLM's exchange authority or to discontinue BLM's administrative exchanges. Opponents of exchanges view them as inherently difficult and thus favor other authorities to sell or exchange land.

Also, provisions of law limiting exchanges to lands in the same state can be too restrictive to accomplish desirable land swaps. Further, other agency authorities providing for either land sale or land acquisition can be more flexible tools for meeting land consolidation and management needs. ", "BLM land exchanges sometimes have been controversial. Federal audits performed over the last decade (2000-2009) criticized some exchanges for short-changing the public. For instance, audits concluded that in some cases BLM did not demonstrate that the public value of the lands acquired at least matched the public value of the land disposed of. In other cases, audits found that there were political pressures to change or ignore determinations of market value to facilitate the exchange. Audits were performed by GAO, the DOI Office of Inspector General (OIG), and the Appraisal Foundation (TAF). These audits received significant attention from Congress, DOI, the media, and interest groups.

These factors include better federal land management and the needs of state and local people for economic, community, and recreation purposes. BLM often trades land to achieve better federal land management, for instance, by consolidating ownership and disposing of land that is isolated or difficult to manage. Under BLM regulations, considerations include protection of fish and wildlife habitat, cultural resources, watersheds, wilderness, and aesthetic values; enhancement of recreational opportunities and public access; consolidation of lands to improve development; and expansion of communities. Also, the Secretary must find that the resource values and public benefits of the federal lands to be conveyed are not more than those of the nonfederal lands being acquired.

Congress continues to oversee agency processes as reformed in recent years and the underlying authorities, through authorizing and appropriating committees. ", "Despite the reforms implemented by BLM and DOI, continuing questions include whether to amend the FLPMA exchange authority or to discontinue exchanges. Critics assert that administrative exchanges are inherently difficult and that this difficulty has contributed to a decrease in exchanges over the past quarter century. Some seek to facilitate exchanges through changes to requirements pertaining to equal value, same state, appraisal processes, and NEPA analyses, among others. ", "Others have suggested ending exchanges in favor of existing authorities to buy and sell land for cash, such as those provided under other provisions of FLPMA. With cash sales, agencies could sell unwanted parcels and use the cash to buy parcels they prefer. Exchange critics believe that this approach takes the subjectivity out of estimating value through appraisal, procures the best price, and simplifies transactions because there is no requirement to equalize value or act within the same state.", "Still other observers assert that renewal of authority allowing BLM to sell or exchange land and keep the money in a special account for subsequent acquisitions would be preferable to exchanges under FLPMA. One such authority was contained in the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act. This law, which expired in 2010 and was extended for one year (through July 25, 2011), provided for the sale or exchange of land identified for disposal under BLM's land-use plans. The proceeds were available to acquire certain lands containing exceptional resources. A similar current authority, the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act, is more limited. It allows BLM to sell or exchange land around Las Vegas, with proceeds available to acquire environmentally sensitive lands in Nevada (as well as for other purposes in Nevada). Advocates prefer these authorities because land values can be determined through the market and agencies can purchase lands independent of annual appropriations.", "BLM, among others, supports exchanging land under FLPMA for the many uses noted above under \" Pros and Cons of Land Exchanges .\" Exchange supporters contend that controversies over valuing properties with unique attributes or in high-growth areas are as likely to occur for land that is sold or acquired under other authorities as for land that is exchanged under FLPMA. Further, BLM asserts that the majority of exchanges are not controversial. Exchange proponents also contend that for many years BLM has had limited funding for purchasing land and that BLM thus needs exchange authority to acquire additional valuable land. By equalizing value by adding or removing land parcels, BLM typically does not spend money for land exchanges. Finally, exchange proponents believe that past reforms have addressed concerns with exchanges and appraisals."], "subsections": []}]}}
