In short, the state must provide evidence that the SAT or ACT (1) is aligned with and equivalent to the state's academic content standards; (2) provides comparable, valid, and reliable data compared to the state assessment; (3) meets the general requirements of assessment systems with the exception that it need not be administered to all students in the state; and (4) provides unbiased, rational, and consistent differentiation between schools within the state. While the use of the SAT or ACT is a potentially viable option, the alignment evidence that must be collected and submitted to ED may be a barrier to implementing the flexibility. ", "In March 2016, the SAT administered a newly redesigned assessment, which made a more focused effort to align itself with the Common Core Academic Standards. If there is a high degree of alignment between a state's academic content standards and the Common Core Academic Standards, the SAT may be suitable for use in accountability systems (provided the SAT meets the other requirements). The ACT was redesigned prior to the development of the Common Core Academic Standards; however, a representative from the ACT maintains that there is \"significant overlap\" between the common core and the college- and career-readiness constructs measured by the ACT. An Education Week survey of the states found that 25 require students to take the SAT or ACT, and 12 currently use the SAT or ACT for federal reporting and statewide accountability systems. ", "If the SAT or ACT is not already used by the state in its accountability system, an LEA may request the use of a locally selected high school assessment (such as the SAT, ACT, Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate exams, ACCUPLACER, or the ASVAB). The locally selected high school assessment must be approved by the state before an LEA uses it for accountability purposes. An Education Week article cites several reasons why states may not be adopting this flexibility more quickly, including the requirements that a state (1) figure out how to pay for the flexibility, (2) design a process for districts to apply for the flexibility, and (3) collect evidence that compares data from the statewide assessment and the locally selected high school assessment. Furthermore, an assessment expert explains in the article that it is difficult to have this flexibility and a comparable accountability system. By allowing the flexibility, states are opening the door to LEAs requesting different assessments from one year to the next. While the locally selected high school assessment must be comparable to the statewide assessment, it will not overlap 100% with the statewide assessment. If assessments continue to change from one year to the next, it may be more difficult to compare results across assessments and track progress over time than if only one assessment was allowed.", "Some states have applied for waivers of the locally selected high school assessments requirements. In one case, a state requested a waiver because an LEA requested to administer the ACT in lieu of the high school assessment before the state approval process was completed.

States have been transitioning away from AA-MAS since around 2014.
