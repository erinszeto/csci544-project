{"id": "RL34137", "title": "The Role of National Oil Companies in the International Oil Market", "released_date": "2007-08-21T00:00:00", "summary": ["In the United States, the term \"big oil companies\" is likely to be taken to mean the major private international oil companies, largely based in Europe or America. However, while some of those companies are indeed among the largest in the world, by many important measures, a majority of the largest oil companies are state-owned, national oil companies. By conventional definitions, national oil companies hold the majority of petroleum reserves and produce the majority of the world's supply of crude oil. Since national oil companies generally hold exclusive rights to exploration and development of petroleum resources within the home country, they also can decide on the degree to which they require participation by private companies in those activities.", "The national oil companies typically do not operate strictly on the basis of market principles. Because of their close ties to the national government, in many cases their objectives might include wealth re-distribution, jobs creation, general economic development, economic and energy security, and vertical integration. Although these objectives might be desirable from the point of view of the nation's government, they are unlikely to be equivalent to the maximization of shareholder value, the stated objective of the private international oil companies.", "Differing objectives might be considered to be important only if they lead to different characteristics and outcomes, which is the case for the national oil companies. Many of these companies have been found to be inefficient, with relatively low investment rates. They tend to exploit oil reserves for short-term gain, possibly damaging oil fields, reducing the longer term production potential. Some also have limited access to international capital markets because of poor business practices and a lack of transparency in their business deals. High oil prices since late 2003 have masked the effect of some of these characteristics in the flow of oil revenues. However, if the price of oil moderates, the potential supply constraint related to the inefficient operations of the national oil companies may be a destabilizing factor in the world oil market.", "A wide variety of policy directions can be taken to mitigate the potential challenge posed by the dominance of national oil companies. Demand management policy can reduce the U.S. dependence on imports. The U.S. government can use its political influence to try to encourage nations not to use national oil companies to forward the aims of the government, but to follow commercial practices to maximize revenue flows. An expanded supply of oil could be encouraged as a condition for trade and aid agreements in some cases. Finally, promoting international trade and recognized commercial practices could be encouraged."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["In June 2007, ExxonMobil Corporation and ConocoPhillips, two of the largest U.S. oil companies, abandoned their multi-billion dollar investments in the heavy oil deposits of the Orinoco basin in Venezuela. This action followed the breakdown of negotiations between the companies and the government of President Hugo Chavez and Petroleos de Venezuela (PDV), the Venezuelan national oil company. Four other international oil companies, including Total SA from France, Statoil from Norway, BP from Great Britain, and Chevron from the United States, accepted agreements that raised the PDV share in their Orinoco projects from approximately 40% to a controlling interest of about 78%.", "ConocoPhillips, especially, was adversely affected by the decision. ConocoPhillips recorded 1.1 billion barrels of proved reserves from its Venezuelan ventures. This amounted to approximately 10% of the company's total reserve holdings, and its production from Venezuela amounted to 4% of its total crude oil production. Although ConocoPhillips continues to negotiate compensation for its holdings, the company took a $4.5 billion dollar write-off against second-quarter 2007 earnings. The company was seen as less likely to be able to meet its reserve replacement targets and the price of its shares fell on the stock market.", "On the Venezuelan side, PDV expanded its reserve and production position, and its strength in the international oil market. Venezuela, traditionally, has a large share of crude oil imports into the United States. This oil flow is now more directly under the control of the Venezuelan government which may or may not allow the flow of crude oil to follow economic market forces.", "This report assesses the position of national oil companies, and how their evolving strength may affect the availability of supply in the oil market, and hence, oil security. The report also examines the effects of national oil company expansion on the major private international oil companies as well as how these companies might differ in motivation and results. Policy options to deal with the rise of national oil companies by the countries without them are also evaluated."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Market Position of National Oil Companies4", "paragraphs": ["Rankings of companies can be accomplished using a number of different criteria. In the oil industry, based as it is on current production to generate current earnings and on reserve positions to ensure the future viability of the enterprise, several standards need to be applied to assess the evolving nature of the companies in the industry. Additionally, investment, in the form of exploration and development expenditures, serves as a link between the present and the future, ensuring an ongoing continuity for the company so that reserves are not unduly depleted by current activities.", "Consumers also have an interest in the structure and size of firms and their activities if the current production level, as well as the proved reserve position of the companies or industry, is declining. If current production declines in the face of growing world demand, it is likely that prices will rise, and the possibility of physical shortages will be heightened. If exploration and development expenditures are reduced because of problems encountered by some firms in accessing international capital markets, the relative scarcity of oil might increase, leading to higher future prices, as well as potentially restricted supply.", " Table 1 shows a ranking of the top 10 world oil companies on the basis of a composite criterion. In 2006, five of the top 10 companies could be classified as state owned and operated. In 2000, six of the top 10 companies were state owned and operated. On the surface, these rankings appear to show a decline in the importance of state-owned firms in the world oil market. However, these rankings may give an unclear picture of the underlying relative strengths of the private and state-owned companies in the world oil market.", " Table 2 shows the leading firms in terms of world-wide petroleum liquids reserves.", "Every firm in the top 10 reserve holders, with the exception of Lukoil, in both 2006 and 2000 was state owned. Among the major international oil companies, ExxonMobil is ranked fourteenth, BP seventeenth, Chevron nineteenth, ConocoPhillips, twenty-third, and Shell is ranked twenty-fifth in 2006. These five firms hold only 3.8% of world liquid reserves, and their major holdings are in the United States and Canada. In contrast, the top 10 firms listed in Table 2 hold 80.6% of the total world liquid reserves. The top 10 companies in 2006 in Table 2 have an average reserve to production ratio of 78 years, with INOC, the Iraqi National Oil Company, the highest at 173 years and Lukoil, a privately held Russian company, the lowest at 24 years. The five large international oil companies have reserve to production ratios of 11 years.", "These values suggest that the 10 largest reserve holding companies, largely state owned, will be major forces in the world oil market about seven times as long as the five major international oil companies. In a market where reserve position is likely to translate into production and pricing power, the state oil companies are in a dominant position, and the international oil companies are likely to continue to play a lesser role. It is also not likely that the reserve positions of the companies will change in favor of the international oil companies in the future. As nations establish their own national oil companies, territories open for exploration and development by private companies may diminish. As suggested by the example of Venezuela, cited in the opening section of this report, even in countries where there are partnerships between the private oil companies and national oil companies, if there is any revision of ownership shares, it is likely to be in favor of the national oil companies. Two factors affect this observation. Oil-producing nations seem to be displaying an ever more nationalistic attitude toward their natural resource endowments, and the national oil companies are viewed as custodians of that resource. If there is opposition to U.S. foreign policy objectives, or if there is a more general negative reaction to the spread of global markets and private industry, nationalization of oil resources and transference to the national oil company is likely one of the most direct ways to make a political statement. Given the tight balance between global supply and demand, this statement can be made with little or no cost in lost revenues.", " Table 3 shows the 10 leading producing companies in the world. A company's ability to produce crude oil depends on access to oil deposits, but it also depends on access to modern technology. The private international oil companies generally have access to state-of-the-art technologies, which are less easily available to some other firms. Gaining access to the best technology for exploration, development, and production is one of the key motivations oil producing nations have for entering production-sharing agreements with the private international oil companies.", "In 2006, seven of the top 10 producing companies were state owned, including the five largest producers. Although the three largest international oil companies were among the top 10 producers, and two of them, BP and ExxonMobil, even managed to increase their total output, their production was from relatively small reserve bases, shortening the time they can remain in the market as producers without major new discoveries. The effects of rising world demand and higher prices since 2003 can be seen in the increased output of most of the companies on the list.", "One final factor in the power of the national oil companies should be noted. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) allows these companies to compete to a degree they deem compatible with their national goals as specified by their governments and still coordinate their actions through OPEC when it is in their interests to show a more unified front in the world market. This ability to compete or coordinate their activities and decisions when it is in their, and their nations', interests is not available to the private international oil companies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives and Characteristics of National Oil Companies", "paragraphs": ["The reserve and production positions of the national oil companies might be little cause for concern if the companies operated much like the private international oil companies, and state ownership was only a matter of how the stock shares of the company were held. However, it is likely that the objectives for many national oil companies, as well as the characteristics of their operations, differ from companies in the private sector of the oil industry."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Objectives", "paragraphs": ["Privately held companies have the goal of maximizing shareholder value. The management of the company may accomplish that goal through organizing production so that a profit is made in the current time frame as well as in the future. They also might make investment decisions to take advantage of opportunities to raise the company's rate of return. They also have the motivation to achieve productive efficiency to hold down costs to enhance the profitability of any given revenue level. This activity is thought to benefit consumers by assuring that physical shortages are avoided and that the good is available at the lowest price consistent with demand and supply factors.", "In the oil industry, maximization of shareholder value is taken to mean that the value of oil resources should be maximized through managing production, exploration, and development activities to assure a functioning market. To ensure the long-term viability of the company, reserve replacement is necessary. For the company to grow, it must have the ability to expand production and sales to meet demand growth in newly developing economies as well as in developed areas. Technical efficiency in all parts of the supply chain leads to cost minimization as well as improvements in product performance and environmental integrity.", "National oil companies do not necessarily follow the shareholder value maximization model alone. Since these companies are totally, or majority, owned by their national governments, maximizing the value of the company might have to compete with other, governmentally mandated objectives. Although all national oil companies respond to their national governments to one degree or another, the amount of influence varies widely. The national oil companies of more developed nations, Statoil in Norway, and Petronas in Malaysia, for example, tend to follow a more commercially oriented strategy than the Nigerian National Petroleum Co. and Petroleos de Venezuela, where government objectives largely supplant commercial objectives, and the companies are under pressure to maximize the flow of funds to the national treasuries."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Wealth Distribution", "paragraphs": ["National oil companies may be involved in redistributing the oil wealth of the nation to the society in general. This redistribution can be accomplished through fuel subsidies, employment policies, and social welfare programs among other programs. Fuel subsidies are common, reducing the price of gasoline in Venezuela to $0.11 per gallon, $0.21 per gallon in Iran, and $0.64 per gallon in Saudi Arabia. In contrast, gasoline had an average price of $5.77 in Norway, one of the higher observed price levels in the world. While subsidized fuel prices reduce energy prices to the general population, enhance industrial and transportation resources, and protect the domestic economy from the damaging effects of volatile world petroleum prices, the downside is that they are very expensive in terms of lost potential revenues for the national oil company. The artificially low price encourages demand growth, corruption, inefficient use of fuels, and even arbitrage-based smuggling schemes. The expanded use of fuels domestically leads to reduced exports and tightens supply in world markets, leading to higher prices in the oil-importing countries. Examples of subsidy programs with these effects include those observed in Iran, Nigeria, and Indonesia among others."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Jobs Programs", "paragraphs": ["Although the results vary with the demographic of the country, national oil companies can be viewed as jobs programs for the domestic economy. Table 4 shows that private oil companies have varying levels of employment for each one million barrels of oil equivalent produced, but the degree of variation is higher for the national oil companies. The data shows Saudi Aramco with the lowest ratio of employees to oil produced. The low ratio may be the result of efficiency within the organization, the large quantities of oil produced, or it may reflect the small population and overall wealth of Saudi Arabia that minimizes the need for a jobs program. The two Chinese national oil companies, CNOOC and PetroChina, are near the lowest and also the highest in terms of number of employees per barrel of oil equivalent produced. This outcome is likely the result of different operational requirements, or different treatment of the companies by the government. The Russian based-companies are also near the highest jobs producers, perhaps reflecting policies still in place from the old Soviet Union, or inefficient technologies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Economic Development", "paragraphs": ["National oil companies are also used by their governments as tools in the overall process of economic development.

The industry may serve as a conduit for technology transfers to the larger economy. Local content rules may be imposed to ensure the development of ancillary service businesses to spread development dollars. The national oil company may also be required to supply subsidized fuels to industries targeted in the nations' development plans.", "An example of the development responsibilities of a national oil company is in Kazakhstan, where KMG has clearly stated its aims.

For example, Saudi Aramco's decision to raise oil output in the wake of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and China's oil-based relationships with Iran, Venezuela, Russia, and others can be viewed as partly politically motivated.", "Perhaps the most recent and assertive example of national oil companies being tied to the geopolitical aims of their government is PDVSA and President Chavez and his Bolivarian Revolution. Some believe that Chavez sees the United States and its promotion of democracy and global markets as a threat to his revolution. To counter what Chavez sees as U.S. expansionism, he is using the promise of economic aid, joint energy projects, and favorable oil pricing to gain influence in Latin America, the Caribbean, and other areas. PDVSA plays an important role in these policies.

Security on the demand side means not allowing one consumer to become critical to the national oil company. For example, PDVSA has recently tried to direct its oil sales away from the United States in the hope of reducing U.S. economic influence, and as a way to develop other consuming markets for Venezuelan crude oil. However, in some cases technological factors make this strategy difficult. A long-standing relationship between an oil exporter and importer may lead to the investment in more-or-less specialized facilities that facilitate the use of the exporting nation's oil. In the United States-Venezuela case, Venezuela produces relatively heavy crude oils, especially from the Orinoco basin projects. The United States has refineries designed to use this crude oil. As Venezuela seeks to diversify its customer base, it must find locations with refinery capacity suited to its crude oil.", "In other cases, energy security objectives for national oil companies are defined in terms of security of supply. Supply security objectives in the well-functioning world oil market are usually defined in terms of the diversity of producers and the security of oil supply lanes. For some countries and their national oil companies, oil supply security means the ownership, or exclusive rights to, desired supplies of oil. Some analysts have identified China as a nation following this type of strategy.

On an economic level, vertical integration allows the national oil company to capture the value added from producing and selling petroleum products.

In addition, demand security was enhanced through gaining a position in the large U.S. gasoline market. In other cases, national oil companies might be able to gain access to markets otherwise not available to them. The national oil companies may also be able to achieve a greater degree of diversification and mitigation of risk through vertical integration. Oil prices have tended to be volatile.

Model 1 is the basic model that views revenue as the output of the firm and uses gas reserves, oil reserves, and number of employees as the productive inputs. An estimated efficiency value of 1.0 is the highest score and 0.0 is the lowest score.

The five major international oil companies' (ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips) average score was 0.73, and the average for the national oil companies in the sample was 0.27.", "Efficiency in producing revenues, as defined in EHM, is likely affected by the national oil companies' objectives that in general include a greater range of motivating factors than value maximization. Subsidized sales and wealth distribution are unlikely to be favorable to maximizing revenues, and in fact, when adjusted for degree of vertical integration and government share of revenues, most of the apparent inefficiency of Saudi Aramco, PDVSA, and Pemex is explained. NIOC and PetroChina retain efficiency scores near the bottom of the sampled firms even with the specified adjustments. The addition of vertical integration and government share as explanatory variables suggest that the former is a desirable goal for national oil companies, and the latter suggests that the national oil companies would be more profitable without government participation. However, that outcome is unlikely.", "Inefficiency is a problem not only for the national oil companies themselves but for the world oil market as a whole. If the most inefficient firms tend to be in control of the majority of the world's exploitable oil reserves and the market demand is projected to expand by approximately 30% by 2030, it would seem more likely that the expansion could be accomplished by more efficient firms.

In the longer term, damage to the world oil market could be enhanced by the dominant position the national oil companies have in terms of potential reserve access.", "For consumers, the national oil companies' focus on current production may work to keep the world price of oil relatively lower in the near term. However, if the national oil companies ignore investment in exploration and development, it could mean higher oil prices in the future. Some estimates of the needs for oil industry investment total $16 trillion over 30 years. If the national oil companies do not undertake investment on this scale, and if they and their governments exclude the international oil companies from developing reserves in their countries, the world oil market could be supply-constrained in the future, and prices might be higher than if higher investment took place.", " Table 6 shows the top 10 companies with respect to upstream, or exploration, development, and production, capital expenditures (Capex). Eight of the top 10 companies are private, or in the case of Petrobras from Brazil, 68% privately held.

The eight private oil companies account for 75% of the total of $94.5 billion invested upstream by the top 10 companies.

The international oil companies may not have access to what they consider to be favorable prospects. Beyond the restricted access to potential reserve areas around the world, it may be that large companies have expertise in developing and operating large fields, a type of oil deposit in diminishing availability. In this sense, there may be a mismatch between the capabilities of the companies and the reserves to which they have access. The price of oil is volatile over time. As a result, a conservative investment policy, based on an expected price, not necessarily fully reflecting high current prices, might be in the companies' interest. The international oil companies may be making investment decisions on the basis of a future market price of oil lower than the current price, leading to lower levels of investment. Tight markets in trained manpower, specialized equipment, and materials likely leads to higher project costs as well as delays that may make investments less attractive. The private firms may be under financial market pressure to generate current returns. Upstream capital expenditure is a long-term investment that likely reduces current dividend pay-outs while using large amounts of current income.
