The United States defines direct investment as the ownership of at least 10% of the voting securities of an incorporated business enterprise or the equivalent interest in an unincorporated business enterprise. The U.S. \"international investment position\" or \"stock\" of FDI is the cumulative amount at a given point in time, while the flow of FDI measures its movement for a particular period of time, such as for a year.

Global FDI inflows increased by 9% to reach nearly $1.5 trillion in 2013, though remaining below pre-2008 financial crisis levels ( Figure 1 ). According to preliminary estimates, global FDI inflows decreased to $1.26 trillion in 2014. Historically, developed countries have been the primary sources of global direct investment. In recent years, emerging market and developing economies have played an increasing role in global investment. In 2010, these economies accounted for the more than 50% of global FDI inflows for the first time. While FDI generally has flowed from capital-exporting, developed countries to developing countries, \"South-South\" investment flows are growing. FDI flows can fluctuate broadly on a year to year basis, associated with changes in global economic conditions, the impact of certain business deals, and other factors. As such, the U.S. position as the leading recipient of direct investment flows has been overtaken in some years. According to preliminary estimates, in 2014, the U.S. position as a recipient of inward direct investment dropped to third largest ($86 billion), after China ($128 billion) and Hong Kong ($111 billion).", "In 2013, the stock of U.S. direct investment abroad totaled $4.7 trillion, with Europe and Latin America ranking as the first and second largest recipients.

In general, U.S. firms invest abroad to serve the foreign local market, rather than to produce goods to export back to the United States, although some firms establish overseas operations to replace U.S. exports or production, or to gain access to raw materials, less expensive labor, or other markets. Foreign companies may choose to invest in the United States, for instance, to access U.S. skills, resources, and the U.S. consumer market. Both U.S. inward and outward direct investment play a role in U.S. trade, jobs, and production. In 2011, the affiliates of foreign firms in the United States employed about 6.3 million workers, exported $343 billion in goods, and imported $677 billion in goods.", "Investment gives rise to inter- and intra-firm trade, which represents trade between U.S. parent companies and their foreign affiliates and U.S. affiliates of foreign firms and their foreign parent company. The rapid pace of globalization in recent years has led to the creation of diverse international supply and value chains, where goods are transformed from basic components to end-use consumer products, often crossing the borders of multiple countries in the process. Thus, for example, exports by U.S. parent companies to their foreign affiliates include not only exports for resale without further manufacture, but also exports for further manufacturing. ", "U.S. Department of Commerce data indicate that the value of exports shipped by U.S. parent companies was $738 billion in 2012, which accounted for 47% of total U.S. exports of $1.6 trillion. Similarly, the U.S. affiliates of foreign parent companies exported $334 billion in 2012, or 21% of total U.S. exports. Also, U.S. parent companies accounted for 41% of U.S. imports, or $ 949 billion, and the U.S. affiliates of foreign firms accounted for 29% of U.S. imports. Intra-firm trade, or trade between parent companies and their affiliates accounted for 29% of total U.S. goods exports and 34% of total U.S. goods imports. Intra-firm trade between U.S. parent firms and their foreign affiliates accounted for 18% of U.S. exports and 13% of U.S. imports, while trade between the U.S. affiliates of foreign firms and their foreign parent companies accounted for 10% of U.S. exports and 21% of U.S. imports.

For the United States, the primary forms of IIAs are bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and BIT-like investment chapters in regional and bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs). Investment chapters in U.S. FTAs generally resemble investment provisions in U.S. BITs.

These barriers may include economic and political instability; economic policies and measures that limit growth (such as capital controls, exchange rate controls, tax and regulatory policies); expropriation and nationalization of private property; weak, underdeveloped, or overly bureaucratic institutions; corruption and lack of transparency; non-independent judicial systems, and limited infrastructure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What is the U.S. policy on IIAs?", "paragraphs": ["The United States' dual role as both a major source and recipient of direct investment shapes its investment policy and generally supports an open investment climate consistent with national security.

U.S. commitments in IIAs also provide national security exceptions.", "In addition to negotiating IIAs, the United States conducts other activities related to facilitating U.S. investment abroad. For example, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) provides political risk insurance, financing, and other services to U.S. investors to mitigate the risks of investing in developing and emerging countries. With respect to national security, the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) serves the President by overseeing the national security implications of foreign investment in the economy by reviewing proposed foreign investment transactions in the United States. The President has the authority to block proposed or pending foreign investment transactions that threaten to impair the national security.

In 2011, President Obama issued a statement reaffirming the United States' \"open investment policy,\" which is a \"commitment to treat all investors in a fair and equitable manner under the law.\" The Department of Commerce's SelectUSA program is intended to coordinate federal efforts to attract and retain investment in the United States, complementing states' investment promotion activities.

By the mid-1960s, several European countries had initiated BIT programs. Asian nations began to sign BITs in the 1970s; Japan signed its first BIT in 1977 with Egypt. The United States subsequently initiated its BIT program in 1977.

Prior to the 2004 changes, the United States negotiated BITs on a 1994 Model BIT based largely on the investment chapter in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The 2004 Model BIT changes primarily related to U.S. concerns that the types of protection granted to foreign investors by NAFTA may have been written too broadly, and that foreign investors would possibly receive more favorable treatment for their NAFTA-related investor-state dispute claims than U.S. investors would under U.S. law. ", "To address these concerns, the U.S. government made several changes in the 2004 Model BIT in order to give the BIT parties greater control over the arbitral process and to limit access to ISDS. These changes were reaffirmed in recent agreements and the 2012 Model BIT. Post-NAFTA U.S. investment provisions in BITs and FTAs incorporated a principal trade negotiating objective from the 2002 Trade Promotion Authority stipulating that no trade agreement is to lead to foreign investors in the United States being granted greater substantive rights than what are granted to U.S. investors in the United States (see below section on core provisions). Additionally, the 2004 model and subsequent investment treaty chapters now provide more detailed guidance for both parties and tribunals and also address procedural and other matters not included in earlier U.S. investment treaties, such as the expedited review of claims, rules on frivolous claims, the participation of non-disputing third parties in the arbitration, a statute of limitations, and the consolidation of related claims.
