Jamie Dimon, CEO and chairman of JP Morgan, reported that the bank's Chief Investment Office (CIO) executed the trades to hedge the firm's overall credit exposure as part of the bank's asset liability management program (ALM). The CIO operated within the depository subsidiary of JP Morgan, although its offices were in London. The funding for the trades came from what JP Morgan characterized as excess deposits, which are the difference between deposits held by the bank and its commercial loans.", "The trading losses resulted from an attempt to unwind a previous hedge investment, although the precise details remain unconfirmed. The losses occurred in part because the CIO chose to place a new counter-hedge position, rather than simply unwind the original position. In 2007 and 2008, JP Morgan had bought an index tied to credit default swaps on a broad index of high-grade corporate bonds. In general, this index would tend to protect JP Morgan if general economic conditions worsened (or systemic risk increased) because the perceived health of high-grade firms would tend to deteriorate with the economy. In 2011, the CIO decided to change the firm's position by implementing a new counter trade. Because this new trade was not identical to the earlier trades, it introduced basis risk and market risk, among other potential problems. It is this second \"hedge on a hedge\" that is responsible for the losses in 2012.", "Several financial regulators are responsible for overseeing elements of the JP Morgan trading losses. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is the primary prudential regulator of federally chartered depository banks and their ALM activities, including the CIO of JP Morgan, even though it is located in London. The Federal Reserve is the prudential regulator of JP Morgan's holding company, although it would tend to defer to the primary prudential regulators of the firm's subsidiaries for significant regulation of those entities. The Federal Reserve also regulates systemic risk aspects of large financial firms such as JP Morgan. The CIO must comply with Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) regulations because it is part of the insured depository. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversees JP Morgan's required disclosures to the firm's stockholders regarding material risks and losses such as the trades. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulates trading in swaps and financial derivatives. The heads of these agencies coordinate through the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which is chaired by the Secretary of Treasury.", "The trading losses may have implications for a number of financial regulatory issues. For example, should the exemption to the Volcker Rule for hedging be interpreted broadly enough to encompass general portfolio hedges like the JP Morgan trades, or should hedging be limited to more specific risks? Are current regulations of large financial firms the appropriate balance to address perceptions that some firms are too-big-to-fail?", "The trading losses raise concerns about the calculation and reporting of risk by large financial firms. JP Morgan changed its value at risk (VaR) model during the time of the trading losses. Some are concerned that VaR models may not adequately address potential risks. Some are concerned that the change in reporting of the VaR at JP Morgan's CIO may not have provided adequate disclosures of the potential risks that JP Morgan faced. Such disclosures are governed by securities laws."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["JP Morgan Chase (JP Morgan), the nation's largest bank holding company by asset size, had established a reputation for quality risk management. On May 10, 2012, Jamie Dimon, the bank's chairman and chief executive officer (CEO), held an unplanned conference call. As reflected in the firm's first quarter 2012 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Mr. Dimon reported that, during the early part of the second quarter, a London-based office of the bank (insured depository) unit, the Chief Investment Office (CIO), sought \"to hedge the firm's overall credit exposure\" and incurred \"slightly more than [a] $2 billion trading [paper] loss on \u2026 synthetic credit positions.\" The CEO characterized the trading strategy behind the loss as \"flawed, complex, poorly reviewed, poorly executed and poorly monitored [and noted that] the portfolio has proven to be riskier, more volatile and less effective as economic hedge than we thought.\" He also said that the portfolio still contained securities with \"a lot of risk and volatility going forward.... It could cost us as much as $1 billion or more\u2026. [I]t is risky, and it will be for a couple of quarters.\"", "The loss was charged to the bank's corporate and private equity division, which houses the CIO. During the conference call, Mr. Dimon also indicated that the loss would be partially offset by a $1 billion gain from the sale of securities by the unit, resulting in an $800 million second quarter loss for the division.", "The May conference call occurred several weeks after a routine April 13, 2012, conference call in which Mr. Dimon reported on the bank's first-quarter earnings. During the April call, he referred to concerns raised over the bank's exposure to the money-losing trades (which he derided in the May call) as \"a complete tempest in a teapot.\"", "The losses described in the May conference call were mark-to-market paper losses that had not been booked by the bank. While some analysts speculated that JP Morgan would not lose much more than the $2 billion, others speculated that the bank would ultimately lose as much as $5\u00a0billion or more. Final losses will depend on various unknowns, such as the proportion of the suspect trades that have not been liquidated or unwound, future movements of the indexes, the speed at which the bank tries to unwind those trades, and the size of the subsequent losses from the remaining positions. During the May conference call, Mr. Dimon said that the bank would be unwinding the trades in a deliberate manner.", "During a subsequent conference call on July 13, 2012, bank officials detailed key developments during the second quarter of 2012. During the call, Mr. Dimon indicated, with respect to the suspect trades, the CIO lost $1.6 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, during the first and second quarters of 2012. Mr. Dimon also indicated that the CIO's total trading risk in the trades had been \"significantly reduced.\"", "JP Morgan's shareholders have borne and will bear the impact of losses. The day after the May conference call, JP Morgan's stock price fell by about 9% and the value of its market capitalization fell by about $14 billion. On May 21, 2012, the bank announced that it was suspending a previously planned $15 billion stock buyback that regulators from the Federal Reserve approved in March 2012 after performing stress tests on the bank's capital. At about the same time, the bank decided to maintain its quarterly dividend of $0.30 a share. Buybacks can help boost the price of a company's shares. Since the May conference call, several class action shareholders suits, alleging that the bank misled investors, have also been filed.", "According to news reports, after the conference call, Fitch Ratings, a major credit rating agency, downgraded JP Morgan's short-term and long-term debt by a notch. Both are still categorized as investment grade debt. The reports also indicated that Fitch indicated that the $2 billion loss was \"manageable.\" The rating agency also noted that the size of the loss and the \"ongoing nature of these positions implies a lack of liquidity [and that the loss] also raised questions over JPM's risk appetite, risk management framework, and its practices and oversight.\"", "Several bank analysts have indicated that the report of the losses raised concerns about the quality of JP Morgan's risk management. However, there appears to be general consensus that the losses are relatively small when compared with the size of the bank's overall balance sheet. This view appears to be shared by officials at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the financial regulator that oversees JP Morgan's national bank and various subsidiaries. On June 6, 2012, Comptroller of the Currency Thomas Curry testified that, \"given the scale of the bank, the loss by JPMC affects its earnings, but does not present a solvency issue.\"", "The May conference call had a variety of other ripple effects both inside and outside of JP Morgan. The head of the bank's CIO stepped down. JP Morgan is conducting internal investigations of the losses, which are being overseen by the company's board. One outcome of the probe, T he CIO Task Force Update , was completed in July 2012. Among other things, the report, which described itself as a product of a JP Morgan \"management review and assessment of circumstances surrounding the CIO's losses,\" criticized the CIO for \"ineffective\" risk management and exercising \"poor\" judgment with respect to various trades during the first quarter of 2012.", "Mr. Dimon also indicated that the board of directors would be examining whether bank employees responsible for the losses would be subject to the bank's heretofore unused compensation \"clawback\" policy. The policy enables the bank to require the return of certain compensation given to senior employees, including \"unvested stock\" and \"cash bonuses,\" following actions deemed to be unsatisfactory, including \"bad judgment.\"", "Meanwhile, OCC officials have indicated that the agency is \"evaluating the compensation process of the CIO and will assess the bank's determination on clawbacks as part of that analysis [and] if corrective action is warranted.\"", "Various agencies, including the United Kingdom's financial services regulator (the Financial Services Administration), the SEC, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Federal Reserve (the Fed), the OCC, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), have launched probes of various aspects of the trades.

The JP Morgan of today began as JP Morgan, a commercial bank, in the 19 th century. It has subsequently grown into a diversified financial complex through a series of acquisitions and mergers that have included Chase Manhattan, a commercial bank; Bear Stearns, an investment bank; and the banking operations of Washington Mutual, a thrift institution. In 2011, JP Morgan reported gross profits of about $99 billion and net profits of $19 billion. The bank engages in mortgage lending, credit card issuance, investment banking, and asset management. It is also serves as a primary dealer in U.S. government securities. Overall, the financial services company has several broad business lines: (1) retail financial services, (2) treasury and securities services, (3) card services, (4) investment banking, (5) commercial banking, (6) asset management, and (7) corporate/private equity.", "The Chief Investment Office (CIO) is a part of the corporate/private equity line, which also houses the company's risk management unit, the private-equity arm, and the treasury office. The CIO is tasked with the responsibility of \"managing structural interest rate, currency and certain credit risks that are created from the day-to-day operations of the firm's primary lines of business across the company.\" The unit also \"manages the [JP Morgan] firm's investment exposure while helping to advise lines of business on their own investment strategies [and] is responsible for managing the firm's interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and other structural risks, each of which are critical measures for the firm.\"", "In congressional testimony on June 13, 2012, Mr. Dimon spoke about the CIO's mission and the scope of its activities: ", "Like many banks, we have more deposits than loans\u2014at quarter end, we held approximately $1.1 trillion in deposits and $700 billion in loans. CIO, along with our Treasury unit, invests excess cash in a portfolio that includes Treasuries, agencies, mortgage-backed securities, high quality securities, corporate debt and other domestic and overseas assets. This portfolio serves as an important source of liquidity and maintains an average rating of AA+. It also serves as an important vehicle for managing the assets and liabilities of the consolidated company. In short, the bulk of CIO's responsibility is to manage an approximately $350 billion portfolio.", "Before Jamie Dimon became the bank's CEO, JP Morgan's CIO was not a discrete unit, but was part of the bank's treasury unit. As is the case with bank chief investment offices, bank treasury units are also concerned with asset/liability management.", "Other large banking complexes have functions that are similar to what JP Morgan's CIO does, but many have organized them differently. For example, media accounts indicate that Bank of America has a chief investment officer who reports to the company's chief financial officer (CFO). Citigroup's treasurer is reported to directly oversee a comparable portfolio through his oversight of the bank's chief investment office as well as deputy treasurers in other countries. In addition, according to some reports, at Wells Fargo, the CIO is divided between the CFO and the head of the investment banking and trading division. Citigroup apparently has a centralized office that reports to its treasurer to hedge liability risks for the New York bank, but lacks an individual unit that engages in the kind of macroeconomic hedging that JP Morgan's CIO officially does.", "According to various reports, but unconfirmed by the Congressional Research Service (CRS), a major difference between JP Morgan's CIO and comparable units at other large banks involves the composition of their portfolios. Similar units at other large banks are said to hold smaller proportions of relatively risky instruments than JP Morgan's CIO and tend to have \"financial filings [that indicate] that their holdings are concentrated in low-risk, low-return assets such as Treasuries, government-backed mortgages and corporate and municipal bonds.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Alleged Growth in the CIO's Appetite for Risk", "paragraphs": ["After becoming JP Morgan's CEO in 2005, Jamie Dimon hired Ina Drew, a veteran trader and manager, to head the CIO.

Former JP Morgan employees who worked with Ms. Drew have told reporters that she received the CEO's authorization to ramp up the unit's investments in relatively risky financial products such as asset-backed securities, equities, credit derivatives, and nations' sovereign debt.", "Financial reporting for the bank's corporate/private equity line of business is divided between the private equity side and the corporate side. JP Morgan's CIO and its treasury unit are the only money-making units in the corporate unit. According to the bank's financial disclosures from 2008 to 2011, the corporate unit reported net income of, respectively, $1.2 billion, $3.1 billion, $670 million, and $411 million. During those years, the CIO was widely characterized as a significant \"profit center\" for the bank. According to JP Morgan's financial filings, Ms. Drew earned $15 million in 2010 and $14 million in 2011, making her one of the company's highest paid officials.", "In 2006, Ms. Drew hired Achilles Macris to supervise trading in the CIO in London. Various reports have alleged that, with Mr. Dimon's approval, the London unit expanded into riskier types of derivatives. In 2011, in what some suggest may have reflected aggressive risk taking, Macris is claimed to have halted the use of risk-control caps, which had required traders to exit positions when their losses exceeded $20 million. In June 2012 testimony, Mr. Dimon denied the assertion that the caps were removed. In July 2012, however, a report on the bank's internal probe of the trades, t he CIO Task Force Update , stated that the securities that had caused the CIO's trading losses were subject to \"no limits by size, asset type or risk factor\" for trading in the securities that resulted in the losses.", "According to media reports, in late March 2012, the London unit began experiencing big trading day gains that were often followed by larger losses on the following day. As reported in an article in the New York Times during the period, Mr. Dimon was assured by Ms. Drew and her associates that the volatility was \"manageable.\" According to the reports, extreme trading patterns, but with fewer gains offsetting the losses, reappeared a few days after JP Morgan reported its first quarter financials on April 13, 2012.

These are congressional testimony from JP Morgan's Michael Cavanagh, CEO of the company's Treasury and Securities Services, and from Thomas Curry, Comptroller of the Currency, the head of the OCC, which regulates national banks and had examiners at JP Morgan when the trades occurred.", "Discussing findings in JP Morgan's CIO Task Force Update during a July 12, 2012, conference call, JP Morgan's Cavanagh observed, ", "The [synthetic credit portfolio's] primary purpose had been to provide a partial offset to losses we would suffer elsewhere in CIO, and the Company, in a stressed credit environment. The portfolio got started about five years ago. It was generally short credit. But also included some long positions in order to reduce the cost of carrying credit protection. And consistent with its objective, the portfolio produced gains in the stressed period of 2008 to 2010, and was breakeven or positive from each year from 2007 to 2011, and all-in, it generated about $2 billion in gains during that period\u2026. ", "In late 2011, CIO was directed to reduce the synthetic credit portfolio's risk and risk weighted assets. That direction came as part of the annual budgeting process, in which we develop the firm's capital plans including our glide path to Basel III. [T]he synthetic credit team and CIO hoped to \u2026 move their portfolio's risk position from a net short position to a neutral one, while reducing risk weighted assets in the process. They also hoped to retain some protection against Corporate credit defaults which was a synthetic credit portfolio's historical mission. So a lot of things going on that they were trying to accomplish, and found it difficult to find a balance that they liked. ", "To simplify what they did, it amounted to them going long investment grade indices while increasing short positions in junior tranches in high yield indices. And the size of the portfolio grew dramatically as they continued to add positions later in the quarter, when they were struggling to balance the portfolio, as the market began to move against them. So a question of why they didn't just pursue an outright reduction of the portfolio. And it appears, and that's all it is, an appearance, that they thought about it a bit but they believed that it would be more expensive than the approach they chose, which obviously proved to be wrong, and were focused on thinking about high execution costs to reduce the portfolio in size and the loss carry of a reduced portfolio, and so they went ahead with the approach they had\u2026. ", "[W]hat they did do was [to] increase the size and complexity of the portfolio dramatically in the first quarter [of 2012], and along with it, the sensitivity to a variety of risks \u2026 all of which contributed in some part to the losses\u2026. [With respect to] the growth of the portfolio in the first quarter ... the total notional size of the portfolio ... tripled. [The] significantly increased size and complexity of the portfolio left little margin for error when the expected pricing relationships across the portfolio began to break down and generate losses. It was a very risky approach they took that should have been discussed and vetted at more senior levels but it was not \u2026. ", "\u2026 [The] portfolio experienced losses in late March and early April. Around this time, market visibility of the synthetic credit positions becomes a concern, particularly after press reports on April 6. At that point, Doug and Jamie asked for a review of the portfolio in preparation for the earnings release a few days later. Ina spear-headed the review with engagement by John Hogan, Doug Braunstein, and others. The main output of that review was forward scenario analysis that produced a probable P&L range for the second quarter on the portfolio from positive $350 million to negative $250 million, with a bias to the positive end. So at that time, the group got comfortable that the portfolio's risk was manageable, though in need of heightened attention going forward\u2026. ", "\u2026 On April 13, this period ends and we announce our first-quarter results\u2026. In late April, losses pick up and the heightened monitoring that followed the earnings call gets taken to another level, when a senior team from Corporate Risk is sent to examine the portfolio from the bottom up. They begin providing daily updates and constructing independent analysis of the portfolio that becomes the basis for risk measurements that the new CIO team picks up a few weeks later\u2026.", "According to Comptroller of the Currency Curry,", "In 2007 and 2008, the bank constructed a portfolio designed to partially offset credit risk using credit default swaps to help protect the company from potential credit losses in a stressed global economy\u2026. In late 2011 and early 2012, bank management revised its strategy and decided to offset its original position and reduce the amount of stress loss protection. The instruments chosen by the bank to execute the strategy were not identical to the instruments used in the original position, which introduced basis, liquidity, and other risks.

The act separated commercial banking from investment banking, making them separate lines of commerce. Some have argued that JP Morgan's trading losses offer evidence on the desirability of separating commercial banking from investment banking through Glass-Steagall-like regulation.

The argument is that large banks such as JP Morgan are under pressure to make profits by investing in higher yielding but riskier securities in an environment in which there is muted demand for conventional commercial loans. Many of their potential corporate customers are hoarding their cash. An additional incentive to search for higher yield is said to come from the fact that safe investment alternatives like investment-grade government bonds currently have such low yields that it is hard for banks to profit from the yield spread between them and their deposits. In sum, it is argued that banks such as JP Morgan face heightened pressures to invest in riskier but potentially higher rewarding securities.", "On the other hand, at least two arguments have been advanced to refute the notion that JP Morgan's losses have any bearing on the likelihood of problematic losses at other large banks. One argument is that, time after time, banks' greatest exposure to losses has come from their loan making, not the kinds of trades that appear to have led to JP Morgan's losses.

It prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading or affiliating with certain classes of firms that speculate in financial markets. This is an approach that Chairman Volcker advocated and Senators Merkley and Levin pursued by introducing legislation in March 2010 that contributed to the development of the final language of Section 619.", "Under the conformance regulations, firms are not required to comply with the Volcker Rule until July 21, 2014.

At present, however, there is no final rule implementing the statute. In addition, it could be argued that there is insufficient specific information about the bank's transactions that resulted in the losses to meaningfully address that policy question even if the rules were in place. Also, there are some indications that the proposed rule that was issued by the agencies on November 7, 2011, will continue to evolve. The language of the statute and the proposed regulation, however, provide insight into the multiplicity of details and complexity of documentation that would be required for a banking firm to justify a trade of the magnitude reported for the JP Morgan transactions as a risk-mitigating hedging activity.", "With respect to proprietary trading, Section 619 states that \"[u]nless otherwise provided in [Section 619], a banking entity shall not \u2026 engage in proprietary trading.\" It defines the term banking entity broadly to include bank and financial holding companies and their affiliates. The trades resulting in billions of dollars in losses were executed by a JP Morgan unit that is part of a national bank, and, thus, a banking entity that will be subject to the Volcker Rule's ban on proprietary trading.", "The proposed regulation generally tracks the statutory definition of proprietary trading and defines proprietary trading as \"engaging as principal for the trading account of the covered banking entity in any purchase or sale of one or more covered financial positions. Proprietary trading does not include acting solely as agent, broker, or custodian for an unaffiliated third party.\"", "Section 619's prohibition of proprietary trading attempts to prevent depository banks with access to the taxpayer-assisted safety net from speculating in financial markets. It can be difficult to distinguish a bank speculating for itself from a bank acting on behalf of customers or a bank hedging to improve safety and soundness. Section 619, therefore, provides for a number of exemptions, including but not limited to risk-mitigating hedging, trades in U.S. Treasury securities, market-making, and certain customer-driven services. Application and implementation of Section 619 will ultimately depend upon how financial regulators interpret proprietary trading and its exemptions.", "One of the exemptions provided in Section 619 is for trades that are intended to reduce the risks of the bank.

Among the qualifications are that the banking entity must already be exposed to the risk being hedged, that the hedge not earn appreciably more profits than the firm would lose on the hedged position, and that the hedge be reasonably correlated to the risk being hedged.", "Hedging to mitigate risks in a banking entity's portfolio is not only a regular activity but it is one that protects the banking entity's safety and soundness. In proposing the regulation, the agencies noted the difficulties in distinguishing risk-mitigating hedging from speculative proprietary trading retrospectively.", "As with any of the otherwise proprietary trading activities that Section 619 permits, risk-mitigating hedging activities are subjected to certain prudential backstops: (1) they may not be conducted unless they are authorized under other law; (2) they may be subjected to further limitations by the agencies; (3) they must not result in \"a material conflict of interest\" between the banking entity and its customers; (4) they must not result in a \"material exposure by the banking entity \u2026 to high risk assets or high-risk trading strategies\"; and (5) they must not threaten the safety and soundness of the banking entity or U.S. financial stability.", "Deemphasizing the potential merits of the proposed rule, other observers such as Senator Richard Shelby, ranking Member of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, have suggested that it would be easier to ensure bank safety and soundness by simply ensuring that banks are subject to robust capital requirements.", "Some critics argue that the proposed rule is too permissive and will fail to prevent speculative trading. They argue that a large and complex banking organization will likely be able to justify almost any speculative trade as being \"reasonably correlated\" to other positions held by the institution. Critics argue that the definition of hedge should be narrowed and that firms should not be able to justify trades by reference to the general condition of the banking entity.", "Other critics argue that the proposed rule is too strict and will prevent legitimate hedging activities. They point out that prudential hedging must address a variety of sources of risks, not just the risks of individual assets. For example, when a bank provides a loan commitment to an industrial manufacturer, the bank is exposed to counterparty risk (the risk that the manufacturer will default), interest rate risk (the risk that interest rates will move in a disadvantageous direction during the period of the loan commitment), and a number of other risks. These critics point out that the natural diversification of large portfolios makes measuring risk more complex. According to this perspective, firms should be able to use hedging strategies that address residual risks after a portfolio is netted, which might not be easy to document to satisfy the conditions in the proposed rule.", "Criticism has been leveled by industry participants. Professor Hal Scott, for the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, sees the criteria as indicating \"a belief on the part of the Agencies that hedging should be more precise a practice than it generally is, not producing excess profit or loss.\" Morgan Stanley recommended that the agencies dispense with the \"list of specific criteria because of the possibility of interpreting it as requiring the matching of principal positions with specific hedges,\" and adopt a more process-oriented framework. PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC) took issue with the implication in the proposal that proper hedges do not result in appreciable profit. It called upon the agencies to focus not on compensation, but on the purpose for which the hedge was transacted, and reminded the agencies that \"the fact that the organization managed to effectively hedge its risks in a manner that also provides incidental profits to the organization promotes\u2014rather than jeopardizes\u2014the safety and soundness of the entity.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "JP Morgan Trading Losses in the Context of the Volcker Rule", "paragraphs": ["JP Morgan criticized both the statute and the regulation as leaving \"in doubt the protection of ... numerous legitimate asset-liability management hedging activities\" and described some that it had used during the financial crisis that might not be exempt under the rule and that might be analogous to the type of hedging involved in the recent losses.

However, the Volcker Rule has yet to be implemented, so that it is not possible to test the bank's assertion.", "Going forward, there are several unanswered questions over the potential applicability of the not-yet-implemented Volcker Rule to scenarios such as the JP Morgan trades. For example, to the layman, hedging strategies are expected to lose money. Hedges are usually payments for protection from bad events\u2014protection that the hedger hopes will not be needed. For example, if an airline signs a 10-year fuel contract at what it expects the long-run cost of fuel to be, and wishes to hedge against even higher fuel prices, then the airline might buy fuel derivatives. If fuel prices remain in the expected range, then the airline paid for protection, which it turns out it did not need, and the airline loses money on the hedge, but makes money overall. It would be very strange if people were surprised by announcements by airlines that they had lost money on fuel derivatives. The airline only expects to make money on the hedge if the price of fuel rises\u2014which is bad for the airline overall; otherwise the airline expects to lose on the hedge.", "It may be that the JP Morgan trade was indeed a hedge, but it has some elements that appear to violate the common understanding of a hedge. According to public disclosures, the JP Morgan trade was designed to profit the firm if economic conditions improved in the short run. Presumably, JP Morgan's general banking business is expected to perform better if economic conditions improve. Therefore, by itself, the described trade does not fit the common understanding of hedging as described above.", "Modern risk management and modern banking regulation are more complex than the common understanding of hedging. Financial institutions are exposed to a variety of risks from a number of sources, some of which may occasionally move in opposite directions. For example, two of the risks that a bank faces when it extends a loan commitment are (1) the risk that the borrower will default (credit risk), and (2) the risk that interest rates will move in a disadvantageous direction during the period of the loan commitment (interest rate risk). In general, interest rate risk is usually correlated with general economic conditions and partially offsets default risk. Whereas a loan commitment to a manufacturer may be more likely to default during bad economic conditions, a loan commitment to a law firm specializing in bankruptcy cases may be less likely to default during bad economic conditions. Therefore, it is possible that there would not be a single best hedging strategy to address the performance of a portfolio of loan commitments in a bad economic environment. In practice, banks are exposed to several other risks besides credit and interest rate risk, including but not limited to market risk, reputational risk, legal risk, and liquidity risks.", "The JP Morgan CIO transactions might be a real hedge under this more nuanced appreciation for modern risk management. In addition to any correlations to JP Morgan's overall portfolio, a complex transaction might be used to manage the risk of another position that is slowly unwinding\u2014which in the absence of full information might appear to \"double down\" on JP Morgan's overall portfolio. Or, a complex transaction might be used to manage residual counterparty risk or residual market risk even though the transaction does not address the firm's overall portfolio or correlate with a specific asset or liability. Without more details, competing characterizations cannot be ruled out.", "In addition to issues raised at the firm level, the JP Morgan trades raise issues of congressional oversight. The complexity of modern risk management may make it difficult for Congress to monitor enforcement of the Volcker Rule by the financial regulators.

In reports that some current JP Morgan officials dispute, some former JP Morgan officials have said that risk managers charged with overseeing the CIO's trades tended to be marginalized by Mr. Macris, the head of the CIO's London office. Generally supportive of Mr. Macris' management, Ina Drew, head of the CIO, was reported to have intervened sparingly in Mr. Macris' management of the office. In 2011, in what some say reflected aggressive risk taking, Mr. Macris reportedly unilaterally decided to abandon risk-control caps that had previously required traders to exit positions when their losses exceeded $20 million. According to some media reports, in 2010, Joseph Bonocore, then-CIO's chief financial officer, reportedly grew concerned when he learned that traders at the London desk lost about $300 million on foreign exchange options during a few days, losses that had not been offset by offsetting gains. He supposedly took his concerns to Barry Zubrow, then-JP Morgan's chief risk officer, and Michael Cavanagh, then-bank's chief financial officer, both of whom reported to the CEO. Both men are reported to have authorized Mr. Bonocore to order a reduction to the trading position. The London desk reportedly complied with Mr. Bonocore's subsequent order to reduce the position. JP Morgan's corporate treasurer reported to the bank's chief finance officer and managed the firm's balance sheet, capital, funding, and liquidity, and worked closely with heads of all its business lines. After 11 years as the CIO's CFO, Joseph Bonocore became the bank's treasurer in late 2010. His duties were reported to include weekly reviews of the CIO's trading positions. Reports say that before leaving the position of treasurer in October 2011, Mr. Bonocore expressed general concerns over the risks that the CIO's London office had been taking. After Mr. Bonocore left, the position of treasurer remained unfilled through March 2012, the period in which the CIO suffered the large reported trading losses. Reports suggest that in 2011, several executives in the CIO's New York office developed some concerns that traders at the London desk were taking large trading positions in illiquid derivative indexes. Peter Weiland, then-CIO's chief risk officer, and some of his colleagues supposedly reportedly grew concerned that, if JP Morgan opted to sell the positions, it could incur significant losses. In late 2011, during a meeting of CIO management personnel, which was reported to include Ms. Drew, Mr. Macris, and Mr. Weiland, the group was reported to agree that the positions should be liquidated over the course of time. Subsequently, however, the London desk reportedly conducted new trades that appeared to contradict the directive. During the summer of 2011, Mr. Weiland, then-CIO's chief risk officer, reportedly began an assessment of the CIO's risk limits, which included discussions on whether restrictions needed to be tighter and more specifically delineated. According to the news reports, new limits were not implemented. An article in the Wall Street Journal reported that, while he was the CIO's risk officer, Mr. Weiland told Ms. Drew that she needed to hire more personnel with credit risk skills and to allow those CIO credit risk officers who were engaged in other duties to focus on their jobs and not other tasks. Late in January 2012, Mr. Weiland was replaced as the unit's head of risk with Irvin Goldman, a former trader who the news accounts indicate had no experience as a risk manager and who was the brother-in-law of Mr. Zubrow, the bank's chief risk officer.

During her absence, news reports said that the heads of the CIO's New York and London offices argued over the level of risk that the London office was taking, particularly the risks being taken by Bruno Iskil, a key trader in the office, who was nicknamed the \"whale.\" Mr. Macris, head of the London office, was reported to ignore the cautionary concerns expressed by the head of the New York desk.

He added, however, that these generally modest changes tend not to result in \"dramatically different results.\" In this context, Mr. Finger noted that the older VaR model that the CIO reinstated reported \"a huge, huge increase in risk\" over what the earlier replacement model showed.", "On the general issue of their changing VaR models, Mr. Dimon observed that the company has \"an independent model review group that looks at changes in models, and [that in the bank] \u2026 [m]odels are constantly being changed for new facts.\" Mr. Dimon also noted that \"models are backward looking \u2026 [a]nd never are totally adequate in capturing changes in businesses, concentration, liquidity, or geopolitics or things like that. So we're constantly improving them.\"", "Later, however, among other things, the July 2012 CIO Task Force Update concluded that (1) the approval process for the problematic VaR model by JP Morgan's independent model review group was inadequate because of its reliance on parallel testing by the CIO and its use of unsuitable and overly optimistic assumptions; and (2) the implementation of the CIO's model's implementation by the CIO was undermined by operational challenges.", "As part of its investigation of JP Morgan, the OCC may be interested in examining the corporate protocol used to authorize the changes to the CIO's VaR models. SEC Chair Mary Schapiro has emphasized that \"when there are changes to the VaR model \u2026 those changes have to be disclosed.\" As part of its probe of JP Morgan, the agency is likely to examine the accuracy and the timeliness of the bank's disclosures on changes to its VaR models for the CIO."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "JP Morgan's Risk Management Committee", "paragraphs": ["Many financial firms have a risk management committee that is composed of members of the board. JP Morgan has such a risk committee. It is charged with approving its risk policies and overseeing its chief risk officer. According to company documents, the committee met seven times in 2011 and had the same three members between 2008 and the second quarter of 2012.", "As of May 2012, the three directors on JP Morgan's risk management committee were James Crown, president of Chicago-based Henry Crown and the lead board director of the General Dynamics Corporation; Ellen Futter, a former corporate lawyer and former chair of the New York Federal Reserve Bank from 1992 to 1993, who is currently president of the American Museum of Natural History; and David Cote, CEO of Honeywell International. An article in Bloomberg reported that, unlike the risk committee of a number of other large domestic banks, no members of the committee reportedly worked at a bank or had been employed as financial risk managers. It also reported that the only committee member with experience on Wall Street, James Crown, the committee chair, reportedly has not worked in the industry in more than 20 years.", "Comparing the composition of the bank's risk management committee to its mandate, Anat Admati, a professor of finance at Stanford University who specializes in corporate governance, commented, \"It seems hard to believe that this is good enough. It's a massive task to watch the risk of JP Morgan.\"", "According to a report from CNBC , in 2011, the CtW Investment Group, a union-based shareholder group, sent a letter to JP Morgan officials expressing concerns about the risk management committee. CNBC reported that the group complained that the panel had no one with expertise in \"banking or financial regulation\" and that it was \"not up to the task of overseeing risk management at one of the world's largest and most complex financial institutions.\" ", "At least one analyst, Barbara Matthews, a financial regulatory expert at BCM Regulatory Analytics in Washington, DC, asked whether the committee may have been out of JP Morgan's risk management \"loop.\" She also observed, \"If we find out that this is yet another example like AIG where information was not trickling up to the risk committee, that is one kind of risk management problem that frankly should have been addressed a long time ago.\"", "Mr. Dimon has defended the risk management committee, saying that it \"did a great job,\" noting that it had successfully seen the company through the earlier financial panic. Mr. Dimon stated that the bank's board was replacing two committee members, and he also emphasized that it was unfair to blame the risk committee for the trade losses because it had depended on management to communicate key risk-based information to it, a responsibility that he said management failed to fulfill.", "The Dodd-Frank Act requires that each publicly traded bank holding company with $10 billion or more in assets establish a risk management committee entirely composed of independent directors. The committee is also required to have at least one member who is a risk management expert. As of July 2012, the Federal Reserve had not completed its rulemaking in this area."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
