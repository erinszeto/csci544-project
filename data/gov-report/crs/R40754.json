Several authorization and appropriations measures enacted during the 111th Congress addressed the disposition and treatment of Guantanamo detainees. This report analyzes legislation enacted in the 111th Congress concerning persons held at the Guantanamo detention facility.", "Nine laws that were enacted during the 111th Congress contained provisions directly relating to Guantanamo detainees: the 2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act (P.L. 111-32); the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-83); the 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 111-84); the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-88); the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-117); the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-118); the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-212); the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 (P.L. 111-259); and the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for FY2011 (2011 NDAA, P.L. 111-383). Many of these measures imposed conditions on the use of appropriated funds to transfer or release Guantanamo detainees into the United States. The fourth Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (P.L. 111-322), has effectively extended the restrictions imposed by FY2010 appropriations enactments through March 4, 2011.", "Several appropriations measures enacted in the 111th Congress restricted appropriated funds from being used to transfer or release Guantanamo detainees into the United States; they permitted transfers for purposes of criminal prosecution or detention during legal proceedings, contingent upon certain reporting requirements being fulfilled. However, the 2011 NDAA (P.L. 111-383), which was signed into law on January 7, 2011, prohibits any funds it authorizes to be appropriated to the Department of Defense (DOD) from being used to transfer Guantanamo detainees into the United States for any purpose, and also bars such funds from being used to assist in the transfer of such persons. Because Guantanamo detainees are presently in military custody, the act could be interpreted as effectively barring the transfer of any Guantanamo detainee into the United States, despite language in authorizing appropriations measures for other federal agencies that permits the use of funds to transfer detainees into the country for criminal prosecution. In addition to these restrictions, the 2011 NDAA bars authorized funds from being used to construct facilities in the United States to house transferred Guantanamo detainees, and also imposes restrictions on the transfer of detainees to certain foreign countries in order to deter the return of transferred detainees to hostilities. Upon signing the act into law, President Obama issued a statement describing his opposition to the legislation's restrictions on the transfer of Guantanamo detainees, and claimed that his Administration will work with Congress to seek to repeal or mitigate the effect of these restrictions. He did not allege that these provisions are an unconstitutional infringement on executive discretion, or state that the provisions would not be enforced.", "Legislation enacted in the 111th Congress also addressed issues related to the treatment and disposition of Guantanamo detainees. For example, Title XVIII of the FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act establishes new procedures for military commissions.

Many of the restrictions applied only to funds appropriated during the 2010 fiscal year.

Additionally, the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for FY2011 (2011 NDAA, P.L. 111-383 ), which was signed into law on January 7, 2011, contains blanket restrictions on the use of military funds either to transfer or release Guantanamo detainees into the United States, or assist in the transfer or release of such persons into the country.

Pursuant to that authority, the United States has captured suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban members and detained them at several locations, including Guantanamo. Most of the 779 persons detained at Guantanamo at some point during post-9/11 military operations have been transferred to a foreign government for continued detention or release. As of January 11, 2010, 173 detainees continue to be held at the facility. A number of issues concerning the remaining detainees are unsettled. In some instances, the United States has encountered difficulties repatriating or resettling Guantanamo detainees who are no longer believed to be enemy belligerents, either because it has been unable to find a country willing to accept them, or because of concerns that a detainee would face torture if transferred to a particular country. Other issues have arisen concerning whether to try certain detainees for criminal offenses in either military or civilian courts, or whether some detainees may lawfully be held for the duration of the conflict with Al Qaeda and the Taliban so as to prevent their return to hostilities.", "Since its inception, the policy of detaining suspected belligerents at Guantanamo has been the subject of controversy. Shortly after taking office, President Barack Obama issued three executive orders affecting U.S. policy towards Guantanamo detainees. Most notably, Executive Order 13492 called for the Guantanamo detention facility to be closed as soon as practicable, and no later than January 22, 2010. It also ordered an immediate review of each detainee's status by a special task force and temporarily halted all proceedings before military commissions. Although the order's deadline for the closure of the Guantanamo detention facility was not met, the Obama Administration has stated that it remains committed to closing the facility as expeditiously as possible. Military commission proceedings for some Guantanamo detainees charged with war crimes have also resumed.", "Two additional executive orders addressed overall wartime detention policy. One limited the methods for interrogating persons in U.S. custody (as part of any armed conflict) to those listed in the Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations, although it provides an exception for interrogations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), stating that the FBI may \"continu[e] to use authorized, non-coercive techniques of interrogation that are designed to elicit voluntary statements and do not involve the use of force, threats, or promises.\" Another executive order established the Special Task Force on Detainee Disposition, tasked with \"identif[ying] lawful options\" for the disposition of Guantanamo detainees and others captured by the United States. Because executive orders can be revoked or modified by subsequent presidential directives, legislation would be necessary to make the President's policies permanent. Likewise, Congress may reverse or adjust the approach of the executive orders by statute in any area in which it has the authority to act.", "Key issues implicated by the potential closure of the Guantanamo detention facility include the transfer or release of detainees and procedures for prosecuting them or assessing their enemy belligerency status. Some members of Congress have noted that issues related to the disposition of the remaining detainees complicate any legislative actions to fund, mandate, or prohibit closure of the detention facility. For example, when introducing a bill proposing a timeline for closure of the facility, Senator Dianne Feinstein noted that \"the hard part about closing Guantanamo is not deciding to go do it; it is figuring out what to do with the remaining detainees.\" Thus, much of the legislative activity related to Guantanamo has focused on the transfer, release, and treatment of detainees.", "Proposed transfers to the United States have garnered particular attention. In November 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that five Guantanamo detainees would be transferred to New York for prosecution for criminal offenses related to the 9/11 terrorist attacks (one Guantanamo detainee had already been transferred to the United States in June 2009 to face criminal charges related to the bombing of the U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya ). In December 2009, the President issued a memorandum directing the acquisition of the Thomson Correctional Center, a maximum-security facility in Illinois, so that designated Guantanamo detainees could be transferred there for continued detention. The implementation of these proposals was reportedly placed on hold, with alternative approaches being developed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Enacted Laws", "paragraphs": ["Provisions relating to Guantanamo detainees were enacted as part of nine laws in the 111 th Congress.

The majority of these enactments contain restrictions on the use of appropriated funds to transfer or release Guantanamo detainees into the United States; the most stringent restriction being found in the 2011 NDAA, which includes a blanket prohibition on the use of authorized funds to transfer or release Guantanamo detainees into the country for any purpose. Two other measures enacted in the 111 th Congress, the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010 ( P.L. 111-212 ), and the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 ( P.L. 111-259 ), do not contain provisions directly affecting Guantanamo detainees, but do require the Executive to supply certain information to Congress or the public that pertains to such persons.", "Congress did not enact any FY2011 regular appropriations acts by the end of the 2010 fiscal year, Instead, Congress passed a series of continuing resolutions to temporarily extend funding for federal agencies. On December 22, 2010, President Obama signed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 ( P.L. 111-322 ) into law. The act generally extends funding for federal agencies at the FY2010 enacted spending levels through March 4, 2011, under the authority and conditions provided for under FY2010 appropriations acts.

The prohibition on the use of funds to assist in the transfer or release of detainees appears to prevent the DOD from participating in any effort by another entity to transfer or release detainees into the United States.", "Because Guantanamo detainees are presently in military custody, the 2011 NDAA appears to effectively bar the transfer of any Guantanamo detainee into the country, despite language in previously enacted measures that permitted other federal agencies to use appropriated funds to transfer detainees into the country for criminal prosecution. Some have suggested that because the defense authorization act only restricts the use of military funding to transfer Guantanamo detainees, it would not prevent another federal agency (e.g., the Department of Justice) from using its own appropriated funds to effectuate the transfer of Guantanamo detainees into the United States, subject to the limitations contained in relevant appropriations enactments. On the other hand, examination of the legislative record supports the view that Congress believed that the defense authorization act would effectively prevent the transfer of any Guantanamo detainee into the United States. When presenting the bill for consideration on the House floor, House Chairman of the Armed Services Committee Ike Skelton characterized the measure as:", "the most thorough and comprehensive set of restrictions ever placed on the transfer and release of detainees. It is substantially stronger than current law, and voting against this bill will have the effect of making it easier to bring detainees into the United States\u2026.", "Statements made by other members of the House and Senate during consideration of the act also appear to reflect a belief that the measure would effectively preclude any transfer of Guantanamo detainees into the United States.", "When signing the 2011 NDAA into law, President Obama issued a statement expressing his opposition to those provisions that limit executive discretion to transfer detainees into the United States or to the custody of certain foreign governments or entities. In the statement, President Obama expressed concern that the provision limiting detainee transfers into the United States \"represents a dangerous and unprecedented challenge to critical executive branch authority to determine when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees\u2026.\" He further stated that the provision limiting executive discretion to transfer detainees to the custody of foreign entities would \"interfere with the authority of the executive branch to make important and consequential foreign policy and national security determinations\" regarding the transfer of persons captured in an armed conflict. While highly critical of these provisions' effect on executive discretion, President Obama's signing statement did not allege that they represented an unconstitutional infringement upon executive authority, or claim that the executive branch was not legally bound to comply with the provisions' requirements.

It appears to contemplate a somewhat greater degree of involvement by state governors in detainee transfer decisions than the 2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act, which only required a certification that a governor had been \"notified\" regarding a transfer.", "In all of the other measures containing reporting requirements with respect to the transfer of detainees into the United States, the components of the 45-day reports are identical and include some information required by the 2009 Supplemental and the FY2010 Defense Authorization Acts.

One instance where the DOJ might opt to read Miranda warnings to an enemy belligerent in military custody would be when it intends to bring criminal charges against a detainee in federal civilian court.", "Finally, section 1080 of the 2010 National Defense Authorization Act requires, among other things, that the Department of Defense \"ensure that each strategic intelligence interrogation of any person who is in the custody or under the effective control of the Department of Defense or under detention in a Department of Defense facility is videotaped or otherwise electronically recorded.\"", "The FY2010 Homeland Security Appropriations Act includes two additional provisions affecting the treatment of Guantanamo detainees.

This prohibition is similar to other proposals introduced during the 111 th Congress; however, the other proposals would apply permanently, whereas the prohibition in the Homeland Security Appropriations Act appears to apply only to funds appropriated by that act.

Some bills would have restricted the Department of Justice's use of federal funds to conduct prosecutions of Guantanamo detainees or others with possible ties to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. For example, S. 2795 and H.R. 4542 would have prohibited the use of such funds by the Department of Justice to prosecute Guantanamo detainees in criminal courts in the United States or its territories or possessions. Although the bills did not define the term \"criminal court,\" it is likely that it would have extended to prosecutions in both Article III courts and in any military commissions that may be established in the United States. This funding restriction would not appear to have precluded the Department of Defense from prosecuting detainees before military tribunals. Companion bills, S. 2977 and H.R. 4556 , might have applied to individuals other than Guantanamo detainees. They would have prohibited the Department of Justice's use of federal funds to commence or continue the prosecution in an Article III court of any individual who: is suspected of \"planning, authorizing, organizing, committing, or aiding the attacks on the United States and its citizens that occurred on September 11, 2001\"; is not a citizen of the United States; and is subject to proceedings before a military commission. An alternative proposal, H.R. 4588 , would have affirmatively required that Guantanamo detainees be tried only in military commissions.", "Several proposals would have reaffirmed or extended executive authority to detain persons associated with U.S. operations against Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and other entities. S. 3707 , the Terrorist Detention Review Reform Act, would have \"reaffirm[ed]\" the President's authority \"to detain unprivileged enemy belligerents in connection with the continuing armed conflict with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces, regardless of the place of capture, until the termination of hostilities.\" The bill would have also established jurisdiction, venue, and procedures for habeas corpus challenges raised by persons detained as \"unprivileged enemy belligerents\" at Guantanamo or other locations who are subject to the habeas jurisdiction of the federal courts. Similar authorities would have been provided by Enemy Combatant Detention Review Act of 2009 ( H.R. 630 ). Another bill, the Protecting America's Communities Act ( S. 1071 ), contained a similar provision concerning the President's authority to detain persons in the conflict with Al Qaeda and the Taliban. These provisions would have perhaps broadened the President's authority to preventively detain enemy belligerents as part of post-9/11 military operations. In Hamdi v. Rumsfeld , the Supreme Court held that the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force authorized the President to preventively detain enemy combatants captured during hostilities in Afghanistan but did not address whether such authority extends to captures made in other locations. The aforementioned bills appear to have expressly authorized the detention of persons captured away from the Afghan zone of combat.", "The Terrorist Detainees Procedures Act of 2009, H.R. 1315 , would likewise have granted exclusive jurisdiction over habeas challenges to the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia and stay pending habeas cases. However, in contrast to H.R. 630 , it would have stayed habeas proceedings not to facilitate trials before military commissions but to await the outcome of status review hearings held by panels of military judges. In addition, the time period in which judges would render decisions in the status review process would have been sharply limited\u2014to 120 days from the legislation's enactment for all detainees, unless a military judge extended that date for good cause.", "Finally, several House resolutions would have possibly facilitated greater congressional oversight. Namely, H.Res. 920 , H.Res. 922 , and H.Res. 923 required or requested the transmittal to the House of Representatives of relevant documents or information in the possession of the Attorney General, Secretary of Homeland Security, and the President, respectively, relating to Guantanamo detainees. In each case, the request or direction included a 14-day timeline for transmittal."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Soon after taking office, President Obama issued an executive order to effectuate the closure of the Guantanamo detention facility within a year. The announced deadline for closing the facility has not been met, arguably in part because of a series of congressional enactments limiting executive discretion to transfer or release detainees into the United States. Congress has passed numerous measures which suggest strong opposition to the possibility that a detainee might be released into the United States, even if he is found not to have been an enemy belligerent. Until recently, Congress had been less resistant to the possibility of transferring detainees into the United States for criminal prosecution, provided that the Executive first provides Congress with a risk assessment and other information relating to the proposed transfer. However, at the end of the 111 th Congress, legislative activity involved measures to bar the transfer of detainees to the United States for any purpose, including criminal prosecution. These restrictions were ultimately enacted into law pursuant to the 2011 NDAA. By prohibiting military funds from being used to transfer or release detainees into the United States, or assist in the transfer or release of detainees into the country, the act seems to ensure that the Guantanamo detention facility remains open and at least through the 2011 fiscal year, and perhaps for the foreseeable future. Moreover, the measure appears to make military tribunals the only viable forum by which Guantanamo detainees could be tried for criminal offenses, as no civilian court operates within Guantanamo.", "Other changes effected by legislation enacted in the 111 th Congress, such as the establishment of new military commission procedures, may also significantly impact the treatment and disposition of Guantanamo detainees. These and other proposals in the 111 th Congress are likely to inform future legislative debates regarding the treatment and rights of detainees at Guantanamo and elsewhere."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
