After this initial sweep, however, the freezing of terrorist assets sloweddown considerably.

Of the $1.6 billion in state sponsors of terrorism's assets locatedin the United States, $1.5 billion have been frozen by U.S. economic sanctions. Of that $1.5 billion,the assets of Libya, which were blocked on September, 20, 2004, made up all but $425 million.

The federal government stepped up its efforts to targetmoney laundering in 1970 with the passage of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and subsequentamendments. In the years following the enactment of the BSA, Congress added criminal and civilsanctions for money launderers. The threat posed by terrorists, however, forced Congress in 2001to bring terrorist financing -- which often is accomplished with legally-derived funds -- within therange of activities punishable under the federal money laundering laws. What follows is an overviewof these laws.", "The Bank Secrecy Act. Congress laid thefoundations of the federal anti-money laundering (AML) framework in 1970 when it passed theBSA, (8) the major moneylaundering provisions of which make up the Currency and Foreign Transaction Reporting Act(CFTRA). The BSA framework focuses on financial institutions' record- keeping, so that federalagencies are able to apprehend criminals by tracing their money trails. (9) Under this statute andsubsequent amendments to it, primary responsibility rests with the financial institutions themselvesin gathering information and passing it on to federal officials. CFTRA also contains civil (10) and criminal (11) penalties forviolations ofits reporting requirements.", "Under CFTRA, financial institutions must file reports for cash transactions exceeding theamount set by the Secretary of the Treasury in regulations. (12) The Secretary has set theamount for filing these currency transaction reports (CTRs) at $10,000. (13) The Secretary alsorequires financial institutions to file suspicious activity reports (SARs) for transactions of at least$5,000 in which the bank suspects or has reason to suspect the transaction involves illegally-obtainedfunds or is intended to evade reporting requirements. (14) ", "CFTRA contains significant requirements related to foreign-based monetary transactions. Citizens are required to keep records and file reports regarding transactions with foreign financialagencies, and the Treasury Secretary must promulgate regulations in this area. (15) The statute also requiresthe filing of reports by anyone who exports from the United States or imports into the United Statesa monetary instrument of more than $10,000. (16) ", "The Internal Revenue Service has certain authorities and responsibilities under the BSA (seep. 21).", "The International Emergency Economic PowersAct. Under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (17) (IEEPA), enacted in 1977,the President has broad powers pursuant to a declaration of a national emergency with respect to athreat \"which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the nationalsecurity, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.\" (18) These powers include theability to seize foreign assets under U.S. jurisdiction, to prohibit any transactions in foreignexchange, to prohibit payments between financial institutions involving foreign currency, and toprohibit the import/export of foreign currency. (19) ", "The Money Laundering Control Act. Congresscriminalized money laundering in 1986 with the passage of the Money Laundering Control Act. (20) Defining moneylaundering as conducting financial transactions with property known to be derived from unlawfulactivity in order to further or conceal such activity, the act made three specific types of moneylaundering illegal: 1) domestic money laundering; 2) international money laundering; and 3)attempted money laundering uncovered as part of an undercover sting operation. (21) If the transaction is foran amount in excess of $10,000, the government does not have to show that the defendant knew thetransaction in question was meant to further or conceal an illegal act, only that the defendant knewthe property was procured via illegal activity. (22) ", "The Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money LaunderingAct. With the passage of the Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act (23) in 1992, Congressincreased the penalties for depository institutions that violate the federal anti-money laundering laws. In addition to authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to require filings of the aforementionedSARs, the act made it possible for banking regulators to place into conservatorship banks and creditunions that violate these laws. (24) In addition, the act gave the Office of the Comptroller of theCurrency (OCC) the power to revoke the charters of national banks found to be guilty of moneylaundering or cash reporting offenses, (25) and gave the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) theauthority to terminate federal insurance for guilty state banks and savings associations. (26) The Annunzio-Wylie Actalso introduced federal penalties for operating money transmitting businesses (27) operating without licensesunder state law. (28) ", "The Money Laundering Suppression Act. In theearly 1990s it became apparent that the number of currency transaction reports being filed greatlysurpassed the ability of regulators to analyze them. So, in 1994, Congress passed legislation (29) mandating certainexemptions from reporting requirements in an effort to reduce the number of CTR filings by30%. (30) In addition,the act directed the Treasury Secretary to designate a single agency to receive suspicious activityreport filings. (31) Underthis statute, money transmitting businesses are required to register with the Treasury Secretary. Inaddition, the act clarified the BSA's applicability to state-chartered and tribal gamingestablishments. (32) ", "The Money Laundering and Financial Crimes StrategyAct. Congress in 1998 directed the Treasury Secretary to develop a nationalstrategy for combating money laundering. (33) As part of this strategy, the Treasury Secretary -- in consultationwith the U.S. Attorney General -- must attempt to prioritize money laundering enforcement effortsby identifying areas of the U.S. as \"high-risk money laundering and related financial crimes areas\"(HIFCAs). (34) Inaddition, the Treasury Secretary may issue grants to state and local law enforcement agencies forfighting money laundering in HIFCAs. (35) ", "Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act. In the wakeof the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act. (36) Congress devoted TitleIII of this act to combating terrorist financing. (37) Given that funds used to finance terrorist activities are often notderived from illegal activities, prosecution for funding terrorist activities under the pre-USAPATRIOT Act money laundering laws was difficult. Title III, however, made providing materialsupport to a foreign terrorist organization a predicate offense for money laundering prosecutionunder section 1956 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code. (38) ", "Under Title III, the Treasury Secretary may require domestic financial institutions toundertake certain \"special measures\" if the Secretary concludes that specific regions, financialinstitutions, or transactions outside of the United States are of primary money launderingconcern. (39) In additionto retaining more specific records on financial institutions, these special measures include obtaininginformation on beneficial ownership of accounts and information relating to certainpayable-through (40) andcorrespondent accounts. (41) The Treasury Secretary is also empowered to prohibit or restrictthe opening of these payable-through and correspondent accounts, (42) and U.S. financialinstitutions are required to establish internal procedures to detect money laundered through theseaccounts. (43) In addition,financial institutions and broker-dealers are prohibited from maintaining correspondent accounts forforeign \"shell banks,\" i.e., banks that have no physical presence in their supposed homecountries. (44) Institutionsare subject to fines of up to $1 million for violations of these provisions. (45) ", "Title III allows for judicial review of assets seized due to suspicion of terrorist-relatedactivities and the applicability of the \"innocent owner\" defense, (46) although the governmentis permitted in such cases to submit evidence that would not otherwise be admissible under theFederal Rules of Evidence, if following those rules would jeopardize national security. (47) Title III also allows forjurisdiction over foreign persons and financial institutions for prosecutions under sections 1956 and1957 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code. (48) ", "The USA PATRIOT Act permits forfeiture of property traceable to proceeds from variousoffenses against foreign nations. (49) The act also permits forfeiture of accounts held in a foreign bankif that bank has an interbank account in a U.S. financial institution; in essence, law enforcementofficials are authorized to substitute funds in the interbank account for those in the targeted foreignaccount. (50) Forfeitureis also authorized for currency reporting violations and violations of BSA prohibitions againstevasive structuring of transactions. (51) ", "Title III requires each financial institution to establish an anti-money laundering program,which at a minimum must include the development of internal procedures, the designation of acompliance officer, an employee training program, and an independent audit program to test theinstitution's anti-money laundering program. (52) In order to allow for meaningful inspection of financialinstitutions' AML efforts, Title III requires financial institutions to provide information on their AMLcompliance within 120 hours of a request for such information by the Treasury Secretary. (53) Also, financial institutionsapplying to merge under the Bank Holding Act or the Federal Deposit Insurance Act mustdemonstrate some effectiveness in combating money laundering. (54) Financial institutions areallowed to include suspicions of illegal activity in written employment references regarding currentor former employees. (55) ", "Title III extends the Suspicious Activity Reports filing requirement to broker-dealers, (56) and gives the TreasurySecretary the authority to pass along SARs to U.S. intelligence agencies in order to combatinternational terrorism. (57) Anyone engaged in a trade or business who receives $10,000cash in one transaction must file a report with the Treasury Department's Financial CrimesEnforcement Network (FinCEN) identifying the customer and specifying the amount and date of thetransaction. (58) Inaddition, the USA PATRIOT Act makes it a crime to knowingly conceal more than $10,000 in cashor other monetary instruments and attempt to transport it into or outside of the United States. Thisoffense carries with it imprisonment of up to five years, forfeiture of any property involved, andseizure of any property traceable to the violation. (59) ", "Significantly, the USA PATRIOT Act requires financial institutions to establish proceduresso that these institutions can verify the identities and addresses of customers seeking to openaccounts, and check this information against government-provided lists of known terrorists. (60) Title III also allows theTreasury Secretary to promulgate regulations that prohibit the use of concentration accounts todisguise the owners of and fund movements in bank accounts. (61) ", "Under Title III, FinCEN has statutorily-based authority to conduct its duties within theTreasury Department. (62) Significantly, the act requires FinCEN to maintain a highly secure network so that financialinstitutions can file their BSA reports electronically. (63) ", "The Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism ConventionImplementation Act. In order to implement the International Convention for theSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism, Congress in 2002 made it a crime to collect or providefunds to support terrorist activities (or to conceal such fund-raising efforts), regardless of whetherthe offense was committed in the United States or the accused was a United States citizen. (64) ", "The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of2004. Section 362 of the USA PATRIOT Act required the Secretary of theTreasury to establish within FinCEN a \"highly secure network\" to process BSA reports and toprovide information to financial institutions regarding patterns of suspicious activity gleaned fromthese reports. With the passage of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004(IRTPA), Congress authorized the appropriation of $16.5 million for the development of FinCEN's\"BSA Direct\" program, which is designed to improve the aforementioned network by making iteasier for law enforcement to access BSA filings and improving overall data management. (65) The act also authorizesan additional $19 million for improvements related to -- among other things -- telecommunicationsand analytical technologies, (66) and makes permanent the amendments to the BSA contained inTitle III of the USA PATRIOT Act. (67) ", "The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 requires the TreasurySecretary to issue regulations mandating the reporting of cross-border transmittals by certainfinancial institutions, (68) and to submit a report to Congress on the Treasury Department's efforts to combat money launderingand terrorist financing. (69) In addition, under IRTPA, a federal financial institutionexaminer who leaves the federal government is required to wait one year before accepting a job withan institution that the examiner was responsible for examining.

Among them is the Foreign TerroristAsset Targeting Group (FTATG), the Executive Branch's principal inter-agency analytic group,which is charged with assessing intelligence on terrorist financing, and providing the NationalSecurity Council's (NSC) Terrorist Finance Policy Coordinating Committee (PCC) \"intelligenceassessments\" of individuals and groups suspected of financially supporting terrorists.", "FTATG engages in joint discussions with member agencies of the Targeting Action Groupunder the Terrorist Financing PCC, developing suggested actions -- ranging from the freezing ofassets to diplomatic options -- that policymakers can consider taking against suspected terroristfinanciers. ", "Although FTATG's first two directors were Immigration and Custom Enforcement detailees,the NSC in November 2004 restructured FTATG and named a Federal Bureau of Investigationspecial agent as director and an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) special agent as deputydirector. Until then, both positions had been vacant for eight months, a period during which FTATGfoundered, according to some observers. As part of the restructuring, the NSC narrowed FTATG'sfocus to providing intelligence assessments of terrorist financing targets designated by the NSC'sTerrorist Financing PCC. Prior to the restructuring, FTATG in some instances would identifytargets, but now serves strictly as the NSC's research arm. In January 2005, FTATG's memberagencies (72) eachcommitted to providing staff to serve at FTATG. The Group currently has slightly over half its staffcomplement in place. ", "In May 2000 President Bill Clinton announced the establishment of the Foreign TerroristAsset Tracking Center (FTATC), FTATG's predecessor, (73) as part of a $300 million counterterrorism initiative, $100 millionof which was to be used to establish FTATC and target terrorist financing. (74) Congress authorizedfunding in October 2000. (75) ", "The Clinton initiative followed the prevention the previous year of a planned series of OsamaBin Laden terrorist attacks to mark the Millennium. Although the Intelligence Community (IC)successfully disrupted those attacks before they could occur, Administration officials remainedtroubled by the IC's continuing inability to identify, track and disrupt al Qaeda's financial supportnetwork. (76) ", "Vowing to gain a better understanding of the terrorists' financial network -- particularly itsfund-raising component -- White House officials conceived of and pushed for the establishment ofFTATC as a way to improve the government's understanding of how terrorists fund theiroperations. (77) Officialsenvisioned FTATC as an inter-agency all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center, andsuccessfully pushed to have it located at the Department of the Treasury. (78) But, at the time, some ofthe key agencies expected to participate and contribute resources, including the Treasury Departmentitself, did not attach a priority to collecting and analyzing terrorist financing intelligence. Indeed,Treasury officials made no mention of terrorist financing in their national security money launderingstrategy. (79) The CIA,in turn, saw little utility in tracking terrorist financing. (80) Despite this skepticism, President Bush's National SecurityAdviser Condoleezza Rice determined by spring of 2001 that terrorist financing proposals wereworth pursuing. By this time, a year had passed since the Clinton White House initially establishedterrorist finance analysis as a priority, and, yet, the Treasury Department still had not stood up acenter. Instead, Treasury officials continued their planning, intending at some future point toestablish a 24-analyst strong office. (81) ", "On the eve of the September 11, 2001 attacks, Treasury still had taken no concrete steps toestablish a center. By then, sixteen months had passed since the Clinton Administration announcedits intention to establish the Center. More than seven months had elapsed since the incoming BushAdministration had adopted the concept. And despite numerous post-9/11 declarations to thecontrary (82) -- FTATC,prior to 9/11, remained a plan rather than a reality. Even before the 9/11 attacks, signs of frustrationwere becoming evident. Treasury officials had begun blaming CIA for adopting a posture of \"benignneglect\" toward FTATC. (83) ", "Three days after the terrorist attacks of September 11, Treasury officials finally took action,establishing the Center (84) and placing it under the control of the Department's Office ofForeign Asset Control. At the time, a Treasury spokeswoman denied that there had been any unusualdelay in launching the Center, citing the logistical difficulties involved in bringing togetherrepresentatives of a number of investigative agencies. Senator Charles E. Grassley, however,expressed concern as to whether the delay \"is indicative of larger problems.\" (85) ", "Initially, the Center was comprised of the same member agencies as Operation Green Quest,a multi-agency, financial enforcement initiative set up to identify, disrupt, dismantle and ultimately\"bankrupt\" terrorist networks and their sources of funding. (86) FTATC's mission was toprovide intelligence assessments of individual and group terrorist financing targets identified byGreen Quest, which was responsible for conducting investigative operations. (87) ", "In September 2001, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), in a reportaccompanying its approved fiscal year (FY) 2002 intelligence authorization bill, endorsed IC effortsto exploit financial intelligence, and noted that the Treasury Department's FTATC concept showedpromise in providing terrorist financial analysis. But the Committee cautioned that FTATC, \"...tothe extent it will function as an element of the Intelligence Community, has not been coordinatedadequately with the Director of Central Intelligence nor reviewed by this Committee.\" (88) The Committee directedthe DCI and the Treasury Secretary to jointly prepare a report \"assessing the feasibility andadvisability of establishing an element of the federal government to provide for effective andefficient analysis and dissemination of foreign intelligence related to the financial capabilities andresources of international terrorist organizations.\" The Committee instructed that the report containan evaluation of FTATC's suitability for the task and, if appropriate, a plan for FTATC'sdevelopment. (89) ", "By May 2002, the Executive Branch had yet to complete the requested report, despite asubsequent statutory requirement contained in the USA PATRIOT Act requiring that it do so. TheSSCI noted its dissatisfaction and included a provision in the FY2003 intelligence authorization,subsequently approved by the House, establishing the FTATC at CIA, and placing it under DCIcontrol. (90) ", "Despite the statutory requirement that the FTATC be under the DCI's control, the ExecutiveBranch placed FTATC under the supervision of the NSC's Office of Combating Terrorism. As notedearlier, the Executive Branch also renamed FTATC.

(92) Since the introduction ofthe PCC, it has been argued that a new position on the NSC staff should be established -- a specialassistant to the President for combating terrorist financing. The individual, who would not havedepartmental responsibilities, would chair meetings of the PCC on terrorist financing and would beassisted by a team of directors on the NSC staff in coordinating and directing all Federal efforts onthe issue. This team would \"focus its attention on evaluating the all-source intelligence available onterrorist organizations, conducting link analysis on the organizations with information and technicalintelligence available from other departments and agencies, and developing tactics and strategies todisrupt and dismantle terrorist financial networks.\" (93) ", "There are, however, arguments that can be made against establishing new positions on theNSC staff. Size of the White House staff and expanding the span of control of the National SecurityAdviser are one set of issues. Another question is the desirability of having tactics and strategiesdeveloped by the NSC staff rather than operating departments. For instance, the Tower Boardestablished in the wake of the Iran-Contra affair in the Reagan Administration, recommended that\"As a general matter, the NSC Staff should not engage in the implementation of policy or theconduct of operations. This compromises their oversight role and usurps the responsibilities of thedepartments and agencies.\" (94) Arguably, the best approach would have the PCC developstrategies against terrorist financing, resolve inter-departmental disagreements on tactics, and bringdifferences to the attention of the NSC for resolution. It may be, however, that the perspectives ofagencies and departments are so different that there need to be arrangements more permanent thanregular PCC meetings to maintain requisite coordination. Others would argue that while a separatestaff within the larger NSC staff may not be necessary, it would be better to have the PCC headedby the National Security Adviser or her/his designee rather than an official with other importantresponsibilities and loyalties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Regulators and Institutions(95)", "paragraphs": ["The nation's financial institutions, their regulators, and certain offices within the U.S.Department of the Treasury share primary responsibility for providing information on financialtransactions that could be helpful in detecting, disrupting, and preventing the use of the nation'sfinancial system by terrorists and terrorist organizations.

FinCEN then reports what it finds back to the financial community as a whole to aidfurther detection of suspicious activities.

Therest came from casinos and securities and futures institutions. (99) SARs from depositoryinstitutions are responsible for most of the reporting accuracy problems. Nevertheless, such reportsare a part of FinCEN's outreach and education efforts on behalf of financial regulators and lawenforcement agencies.

Not generally made public, informal actions result when examinersidentify problems that are of limited scope and size, and when they consider managements ascommitted to and capable of correcting the problems. Informal actions include commitment letterssigned by institution management, or memoranda of understanding, and matters requiring boardattention in the examination reports. Formal enforcement actions are made public because they aremore severe. Such actions include cease and desist orders and formal agreements requiring theinstitution to take certain actions to correct deficiencies. Formal actions may also be taken againstofficers, directors and other individuals, including removal and prohibition from participation in thebanking industry, and civil fines. From 1998 through 2003, the OCC issued a total of 78 formalenforcement actions based, at least in part, on BSA problems. The number of informal enforcementactions has been characterized as \"countless.\" (107) The most recent case of severe BSA problems involved RiggsBank. In this case, according to the OCC, deficiencies had been noted for many years before a $25million penalty was imposed in May 2004. Riggs has ended operations and has been sold to PNCFinancial Services Group.", "The Federal Reserve System (Fed) supervises about 950 state-chartered commercial banksthat are members of the system and more than 5,000 bank and financial holding companies. Alongwith the OCC, it also supervises some international activities of national banks. The Fed uses bothon-site examination and off-site surveillance and monitoring in its supervision process. Eachinstitution is to be examined on-site every 12 to 18 months. Regulators' in-house examiners are toexamine larger institutions continuously. The Board of Governors of the Fed coordinates theexamination and compliance activities of the 12 regional banks.

In recent decades, CI has becomeincreasingly involved in investigations of possible violations of anti-money laundering and financialreporting statutes. CI uses BSA and money-laundering statutes to investigate and prosecute criminalconduct related to the tax code, such as abusive tax shelters, offshore tax evasion, and corporatefraud. CI also investigates failures to file Form 8300 (Report of Cash Payments Over $10,000Received in a Trade or Business) and criminal violations of the BSA, including the structuring ofdeposits to avoid the reporting requirements for currency transactions. As a result, the division hasbecome adept at exposing the attempts of individuals and organizations (including charities) to evadetaxes on legal income or to launder money obtained through illicit activities with the use ofnominees, cash, multiple bank accounts, layered financial transactions involving multiple entities,and the movement of funds offshore. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,CI has been adapting this capability to the special requirements of exposing, tracking, anddismantling the sources of terrorist financing. This is no easy task, partly because terrorist groupsand their financiers are constantly adjusting to efforts by major countries like the United States tostop the flow of funds to these groups. These groups are beginning to rely on methods of movingfunds outside formal financial systems such as the use of cash couriers and alternative remittancesystems. In FY2005, CI's spending on investigating terrorist financing is likely to amount to $30.5million, or nearly 98% of the total IRS budget for this purpose.

(134) As a result of itsmissions and responsibilities, the Service's roles in combating terrorism and financial crimes aremanifold, extending to anti-terrorist financing. (135) These can be direct, through participation in relevantinteragency task forces and its own investigations of financial crimes, or indirect, through itsactivities and operations in seemingly unrelated areas. (Protective and security duties, for instance,might uncover terrorist financing arrangements behind potential assaults; or examination of identitytheft might disclose the use of credit cards by terrorist cells.)", "Even though the Secret Service no longer resides in the Treasury Department, the agency isstill connected to its previous departmental home and certain responsibilities.

One is that authoritative, detailed, and comprehensive information about the SecretService and its operations in the public record is lacking. This results from the high degree ofsecrecy and sensitivity surrounding them and agency operations. In addition, public submissionsfrom the Service itself or from its adoptive parent, the Department of Homeland Security, are usuallygeneral in scope, limited in detail, and short on specifics. (The Secret Service, however, doesprovide more information directly to Members and committees of Congress in executive session orotherwise in confidence, through reports, hearings, meetings, and briefings.)", "A second qualification is that the federal involvement in combating terrorist financing hasbeen and probably still is evolving, involving a number of different entities and connections amongthem. (As noted above, for example, Treasury's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligenceemerged only recently.) Changes over time have occurred, affecting organizational structure, agencyduties and operations, interagency coordinative arrangements, networks consisting of federal alongwith subnational and private organizations, and informal relationships. Similar changes might occuragain with the same impact.", "A third caveat is that actual practice might not conform to expected practice and that formalinstitutional arrangements and procedures might differ from informal undertakings. Consequently,some of the accounts in the public record might not adequately describe on-going interrelationships,activities, and operations; their scope and range; their effectiveness and results; or their comparativeimportance.", "Collectively, these qualifications have meaning for the Secret Service's role andresponsibilities in combating terrorist financing. These are not specified in detail in the publicrecord, a gap that leads to uncertainty and even some confusion about them. In addition, the rolesmay have been transformed since the Service's move into Homeland Security and out of Treasury,where the lead agency (and several related bureaus) are headquartered. The roles or practices maycontinue to change under certain circumstances: for instance, if Treasury's bureaus and officesincrease their responsibility and operations; if the reverse occurs, whereby TFI calls upon the SecretService for additional involvement; or if the Secret Service's own priorities are altered, to elevate,as an illustration, the protective mission while reducing criminal investigations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)(141)", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Bureau of Investigation is the lead agency in the Department of Justice (DOJ)for the dual mission of protecting U.S. national security and combating criminal activities.

The Division's Financial Crimes Section(FCS) and Money Laundering Unit (MLU) specialize in tracing illicit proceeds -- \"following themoney\" -- that criminals seek to hide in multiple transactions in legitimate commerce and finance. Indeed, the investigative techniques developed by the FCS were used to trace the movements andcommercial transactions of the 9/11 hijackers.

The Department of Justice/FBI jurisdiction and authority to investigate cases of terrorist financingas crime distinct from money laundering date back to 1994 with the enactment of the first \"materialsupport\" legislation. (150) The material support laws were subsequently enhanced withthe enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act. (151) A variety of other legal tools are also used in the investigationand prosecution of terrorist financing activity.

Due to thesensitive, if not classified, role of some of the activities of the TFOS, there is little publicly availableinformation about the resources dedicated to this function at the FBI. In terms of the types ofprofessionals working within TFOS, FBI testimony indicates that there is a mixture of financialintelligence analysts and law enforcement officers. According to the FBI, in order to analyzeexisting financial and other information for counterterrorism purposes, TFOS, working with theCounterterrorism Section of the Department of Justice's Criminal Division, works to identifypotential electronic data sources controlled by domestic and foreign governments, as well as theprivate sector that may be valuable in its efforts. Once these are identified, TFOS attempts to createthe legally appropriate protocols to access and analyze this information in order to provide reactiveand proactive operational, predictive and educational support to investigators and prosecutors.According to the FBI, some of the projects and initiatives associated with information technologyexploitation include:", "The Proactive Exploits Group (PEG) . This TFOS group serves as a proactiveunit by working closely with document exploitation personnel to generate investigative leads forTFOS and other FBI investigative divisions. The PEG has conducted a survey of available datamining and link analysis software for use in TFOS activities.", "The Suspicious Activity Report Project . The SAR Project attempts to identifypotential terrorists through the mining of existing databases for \"...key words, patterns, individuals,entities, accounts and specific numeric indicators (i.e. Social Security...passport, telephoneetc.).\" (155) Thisresearch and analysis is conducted independent of whether the reported SAR has a nexus toterrorism.

According to the FBI, theTFOS has developed substantial contacts domestically and internationally that have enhanced itsaccess to near real-time information to advance the TFOS mission. Domestically, through outreachto the private sector, and with appropriate legal process, the FBI has access to, among otherinformation: \"...Banking, Credit/Debit Card Sector, Money Services Businesses,Securities/Brokerages Sector, Insurance, Travel, Internet Service Providers, and theTelecommunications Industry.\" (157) Internationally, TFOS investigators have supported numerousinvestigations which have led to the exchange of investigative personnel between the FBI andnumerous foreign countries or agencies. For example, according to the FBI, the United Kingdom,Switzerland, Canada, Germany, and Europol have all detailed investigators to the TFOS ontemporary duty. (158) Moreover, the State Department has requested that the FBI-TFOS lead an interagency team toprovide a TFOS-developed training curriculum to other countries requesting assistance in furtherdeveloping their existing investigative programs, legislative and legal regimes, and financialoversight controls to counter terrorist financing.", "FBI Measures of Success and RelatedAccomplishments. A review of publicly available FBI documents and officialtestimony suggests that the FBI measures its success in countering terrorist financing throughnumerous measures, to include the deterrence, disruption, or prevention of terrorist attacks; theidentification of previously unknown (\"sleeper\") terrorist suspects, terrorist organizations, andterrorist supporters; enhancing the understanding of a terrorist attack after it has occurred byanalyzing existing financial information gathered through the case and liaison; the development andgeneration of additional terrorism leads and investigations; the number of arrests, indictments andconvictions for activities in violation of the aforementioned and related statutes; the closure ofdomestic and international non-governmental organizations and charities with linkages to designatedterrorist organizations; and the seizure and/or blockage of terrorist assets. Given theseself-determined criteria for assessing performance, in public remarks, the FBI has articulated itsvarious successes in working with foreign and domestic law enforcement and intelligence agenciesto achieve its goals. Some of the often cited FBI successes in terrorist financing include (1) thedisruption and dismantlement of a Hezbollah procurement and fund-raising network relying oninterstate cigarette smuggling; (2) FBI support to a U.S. Treasury, Office of Foreign Asset Controlinvestigation that led to the blocking of assets of the Holy Land Foundation for Relief andDevelopment (HLF), which, according to the FBI, had been linked to the funding of Hamas terroristactivities, and (3) the shutting down of the U.S.-based Office of the Benevolence InternationalFoundation (BIF) after it was determined through FBI-OFAC cooperation that the charity wasfunneling money to Al Qaeda. (159) ", "According to the FBI, in order to address some of the concerns raised by the GAO withrespect to alternative financing mechanisms, it has developed intelligence requirements related toknown indicators of terrorist financing activity. (160) Theoretically, such requirements should cause the FBI's fieldcollectors (largely its special agents located at the 56 FBI field offices (161) ) to pro-actively collectintelligence on alternative mechanisms of financing terrorism. Secondly, according to the FBI, theTFOS Program Management and Coordination Unit (PCMU) has been tasked with \"tracking variousfunding mechanisms used by different subjects on ongoing investigations -- to include alternativefinancing mechanisms.\" (162) ", "Relationships to and Coordination with OtherAgencies. The FBI participates in, and leads some, domestic and internationalgroups to coordinate activities related primarily to terrorist financing. The interagency FBI-led JointTerrorism Task Forces, of which there are currently 100, play the lead role in investigating terroristfinancing activities. In addition to representatives from other federal law enforcement agencies, theJTTFs also include participation of many state and local law enforcement officers. Domestically, theFBI is a participant in the National Security Council's Policy Coordination Committee on TerroristFinancing (established in late 2001) which meets at least once a month to coordinate the UnitedStates Government's activities to counter terrorism financing. It is also a participant in the StateDepartment-chaired Terrorist Financing Working Group which identifies, prioritizes and assiststhose countries whose financial systems may be vulnerable to manipulation for terrorist purposes;other agencies participating in this group include the Departments of the Treasury and HomelandSecurity. ", "In May of 2003, a Memorandum of Agreement was signed by the Attorney General andSecretary of Homeland Security to de-conflict and clarify the terrorist financing activities of the FBIand DHS, particularly the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Under the MOA,generally, the FBI was designated the lead agency for the investigation of terrorist financing, andDHS was enabled to focus its law enforcement activities on protecting the integrity of the financialsystem. A process was established whereby existing DHS terrorist financing investigations (largelypart of legacy U.S. Customs' \"Operation Green Quest\") would be reviewed jointly to determine ifthere was a nexus to terrorism. If a joint determination was made by the FBI and DHS that there wasa nexus to terrorism, the case would be transferred to the FBI-led JTTF. Because DHS - ICE lawenforcement officers are on the JTTF, they would continue to play an important role in theinvestigation. If a joint determination was made that there was no nexus to terrorism, the case wouldremain with DHS- ICE, and likely become a part of \"Operation Cornerstone,\" ICE's effort to identifyand work to resolve vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system that may be exploited by terrorists.", "Internationally, in addition to its 51 Legal Attache Offices which conduct law enforcementand intelligence liaison, (163) the FBI formed the International Terrorism Financing WorkingGroup (ITFWG).

In 1988, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly passed the Vienna Convention Against IllicitTraffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (the Vienna Convention), the firstinternational agreement to criminalize money laundering. An important component of theagreement, some argue, is that it includes a mutual assistance clause mandating that governmentscollaborate with each other in money laundering investigations. (175) In order to facilitatecooperation on anti-money laundering issues among various nations and to help countries implementthe Vienna Convention, the Group of Seven nations created the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)in 1989.", "Several recent conventions on terrorist financing have been negotiated.

As of June 2005, 132 countries had signed theconvention and 117 were full parties to the agreement. (176) The convention requires each country to criminalize thefunding of terrorist activities under its domestic law and to seize or freeze funds used or allocatedfor terrorist purposes. Countries must ensure that their domestic laws require financial institutionsto implement measures that identify, impede, and prevent the flow of terrorist funds. Finally,countries are required to prosecute or extradite individuals suspected of involvement in thefinancing of terrorism and to cooperate with other countries in the investigation and/or prosecutionof those suspected of engaging in these acts.

It focused on areas of financing, intelligence sharing, and limiting terrorists' ability totravel. The resolution also required states to criminalize Al Qaeda financial activities and to freezethe group's monetary assets; it mandated exchanges of intelligence, among other arrangements.UNSCR 1373 was passed under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, making compliance mandatory forall member-states and giving the Security Council enforcement powers.

These sanctions require U.N. member states, among other things, to freeze assets ofpersons and entities listed by the 1267 committee. The Council has revised and strengthened thesesanctions since 1999. On January 30, 2004, the Council, in Resolution 1526 (2004), furtherstrengthened and expanded the Committee's mandate by requiring that states freeze economicresources derived from properties owned or controlled by Al Qaeda and the Taliban and also thatstates cut the flow of funds derived from non-profit organizations and alternative/informal remittancesystems to terrorist groups.", "Financial Action Task Force (FATF). TheFinancial Action Task Force is an inter-governmental body that develops and promotes policies andstandards to combat money laundering (the so-called Forty Recommendations ) and terroristfinancing ( Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing ).

In 2001, FATF released Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing . These are very focused, and reflect a more nuanced understanding of how terrorist groups raise andtransmit funds. The eight recommendations are: ", "1. Take immediate steps to ratify and implement the relevant United Nationsinstruments.", "2. Criminalize the financing of terrorism, terrorist acts and terrorist organizations.", "3. Freeze and confiscate terrorist assets.", "4. Report suspicious transactions linked to terrorism.", "5. Provide the widest possible range of assistance to other countries' law enforcementand regulatory authorities for terrorist financing investigations.", "6.

In March 2004, the IMF and World Bankagreed to make the pilot program permanent. Experience under the pilot program with bothassessments and with technical assistance considerably deepened collaboration between the IMF andWorld Bank and FATF and the FATF Style Regional Bodies (FSRBs). Recommendations for theIMF and World Bank on how to improve monitoring include the need for close coordination withFATF and FATF-Style Regional Bodies on the timing of assessments, more equitable sharing of theassessment burden among agencies, and broadening the responsibilities of IMF and World Bank stafffor the supervision and integration of assessment missions to insure comprehensive and high qualityassessments.

Efforts tofurther regulate and introduce transparency into the global financial system are welcome steps; yetthey will not completely reduce terrorists' striking capacity because most of the proposed measurescannot with certainty separate out terrorists from other types of lawbreakers. Terrorists' ability toexploit non-bank mechanisms of moving and storing value, as well as their decentralizedself-supporting network of cells represent additional challenges to law enforcement.", "These challenges and concerns lead to numerous policy questions that may be relevant forCongress as it debates both a U.S. strategy to counter terrorist financing and to reorganize the U.S.government in order to best implement this strategy. Among those questions are: ", "Should the U.S. strategy emphasize freezing assets or following financialtrails? In the wake of the 9/11 report, this does not appear to be answered. More importantly, whoshould author the U.S. Government terrorist financing strategy? Although the current terroristfinancing strategy is drawn up by the State Department, many would argue that Treasury maintainsmore expertise on the issue and, having prepared the previous Anti-Money Laundering Strategies,would be better suited to draft a national counterterrorist financing strategy. ", "Does the current architecture of the U.S. Government display clear jurisdictionamong the various federal departments and agencies involved in the fight against terrorist financing? The preceding analysis points to many possible overlaps among the various investigatory agencies(FBI/DOJ and DHS) as well as between Treasury and State in policy setting and providing technicalassistance to foreign allies. To what extent has the Administration analyzed each federal agencybudget allocation for combating terrorist financing to reconcile duplication of efforts?", "What future efforts can be put in place to further inter-departmental andinter-agency coordination on both policy-setting and enforcement? How well are the functions of thepanoply of new and legacy departments and agencies being coordinated? Who is best suited tocoordinate these functions? ", "How well is the congressional oversight mechanism designed to assess federalperformance on countering terrorist financing? The Senate Banking and Finance Committees agreedto joint jurisdiction over the Treasury's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. Several otherCommittees have potential relevance in the overall fight against terrorist financing. Reform ofcongressional jurisdiction is an historically tricky issue, yet some argue that reevaluating howCongress oversees the fight against terrorism and terrorist financing may lead to more effectiveExecutive Branch action. ", "Considering terrorists' increased use of alternative remittance systems, is thereany way to regulate these practices? What would the costs be to register all informalmoney-transmitters and bring them in line with USA PATRIOT Act requirements? Many smallremittance services cater to immigrant communities without reliable access to the formal bankingsector. Making alternative remittance systems illegal is likely impractical and could create a swellof resentment among the immigrant population in the United States. If the U.S. Government wantsto license and regulate alternative remittance systems, some say it may be necessary to offer fundsand technical assistance to small remittance providers to help insure theircompliance.", "How effectively is the United States cooperating with other countries andinsuring their cooperation in implementing and enforcing national regulations to restrict terroristfinancing? If a U.S. bank, charity, or remittance system is based in the U.S., or has U.S. operations,it is subject to U.S. jurisdiction. When such entities lie outside U.S. jurisdiction, the United Statesis often at the mercy of other governments to first enact legislation making terrorist financing illegaland, more importantly, rigorously enforce this legislation.
