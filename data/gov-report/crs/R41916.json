Deputy Assistant Secretary Nilsson testified that the Obama Administration prioritized revising the categories which have the greatest effect on U.S. military interoperability with allied governments.", "To date, the executive branch has completed transferring items in the following categories from the USML to the CCL: ", "Category IV (launch vehicles, missiles, rockets, torpedoes, bombs, mines, and other military explosive devices; Category V (explosives and energetic materials, propellants, incendiary agents and their constituents); Category VI (vessels of war and naval equipment); Category VII (tanks and military vehicles); Category VIII (aircraft and associated equipment); Category IX (military training equipment); Category X (protective personal equipment and shelters); Category XI (military electronics); Category XII (fire control, range finder, optical and guidance and control equipment); Category XIII (auxiliary military equipment); Category XIV (toxicological agents, including chemical agents, biological agents, and associated equipment); Category XV(spacecraft and related articles); Category XVI (nuclear weapons related articles); Category XVIII (directed energy weapons); and Category XX (submersible vessels and oceanic equipment).", "The State Department also created a new USML Category XIX (gas turbine engines). Then-Deputy Assistant Secretary Nilsson stated in September 2017 that items would not be moved from USML Categories I-III (firearms, close assault weapons and combat shotguns, guns and armament, ammunition/ordnance) to the CCL until 2018. The executive branch posted proposed rules concerning movement of items from these categories on May 14, 2018. On February 8, 2019, Representative Norma Torres introduced H.R. 1134 , the Prevent Crime and Terrorism Act of 2019, which would prohibit the President from removing \"any item\" from \"category I, II, or III\" of the USML. Similarly, on February 12, 2019, Senator Robert Menendez introduced S. 459 , the Stopping the Traffic in Overseas Proliferation of Ghost Guns Act, which states that \"the President may not remove any firearm, or technical information relating to such firearm\" from the USML.", "A final rule on a new \"0Y521\" classification series became effective on April 12, 2013. This series is used for items that are neither identified under an existing ECCN nor controlled under an existing U.S. or multilateral export control regime, but warrant control for foreign policy reasons or because they could provide a significant military or intelligence advantage. According to the EAR, such items \"are typically emerging technologies.\" BIS has subsequently added new items to this series. Items so classified \"must be re-classified under another ECCN within one calendar year from the date they are listed\" in the relevant part of the EAR. If they are not reclassified, the items \"are designated as EAR99 items unless either the CCL is amended to impose a control on such items under another ECCN or the ECCN 0Y521 classification is extended.\" BIS may extend this classification \"for two one-year periods, provided that the U.S. Government has submitted a proposal to the relevant multilateral regime(s) to obtain multilateral controls over the item.\" BIS may further extend the classification \"only if the Under Secretary for Industry and Security makes a determination that such extension is in the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.\"", "According to the Obama Administration, the USML would contain \"only those items that provide at least a significant military or intelligence applicability that warrant the controls the AECA requires.\" The reconstituted Munitions List may then be aligned with the CCL by adopting its A-E commodity organization structure and adding two additional categories: F and G for ITAR specific controls. As a result of this alignment, each USML category will be divided into seven groups: A\u2014equipment, assemblies, and components; B\u2014test, inspection, and production equipment; C\u2014materials; D\u2014software; E\u2014technology; F\u2014defense services; and G\u2014manufacturing and production authorizations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "\"600 Series\"", "paragraphs": ["As a result of the bright line process, the Obama Administration moved some USML items to the CCL.

Section 38(f)(6) of the AECA requires that \"any major defense equipment\" on the 600 series \"shall continue to be subject to\" several \"notification and reporting requirements\" of the AECA and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (P.L. 87-195).", "In order to comply with Section 38(f), the manner in which USML items transferred to the CCL are to be controlled is described in a proposed rulemaking on July 15, 2011, and is part of the \"mega rule\" issued on April 16, 2013. It involves the creation of a \"600 Series\" subcategory of Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs) for each category on the CCL. This new series is populated by items that are judged not to need the relatively-stricter controls mandated under the USML. Items moved to the CCL in this manner require a license to all destinations except Canada. All items controlled pursuant to multilateral control regimes retain their existing controls. In addition, \"600 Series\" items will be subject to a general policy of denial to countries subject to a U.S. or U.N. arms embargo. Such items are also subject to the prohibition on Defense Department procurement of \"goods and services\" on the USML \"from any Communist Chinese military company\" mandated by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 ( P.L. 109-163 ).", "The rule also places restrictions on the extent to which certain license exceptions can be applied. End-use items transferred to the 600 Series would be eligible for the recently announced Strategic Trade Authorization (STA) license exception (described below) only after a determination is jointly made by the State, Defense, and Commerce Departments that such an exception should be made available for the item in question. Most parts, components, and accessories transferred under this process would be automatically eligible for an STA license exception for exports to the governments of STA-eligible countries. Items expressly defined as \"less significant\" would be eligible for a license exception for destinations other than those controlled for antiterrorism reasons. \"600 Series\" items would also be eligible for other preexisting license exceptions.", "The U.S. control status of parts and components also is addressed by the 600 Series. Under the EAR, the license requirement is based on the finished product, generally without regard to its parts and components. However, a foreign product containing more than 25% controlled U.S. content (10% controlled U.S. content in the case of a transaction to a country identified as a state sponsor of terrorism) may require a reexport license from the United States. However, for ITAR-controlled items, DDTC has employed a jurisdictional interpretation known as a \"see-through\" rule, which subjects to ITAR control U.S.-origin parts and components incorporated into end products manufactured overseas. For items migrating to the 600 Series, a 25% rule applies, but no de minimus amount would apply to embargoed destinations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "\"Specially Designed\"", "paragraphs": ["To facilitate the transfer of items from the USML to the CCL, the Obama Administration proposed a new definition of \"specially designed.\" As noted above, the Administration sought to move away from the design-intent standard of the USML and the use of the catch-all phrase \"specifically designed\" for military use to subject parts and components to ITAR jurisdiction. The Obama Administration argued that new definition was necessary because \"specifically designed\" in the USML did not have the same meaning as the term \"specially designed\" which appears in the CCL and also in various multilateral control lists. The Administration also argued that removing the term(s) entirely by enumerating each part and component being moved from the USML to the CCL was infeasible. ", "The Obama Administration published its final rule on the definition of \"specially designed\" on April 16, 2013.
