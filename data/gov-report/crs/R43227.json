An initial focus on science has expanded to encompass both mitigation and adaptation, involving at least 18 agencies plus the Executive Office of the President. The work supported is conducted by universities, national laboratories, private contractors, non-governmental organizations, and some federal agencies. Most of the funding has supported scientific and, since the 1990s, technological research and development (R&D). ", "Given uncertainties regarding the risks of future climate change, the federal climate strategy has aimed at improving the information available for decision-making and reducing the costs of technologies that could help abate the risks. A growing component has been federal planning and efforts to adapt to climate change. Complementing the science and technology initiatives have been regulatory actions; programs to build capacity in private, state, local, and international entities to address climate change; and tax incentives to stimulate deployment of low greenhouse gas-emitting technologies. Many of these initiatives are identified in the Obama Administration's recently announced Climate Action Plan, which stated three main prongs:", "cutting carbon pollution in America; preparing the United States for the impacts of climate change; and leading international efforts to address global climate change.", "Federal funding for these activities described in this report differs across these priorities and has shifted over time. Policy instruments and programs depend on funding to differing degrees to be effective; some rely on large amounts of direct federal investment (e.g., in federal R&D) while others primarily require support for administrative expenses. ", "As congressional and public debate continues with regard to whether and how to address climate change, the priorities for federal funding are likely to evolve further. Members of Congress have expressed a range of views about funding for climate change-related activities. Some question the relative priorities among initiatives or whether the risks of climate change merit the magnitude of federal expenditures and of federal policies on the economy in exchange for benefits that would mostly accrue to future generations, people in other countries, and stability of Earth systems. Other Members point to scientific and economic research to underpin their support for increasing funding to address climate change. Congressional debate on climate change funding takes place in the broader context of stark choices among competing fiscal demands.

The amounts are reported by OMB, and occasionally by individual departments and agencies where noted. CRS relies on OMB and agency sources of data since most climate-related funding is appropriated at the subaccount level and therefore is not directly identifiable in legislation and committee reports. OMB has produced a \"budget cross-cut\" for climate change activities when it has been required by language in appropriations bills. Individual agencies often report funding for specific programs, but that information may not be comprehensive or comparable to information on funding for climate change activities in other programs or agencies. Further, when agencies cooperate on programs, double-counting of funding could occur if one were simply to add up what the agencies each report. Some of the OMB and agency sources may report inconsistent or incomplete data. It is CRS's judgment that the amounts in the following tables likely underestimate total federal funding relating to climate change for the period, perhaps on the order of tens of millions of dollars (i.e., not billions). Information is not available for all programs for all years, as explained below.

In the request, 23% would be for science (the U.S. Global Change Research Program or USGCRP), 68% for \"clean energy\" technology development and deployment, 8% for international assistance, and 1% for adapting to climate change. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) also reports energy tax provisions that may reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions would reduce tax revenues by $9.8 billion.", "The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) also reports estimates of Energy Tax Provisions and Energy Grants in Lieu of Tax Provisions that may stimulate deployment of low GHG-emitting technologies. These fiscal incentives serve as exemptions to the baseline tax structure, and usually result in a reduction in the amount of tax owed. A review of these provisions is beyond the scope of this CRS report, though the OMB estimates are provided in Table 4 .", "Minor inconsistencies sometimes exist in alternative reports on funding, perhaps due to rescissions or reprogramming, or because a program may be cast as climate change-related in some contexts but not in others. The reported initiatives are cross-agency \"roll-ups\" of programs and funding in the agencies, and information on some programs is available only to the degree that the agency has reported funding to OMB or Congress. Some activities, particularly those that consider or address potential impacts of climate change on federal programs or assets, likely existed prior to their being identified as climate change-related, so that funding may have occurred prior or in addition to activities listed in these tables. Other caveats about comparing or examining possible trends in funding are described in more detail in CRS Report RL33817, Climate Change: Federal Program Funding and Tax Incentives , by [author name scrubbed]. ", "This CRS report also provides a series of reported enacted budget authority and tax provisions for climate change programs since FY2001, in Table 4 . One may presume that past numbers are increasingly inconsistent with present accounting the farther back in time, for reasons explained above. Nonetheless, the general magnitude of overall spending and the shifts in categories of spending may be useful to some. Figure 2 shows those estimates of historical budget authority since FY2001 to the FY2014 request, adjusted for inflation (i.e., in constant 2012 dollars). ", "Through most of the 1990s, most federal funding identified to address climate change was directed at improving the science, under the U.S. GCRP. As Figure 2 shows, by FY2001, investment in climate-related energy technology research, development, and deployment (Clean Energy Technologies) surpassed science (the U.S. GCRP) as the largest component of federal activities and has continued to increase its share since then; the share in FY2013 enacted budget authority shrunk slightly from FY2012, however. The one-time investment in climate-related technologies contained in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-5 ) was notably large and still constitutes more than one-fifth of all identified federal expenditures since FY2001 (including the FY2014 request). Adaptation to climate change has been added to the identified federal expenditures since FY2010, but remains too small to be seen as a share on the time series figure.

Thirteen departments and agencies participate in the USGCRP.

Consequently, the large majority of CET budget authority has been in the Department of Energy. ", "The CET initiative is a recent iteration of the Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) that was formally established administratively under President George W. Bush, which itself included a number of existing programs. The FY2014 budget request calls for an investment of nearly $7.9 billion in support of CET, a 30% and 37% increase in comparison to the enacted FY2012 and current FY2013 budget authority, respectively. These funds reflect the current Administration's priority for new technologies as a means to facilitate future GHG reductions and meet the President's GHG emissions reduction targets, in the range of 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 and approximately 83% below 2005 levels by 2050. Meeting the 2050 target would likely require radical change from the currently prevalent energy system.", "The Department of Energy coordinated the CCTP inter-agency effort through a central office.

Federal strategy on climate change largely reflects the aggregation of a variety of existing programs, presidential initiatives, and congressionally directed activities. Presidential initiatives have been built largely from existing programs, and agencies have contributed to shared program goals using existing resources and expertise. Priorities tend to be based on departmental missions and the degree of support for the input activities. As the debate continues over appropriate strategies to address climate change, the needs and priorities for funding are likely to evolve further.", "Federal budget for climate change-related programs is primarily aimed at investment and tax provisions aimed at stimulating energy technologies that may reduce GHG emissions. The Clean Energy Technologies category represents 68% of the President's request for FY2014. Over the period since FY2001, including the FY2014 request, these technology programs constitute more than 70% of all funding for identified climate change-related programs (excluding tax provisions). By itself, the one-time injection of resources in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-5 )\u2014almost entirely for energy technology development\u2014is nearly one-quarter the cumulative spending from FY2001 through FY2013.

Although activities in the federal agencies have expanded, especially since 2009, little of this activity is reported in OMB's budget cross-cut. This omission probably reflects the relatively low level of effort in most agencies, and that efforts are typically add-ins to wider programs rather than stand-alone activities. For example, grants for coastal zone planning may incorporate effects of potential sea level rise and storm surges as one consideration among many in those plans. Only the Department of the Interior, which has a department-wide effort to identify and address vulnerabilities to the assets it manages, explicitly reports adaptation funds. This is less than 1% of the FY2013 funding across agencies.", "Interpreting how funding relates to levels of effort to address climate change is challenged by several reporting issues. Identifying actual funding for climate change activities is clouded by several ongoing issues, including the following:", "the levels of aggregation of the budget request; changes in scope of what is reported; changes in accounting methods used over time; inconsistencies across agencies in defining and interpreting methods for reporting activities; lack of description by agencies for subaccount level climate change-related activities in their budget documentation; and omissions of reporting of some arguably climate-related activities in the overall program. ", "In light of these issues, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) investigated the Administration's reporting practices in 2005, 2006, and 2011. GAO recommended that the Administration provide greater clarity and consistency of reporting on federal funding for climate change activities. While some improvements were made following the 2006 GAO report, many issues persist, confounding analysis of climate change funding. The 2011 GAO report concluded that there were two key factors that \"complicate efforts to align funding with priorities\": (1) \"... federal officials do not have a shared understanding of strategic priorities\" and (2) \"... since mechanisms for aligning funding with priorities are nonbinding, they are limited when in conflict with agencies' own priorities.\" In addition, congressional priorities may differ from the President's goals and requests, further complicating alignment of goals and priorities.", "The funding data described in this report derive primarily from OMB's series of Reports to Congress on Federal Climate Change Expenditures published through the requirements in various appropriation laws passed from 2002 through 2008, 2010, and 2012. In response to language included in FY2012 appropriations, OMB released its latest report on August 28, 2013. It appears that OMB produces these budget cross-cuts only when required by legislation.
