{"id": "R44469", "title": "Hatch Act Restrictions on Federal Employees\u2019 Political Activities in the Digital Age", "released_date": "2016-04-13T00:00:00", "summary": ["Federal officers and employees historically have been subject to certain limitations when engaging in partisan political activities. Although they have always retained their right to vote and privately express political opinions, for most of the last century, they were prohibited from being actively involved in political management or political campaigns. At the beginning of the 20th century, civil service rules imposed a general ban on voluntary, off-duty participation in partisan politics by merit system employees. The ban prohibited employees from using their \"official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with an election or affecting the result thereof.\" These rules were eventually codified in 1939 and are commonly known as the Hatch Act.", "By the late 20th century, such broad restrictions were seen as unnecessary due to other changes in the nature of the federal workforce, including the advent of a more independent and merit-based civil service and adoption of increased protections for employees against coercion and retaliation. Accordingly, the Hatch Act was significantly amended in 1993 to relax the broad ban on political activities, and now allows most employees to engage in a wide range of voluntary, partisan political activities in their free time, while away from the federal workplace. Some employees may be subject to additional restrictions depending on the employing agency or an employee's specific position.", "The nature of the federal workforce and work environment has continued to evolve since these amendments, and new issues have arisen for congressional consideration in recent years. In particular, the increased use of technology has raised questions about how email and mobile communications may be regulated under the Hatch Act. The increased availability and use of smartphones may be seen as blurring an employee's time, either by using a personal device while working or using a government device while off-duty. Additionally, alternative work arrangements, for example, telework, have presented similar dilemmas in understanding how Hatch Act restrictions might be applied in the modern workplace.", "This report examines the history of regulation of federal employees' partisan political activity under the Hatch Act and related federal regulations. It discusses the scope of the application of these restrictions to different categories of employees and provides a background analysis of the general restrictions currently in place. Finally, it analyzes potential issues that have arisen and interpretations that have been offered related to the application of these restrictions to new platforms of activity, for example, email, social media, and telework."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Hatch Act Generally", "paragraphs": ["Federal law, commonly known as the Hatch Act, regulates certain government employees' participation in partisan political activities.

A general ban on voluntary, off-duty participation in partisan politics by merit system employees was instituted by executive order in 1907. Specifically, the executive order prohibited employees from using \"official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with an election or affecting the result thereof.\" Employees retained their right to vote and privately express political opinions, but were prohibited from taking \"active part in political management or in political campaigns.\"", "Known as Civil Service Rule 1, this restriction and all of the administrative interpretations under it were eventually codified in 1939 and made applicable to most federal executive branch employees under a law commonly known as the Hatch Act. Since 1940, state and local government employees whose official jobs are connected with activities that receive federal funding have come within the purview of a part of the federal Hatch Act regarding partisan political activities. ", "The Hatch Act and civil service restrictions were seen in some respects as protections of federal employees from coercion by higher level, politically appointed supervisors to engage in political activities against their will, as well as an effort by Congress and the Executive to assure a nonpartisan and evenhanded administration of federal laws and programs. With the advent of the modern, more independent and merit-based civil service, and the adoption of increased statutory and regulatory protections of federal employees against improper coercion and retaliation, the need for a broad ban on all voluntary, outside activities in politics as a means to protect employees was seen as less necessary and more restrictive of the rights of private expression of millions of citizens than was needed to accomplish the goals of the Hatch Act.", "Accordingly, Congress made significant changes to the law in the Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1993. The 1993 amendments allow most federal employees to engage in a wide range of voluntary, partisan political activities in their time off-duty, away from their federal jobs, and off of any federal premises. While many limitations on employees' political activity were removed, the amendments retained strict restrictions for some employees of designated agencies and provided more express statutory prohibitions on workplace politicking.", "Most recently, Congress made changes to the Hatch Act in the Hatch Act Modernization Act of 2012. These amendments did not include significant changes to the substantive prohibitions on federal employees' political activity. However, these amendments did change the status of employees of the District of Columbia, who previously were subject to Hatch Act restrictions but now are expressly excluded from coverage, and made changes to the mechanisms for enforcement of Hatch Act violations.

In other words, the manner in which an employee participates in political activity appears to be irrelevant to whether the activity is permissible. Thus, whether an employee meets with a subordinate in person or calls the subordinate over the phone to solicit contributions for a particular political activity, the employee could be in violation of the Hatch Act. Examples include the increased use of mobile devices (e.g., Blackberry, smartphones), incorporation of social media as a professional tool, and the growth of federal telework programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Email and Mobile Communications", "paragraphs": ["Although email has been a common tool in federal offices for decades, the prevalence of smartphones, both for personal and professional use, over the last decade has highlighted new issues in regulation of political activity under the Hatch Act. For instance, to what extent may an employee use his or her official email account or a personal account on a work computer or smartphone to engage in political activity? ", "Accordingly, OSC has offered guidance on the use of email to engage in political activity. In an advisory opinion, the agency examined an email sent by a federal employee entitled \"Who is Barack Obama?,\" which included a number of opinions about then-presidential candidate Obama that OSC found to be in violation of the Hatch Act. OSC noted that the email included \"very negative statements about Senator Barack Obama, specifically warn[ed] recipients to 'stay alert' about his candidacy, and stat[ed] that it has information recipients should consider in their 'choice.'\" The opinion appears to indicate that the source of the content is at least a consideration in the analysis, highlighting that the \"e-mail was not created by a federal employee. Rather, a federal employee received it and then forwarded it to others without adding any content.\" However, this notation has been considered irrelevant if the employee sends the email while on duty or in a federal workplace.", "While employees are permitted to receive partisan political emails to any account as well as forward an email from a government account to their own personal account, certain email activities are barred under Hatch Act restrictions. These include sending or forwarding a partisan political email while on duty or in a federal workplace. The prohibition applies to any account, meaning that employees are not only barred from sending such emails from their government accounts, but also prohibited from using personal accounts while at work, even if using their personal phone or tablet. Additionally, employees cannot send or forward such emails to subordinates, nor can they use email to send invitations to political fundraising events."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Social Media", "paragraphs": ["The increased use of mobile communications has expanded the opportunity not only for employees to call or email while in a work environment, but also for use of other applications that may be used to engage in political activity, particularly various outlets of social media. In both their personal and professional capacities, the federal workforce also relies more heavily on the use of social media now than ever. Accordingly, application of the Hatch Act to these methods of communication has been of particular interest.", "Under OSC guidance, employees may engage in political activity on social media, with some restrictions. All employees are barred from doing so while on duty or in the federal workplace, from using their official titles, or from recommending or soliciting campaign contributions. Further restricted employees also must refrain from posting or linking to campaign or other partisan material, sharing Facebook pages of campaigns or other partisan groups, or retweeting posts from such entities' Twitter accounts. Specific rules apply with regard to social media contacts between supervisors and subordinates, which permit statements directly generally from a supervisor's account, but prohibit statements directed at subordinates in particular. Furthermore, OSC has identified some limitations on the biographical content of users' accounts, such as use of official title, photographs indicating political preferences, and profile information.", "OSC has announced a number of disciplinary measures related to these new platforms of activity after investigations into some federal employees' activities revealed violations of applicable prohibitions on political activities. In one case, OSC \"intended to pursue prosecution\" of an employee who used Twitter to advocate for a candidate and to solicit contributions. The employee had issued over 30 tweets but resigned before the prosecution moved forward. In another case, an employee at the Federal Election Commission (FEC) resigned after evidence showed that the employee had issued \"dozens of partisan political tweets\" and participated in an \"internet broadcast via webcam from an FEC facility, criticizing the Republican Party and then-Presidential candidate Mitt Romney.\" OSC barred the employee from employment in the executive branch for two years in that case. In both of these examples, specific details of the settlements reached were not released. For instance, it is not clear whether the employees used a personal Twitter account or an official account to engage in the restricted activities.

Telework has raised several questions with regard to the applicability of the Hatch Act. In congressional testimony, OSC explained that a significant number of employees work from home while using government-issued equipment. Thus, application of Hatch Act restrictions to teleworking employees could be analyzed under several possible frameworks: (1) determination of whether the employee is on duty; (2) clarification of whether the telework location is a federal workplace; and (3) potential expansion of the prohibition on the use of government vehicles to include other government equipment (e.g., laptops, smartphones).", "Current law does not identify which of these frameworks may be most appropriate, but OSC guidance indicates that \"[f]ederal employees are considered 'on duty' during telecommuting hours.\" OSC has previously recommended that Congress consider clarifying these definitions as a matter of legislative authority rather than relying on the administrative regulations and interpretation. It suggested that \"extending the definition of the federal workplace to an employee's home would be inappropriate,\" and noted the statute's silence with regard to government resources other than vehicles. Accordingly, it suggested that \"[a]gencies should be encouraged to develop clear computer-usage and government equipment policies\" including the use of official email addresses.
