These investigations were prompted by the sworn statements of employees from several large mortgage servicers and other evidence that surfaced in various foreclosure-related litigation that raised concerns that the companies were systematically engaged in mortgage documentation and procedural improprieties, especially when handling mortgages in default. These alleged transgressions included signing affidavits without personal knowledge of the facts presented in the legal documents submitted to courts to support the right to foreclose; backdating mortgage documents to fabricate evidence to give the appearance of compliance with state foreclosure requirements; failing to adhere to notarization requirements for foreclosure-related documents filed with courts; losing mortgage paperwork; assessing excessive fees against borrowers; failing to properly account for borrower mortgage payments; and failing to properly consider borrowers for eligibility in mortgage modification and other loss mitigation programs. Concerns about these illicit acts provoked a number of state and federal regulators to initiate multiple investigations, enforcement actions, lawsuits, and legal settlement negotiations.", "Of particular relevance to this report, all 50 state attorneys general, the attorney general for the District of Columbia, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) initiated an investigation into foreclosure-related state and federal law violations by the nation's top five mortgage servicers.

Notably, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010, the federal banking regulators began on-site examinations of the foreclosure processes and governance protocols of the 14 largest U.S. mortgage servicers. The regulators reviewed a sampling of mortgage files for which there were foreclosure actions pending during calendar years 2009 and 2010. The examinations revealed \"critical weaknesses in [the] servicers' foreclosure governance processes, foreclosure document preparation processes, and oversight and monitoring of third-party vendors, including foreclosure attorneys.\" As a result of these findings, the banking regulators, in April 2011, entered into binding consent orders with all 14 mortgage servicers and several of the third-party service providers that the servicers used in various ways during foreclosure processes (hereinafter, the \"Federal Banking Consent Orders\"). Numerous aspects of the Federal Banking Consent Orders overlap with the terms of the National Mortgage Settlement.

The Servicing Standards also require the servicers to take steps to ensure that they are adhering to the mortgage-related protections of the SCRA, which are discussed more fully below. The Servicing Standards of the settlement generally only apply to the owner-occupied, single-family, residential mortgages that are serviced by the five mortgage companies.

The Consumer Relief provisions of the agreements require the servicers to provide homeowners principal reductions and other types of mortgage modifications, short sales, refinancings, and similar mortgage-related relief. The agreements require that each servicer provide minimum levels of Consumer Relief, referred to as the \"Commitment Amount.\" The combined minimum Commitment Amount equals approximately $20 billion of relief. Servicers earn varying levels of credit towards the Commitment Amount for each type of relief provided based on a complex scoring system explained in Exhibit D-1 of the agreements. The scoring system is structured to encourage servicers to deliver types of relief that are deemed most beneficial to consumers and to do so sooner rather than later. For example, servicers generally will get $1.00 of credit for every $1.00 of principal forgiveness on first lien mortgages, but they will only receive $0.10 of credit for every $1.00 of waived deficiency claims against borrowers. As a result, servicers likely will not get a dollar-for-dollar credit for the gross amount of relief provided.", "The Consumer Relief terms of the settlement generally only apply to the owner-occupied, single-family, residential mortgages that are owned and serviced by the five mortgage companies.
