Such crimes include crimes of \"moral turpitude\"; crimes involving controlled substances; certain firearm offenses; and crimes related to espionage, sabotage, and related offenses. Yet the term \"criminal alien\" is not specifically defined in immigration law or regulation, and people use it to refer to several different types of noncitizen offenders. At the broadest level, a \"criminal alien\" is any noncitizen who has ever been convicted of a crime in the United States . This report adopts this broad definition unless otherwise noted. (See Appendix A for a glossary of additional related terms.)", "Criminal aliens can be further distinguished by legal status, which in turn affects removability. Unauthorized aliens have made up roughly half of all U.S. noncitizens in recent years. The unauthorized alien population includes not only persons who entered without inspection or overstayed the terms of their temporary visas but also persons who have what some refer to as a \"quasi-legal\" status (e.g., temporary protected status, parole, deferred action) that affords them relief from immediate removal. Hence, not all unauthorized aliens living in the United States are subject to removal. Most unauthorized aliens, however, are removable; but few have been convicted of a crime and are classified as criminal aliens (unlawful presence in the United States itself is a civil violation, not a criminal offense).", "Three groups of criminal aliens can be distinguished. ", "All criminal aliens include both unauthorized aliens, most of whom are potentially removable, and legal aliens who may or may not be removable depending on specific crimes committed. This population contains the set of criminal aliens who are removable on the basis of specific crimes committed. Criminal aliens who have been convicted of removable criminal offenses are subject to removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) even if they are otherwise legally present. For example, a legal permanent resident (LPR) convicted of cocaine possession is subject to removal, but an LPR convicted of public intoxication is not. This population also includes aggravated felons. Criminal aliens who have been convicted of aggravated felonies are ineligible for most forms of relief from removal and are ineligible to be readmitted to the United States. ", "As noted above, all three of these subpopulations\u2014criminal aliens, removable criminal aliens, and aggravated felons\u2014comprise an unknown mix of legally present noncitizens and unauthorized aliens. ", "In addition, criminal aliens can be distinguished by whether they are currently incarcerated in federal and state prisons and local jails. Accordingly, the criminal alien population can include noncitizens convicted of crimes but who are not incarcerated, noncitizens convicted of crimes who are currently incarcerated, and noncitizens who have ever been convicted of crimes in the past, who have served their sentences, and who have been released from prison and reside in the United States.

This issue is complicated by the lack of data and published estimates on the criminal alien population. CRS is not aware of any authoritative current estimate for the total criminal alien population . DHS has produced its own estimates of the removable criminal alien population , a subgroup of the total criminal alien population. In 2013, ICE published estimates indicating that approximately 900,000 aliens were arrested for crimes every year; that approximately 550,000 criminal aliens convicted of crimes exited law enforcement custody every year; and that 1.9 million removable criminal aliens currently resided in the United States.", "This CRS report presents data on authoritative published measures that quantify one portion of the criminal alien population\u2014the noncitizen population incarcerated in federal and state prisons and local jails.

State prison data also come from annually published BJS reports that compile mid-year and year-end data collected by the NPS program from the correctional departments of all 50 states. Local jail data come from an annual BJS survey, the Annual Survey of Jails , from which it creates national-level estimates of the number of inmates incarcerated in local jails. In addition, it conducts a complete count of the local jail population every five years through its Census of Jails . Together, these two local jail counts provide a consistent annual series of the total number of persons incarcerated in local jails. ", " Table 1 indicates that as of December 31, 2013, a total of 2,308,158 prisoners (U.S. citizens and noncitizens) were incarcerated: 215,866 in federal prisons; 1,361,084 in state prisons; and 731,208 in local jails. The 142,463 noncitizens reported in federal and state prisons and local jails at year-end 2013 represented 6.2% of the total incarcerated population. ", "Noncitizen inmates comprised 23.5% of the total federal prison population, 3.5% of the total state prison population, and 6.0% of the total local jail population in 2013. The large noncitizen proportion in federal prisons occurs for two reasons. First, immigration offenses, which are prosecuted at the federal level, represent a disproportionate share of federal offenses for which convicted individuals can be incarcerated in federal prisons. Second, data on noncitizens incarcerated in federal prisons are tabulated more accurately and completely than data on those incarcerated in state prisons and local jails, because federal data are collected consistently by one administrative unit using a single definition of noncitizen. Conversely, data collected on noncitizen status at the state level varies by state and in some cases is not reported at all, resulting in widespread underreporting of noncitizens. At the local level, such shortcomings are magnified over an even larger number of jail facilities and information collection policies. ", "Between 2002 and 2012, the noncitizen percentage of the incarcerated population (ranging from 6.7% to 7.4% over this period) mapped closely to the noncitizen percentage of the U.S. population overall (ranging from 6.3% to 7.6% over the same period). However, in 2013 several states, including California, did not report their noncitizen incarcerated populations, causing the total state-level noncitizen incarcerated population to be understated for that year, and making it difficult to compare with that of previous years. As a basis for comparison, noncitizens comprised 7.0% of the total U.S. population in 2013.

In contrast, state and local criminal justice jurisdictions differ in how they classify noncitizen prisoners, and not all collect such information; this creates substantial inconsistencies in data quality and completeness at the state and local level. ", "No single and consistent national enumeration of prisoners exists in the United States similar to the decennial census or the Current Population Survey\u2014much less one that focuses on subpopulations such as noncitizens.

Conversely, incarceration data understate the number of convicted criminals because they exclude persons on parole and persons sentenced to probation. For instance, of the 6,899,000 individuals included by BJS in its 2013 count of the total correctional population, 3,910,600 were on probation (56%), 853,200 were on parole (12%), and 2,220,300 were incarcerated in federal and state prisons or local jails (32%). ", "Caution must be exercised when examining incarceration data because changing numbers of incarcerations do not always indicate changes in the level of criminal activity. They may indicate changes in enforcement policy. For instance, a reduction in incarcerations for illegal immigration entry may stem from fewer persons attempting to enter the United States illegally, but it may also reflect changes in resources or enforcement priorities.

Consequently, this report limits its analysis to incarcerations.", "BJS's state and local incarceration data are based on the voluntary participation of each state's department of corrections and local jails. While all states contribute data to BJS on their prison population, states' definitions vary, posing challenges to estimating the size and character of the criminal alien population.

This total also includes some local jails but, because of their larger numbers, CAP does not have personnel in local facilities to the extent that it does in the federal and state prisons. In addition to onsite deployment of some ICE officers and agents, CAP uses video teleconference (VTC) equipment that connects jails and prisons to ICE's Detention Enforcement and Processing Offenders by Remote Technology (DEPORT) Center in Chicago, IL.

In 2008, appropriators expressed concern that ICE was \"losing perspective on which aliens represent the most significant threat to the nation's social and economic fabric\" and questioned \"why a significant number of illegal aliens serving sentences in State and local correctional facilities after conviction for various non-immigration crimes are still released from custody without efforts made to deport those who are deportable.\"", "Accordingly, appropriators increased funding for the existing Criminal Alien Program in FY2008; and set aside $200 million in additional funding for a program to \"improve and modernize efforts to identify aliens convicted of a crime, sentenced to imprisonment, and who may be deportable, and remove them from the United States once they are judged deportable.\" ICE applied the additional funding to develop the former Secure Communities. ", "Funding for CAP and Secure Communities increased 58-fold from just $6.6 million in FY2004 to $392.5 million in FY2010 and FY2011 before dropping to $317.2 million in FY2016. Altogether, the four criminal alien programs saw their funding grow from $23.4 million in FY2004 to a high of $690.2 million in FY2010 and FY2011, before declining to $497.7 million in FY2016."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State and Local Involvement in Interior Immigration Enforcement", "paragraphs": ["The \u00a7287(g) and former Secure Communities programs have leveraged state and local law enforcement agencies to identify and detain removable aliens, enhancing ICE's enforcement capacity but also raising concerns about police-community relations and civil rights.", "Proponents of cooperation between ICE and state and local law enforcement agencies have embraced interoperability and the \u00a7287(g) program as powerful tools to combat illegal immigration and associated criminal activity. They argue that it allows a relatively small number of ICE agents to leverage a much larger law enforcement group with closer links to local communities. They cite the efficiency of interoperability and \u00a7287(g), which used biographic and biometric records created when individuals are arrested and in law enforcement custody to check for possible immigration violations. They argue that both CAP components allow ICE to place additional immigration enforcement agents directly in state and local jurisdictions as well as identify unauthorized aliens who may have eluded interoperability detection because they entered the United States without inspection. ", "Detractors of such cooperation argue that the programs lack sufficient federal oversight and siphon local law enforcement resources away from preventing and prosecuting local crime. They contend that if the foreign born come to associate state and local law enforcement agencies with immigration enforcement, they will hesitate to report crimes or to cooperate in policing activities. Such behavior is expected especially among those who lack legal status and/or come from countries with weak public trust in law enforcement agencies. ", "They also argue that despite most law enforcement officers' best intentions, state and local law enforcement agency involvement with immigration law enforcement would increase the likelihood that biased officers will engage in racial profiling. They contend that by ensuring all arrestees are screened for immigration violations, jail enforcement programs may incentivize officers to arrest persons suspected of being unauthorized aliens based wholly or partly on racial or ethnic characteristics. ", "Such concerns about the \u00a7287(g) program surfaced soon after it was introduced. The program faced criticism because it delegated authority to state and local law enforcement agents over what many considered solely a federal responsibility and allowed such agents to use what was often perceived as undue discretion to shape immigration enforcement decisions. This resulted in different standards for immigration enforcement across jurisdictions, and raised civil liberties concerns. Such criticism prompted reviews by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the DHS Inspector General (IG), and an independent DHS Task Force. ", "In response, beginning in July 2009, ICE required participating law enforcement agencies to sign revised \u00a7287(g) Memorandums of Agreement (MOAs), which increased training requirements and ICE supervision, to continue participating in the program. Other program changes included new record-keeping requirements and other tools to prevent pretextual arrests and racial profiling, new training materials and new detainer forms to further reduce the risk of racial profiling and misuse of these enforcement programs, and the establishment of an Internal Advisory Committee to review and assess ICE field office recommendations on 287(g) applications. ", "Under these new procedures, ICE approved new \u00a7287(g) agreements more slowly beginning in 2010 and allowed its \u00a7287(g) task force agreements to expire by the end of 2012. Consequently, the total number of \u00a7287(g) agreements has diminished from a peak of 64 in 2012 to 32 in 2015. ICE's remaining \u00a7287(g) agreements that are currently active are all jail enforcement agreements, for which jail officers' powers under the agreements are limited to custodial settings. In the Secure Communities memorandum of November 20, 2014, the DHS Secretary directed the Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties to develop and implement a plan to monitor state and local law enforcement agencies participating in the transfer of foreign nationals to ICE.", "Some Members have questioned why the agency has reduced its use of \u00a7287(g) agreements. According to ICE, resistance to and legal action stemming from both the \u00a7287(g) and Secure Communities programs caused the agency to curtail the \u00a7287(g) program. Following implementation of the changes and safeguards described above, the agency may consider expanding the program in the future. Others have argued that revisions to the \u00a7287(g) program, which include meeting the physical infrastructure requirements under the Prison Rape Elimination Act, and a total of five weeks of required training imposes onerous costs that deter many smaller jurisdictions from participating in the program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Some of ICE's major immigration enforcement programs that target criminal aliens contain components that have been controversial with both immigrant advocacy groups and immigration enforcement advocates. In response, the Obama Administration, like earlier administrations, has modified and revised the program's policies and priorities.

Immigrant advocates contended the program frequently removed noncitizens who either had committed minor crimes or had no criminal records, and that many of those removed had established family and community ties in the United States, including U.S.-born children. After several years of modifying Secure Communities, the Obama Administration ultimately replaced it with a revised set of priorities under the Priority Enforcement Program.", "Similarly, the \u00a7287(g) program has raised concerns among immigrant advocacy groups about local law enforcement's involvement in immigration enforcement, specifically inconsistent policies, possible racial profiling, and possible damage to community policing through the conflation of immigration enforcement and general law enforcement. In response, the Administration tempered its \u00a7287(g) program by revising all Memoranda of Agreements to ensure greater consistency across jurisdictions.

History of Criminal Alien Removal Programs", "In 1986, with passage of the Immigration Reform and Control Act ( P.L. 99-603 ), Congress made deporting aliens who had been convicted of certain crimes a formal enforcement priority. The law required the Attorney General \"in the case of an alien who is convicted of an offense which makes the alien subject to deportation \u2026 [to] begin any deportation proceeding as expeditiously as possible after the date of the conviction.\"", "The former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) established a pair of programs in 1988 to comply with this requirement: the Institutional Removal Program (IRP) and the Alien Criminal Apprehension Program (ACAP). The programs forged partnerships with corrections facilities to identify deportable aliens convicted of crimes before their release from prison. They also worked with the Department of Justice's Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) to initiate deportation proceedings against aliens serving sentences for deportable offenses during their period of incarceration.", "The IRP and ACAP initially focused on aggravated felons, a class of serious criminal aliens created in immigration law by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 ( P.L. 100-690 ) and enumerated in \u00a7101(a)(43) of the INA. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act defined aggravated felonies to include aliens convicted of murder, drug trafficking, or illegal trafficking in firearms or destructive devices. ", "Between 1990 and 1996, Congress enacted a series of measures that expanded the definition of aggravated felons and created additional criminal grounds for removal. The mandates of the IRP and ACAP likewise expanded to include this broader list of offenses.", "In 1999, the INS issued an Interior Enforcement Strategy, which named as the agency's top interior enforcement priority the identification and removal of criminal aliens and the minimization of recidivism (i.e., illegal reentry by previously removed aliens). Accordingly, between 1998 and 2002 the INS devoted more resources to the removal of criminal aliens than to all other interior enforcement priorities combined. ", "In the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, the new Department of Homeland Security (DHS) focused its enforcement activities on suspected terrorists and homeland defense, but with the continued growth of the foreign-born population after 2000, programs targeting criminal aliens also remained an enforcement priority. Within DHS, the IRP and ACAP initially were managed jointly by Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Detention and Removal Operations (DRO) and its Office of Homeland Security Investigations. Between 2005 and 2007, the IRP and ACAP were combined into a single Criminal Alien Program (CAP) program within DRO. In 2010, DRO was renamed Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO).", "On November 20, 2014, the President issued his Immigration Accountability Executive Order that ended the Secure Communities program and replaced it with the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP).
