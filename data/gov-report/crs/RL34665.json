In early August 2009, the outgoing commander of the hybrid U.N.-AU peacekeeping mission in Darfur (UNAMID), General Martin Luther Agwai, reportedly stated that the decision to pursue Bashir had been a \"big blow\" for UNAMID and the peace process, although it had not had as drastic an effect on the ground as he had feared. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who has maintained a neutral position on the ICC's actions in Sudan, has nonetheless argued that the international community must seek to balance \"peace\" and \"justice\" in dealing with the conflict in Darfur and expressed concern that the expulsion of aid organizations was detrimental to relief and peacekeeping operations.", "Supporters of the Court maintain that the warrant against Bashir may open up new opportunities to secure peace in Darfur, as a credible threat of prosecution may serve as an important lever of pressure on actors in a conflict. For example, Priscilla Hayner of the International Center for Transitional Justice has written that \"it would be wrong to suggest that pragmatism always trumps principle in matters of life and death, and thus that one must ease up on justice in order to achieve peace. In some cases, the interest of peace has been well served by strong, forthright efforts to advance justice.\" Some argue that \"peace deals that sacrifice justice often fail to produce peace\" in the long run. Many observers point out that discerning the effect of ICC actions on complex processes is extremely difficult."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
