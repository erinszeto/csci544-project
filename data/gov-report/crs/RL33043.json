Some activities undertaken to meet theseregulatory obligations may have an auxiliary security benefit, either by lowering the consequencesof a chemical release or through reduction of a particular vulnerability. Also, federal securityregulations exist for some specific chemical, or chemical-related, facilities. In general, these securityregulations were developed to protect facilities against criminal activities, such as vandalism or theft,rather than terrorist attack. Examples of such security regulations include the protection of liquifiednatural gas storage facilities (49 CFR 193), hazardous liquids pipeline pumping stations (49 CFR195.436), and storage sites for hazardous materials shippers (49 CFR 172.800).

To prioritize outreach to the chemicalssector, DHS has divided, using DHS-determined metrics, the universe of RMP facilities into fourtiers. Only 272 facilities occupy the top two tiers.

The narrowness or breadth of this definition will likelyinfluence the practicability of security regulations and determine the degree of security riskreduction.", "This section discusses three possible mechanisms for selecting chemical facilities for securityregulation, based on a list of chemicals, the potential consequences of a terrorist attack, or anindustrial classification. Considering the breadth of U.S. chemical sites that could be attractivetargets for terrorists, it is likely that a comprehensive definition will require a combination ofapproaches.", "Defining by Chemical. Environmental and safetylegislation often list, or direct an agency to list, chemicals for regulation, and then require regulationof those facilities that contain them, usually at levels above certain threshold quantities. Examplesof such legislation include the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA),passed as part of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act ( P.L. 99-499 ), and the CleanAir Act Amendments of 1990 ( P.L. 101-549 ), which established both the Environmental ProtectionAgency (EPA) risk management program and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA) process safety management program.", "One challenge in using this approach may be determining which chemicals to include whenconsidering chemical facility security. Existing federal chemical lists are generally developed forother reasons, and therefore may not be appropriate for security purposes. For example, theDepartment of Transportation list for regulation of transport of hazardous materials contains severalthousand chemicals, not all of which are a security risk. (32) The OSHA process safety standard applies to a group of highlyhazardous chemicals selected because of their potential hazard to workers. (33) The EPCRA lists severalhundred chemicals in order to ensure the safety of first responders in the event of a chemicalaccident. (34) ", "The Clean Air Act, Section 112(r), requires a risk management plan (RMP) for facilitiespossessing more than threshold quantities of any of 140 chemicals. (35) These chemicals areincluded because of their potential for acute, offsite consequences to human health or theenvironment in the event of a sudden, large, accidental release. The risk management programrequires these facilities to estimate the population that might be affected under a worst-case scenariorelease, calculating the population that resides within a circle surrounding the facility, with the radiusof the circle determined by the distance the worst-case scenario release might travel. (36) While these estimates arenot intended to model a potential terrorist release, the potentially affected population in a worst-casescenario is often cited in discussing chemical facility security risks.", "Such hazardous chemical lists generally identify chemicals based on an inherent hazard, suchas toxicity or flammability. One potential drawback to defining facilities by referring to these listsis that they exclude potentially hazardous chemicals for reasons other than risk. For example, theRMP list, often referred to in discussions of chemical facility security, does not includeexplosives. (37) It alsoexempts material already regulated under 49 CFR 192, 193, and 195, such as liquified natural gas,which is covered by other safety regulations. (38) The list of RMP facilities was further reduced by statute toexclude facilities where flammables are stored on site as fuel or for retail distribution as fuel. (39) Congress may or may notwant to include such exempted materials when considering chemicals in a terrorism context.", "Of course, any of the above lists, or any other chemical list, might be edited to meet thesecurity need. To better focus federal resources, a much shorter list of chemicals might be desirable. Alternatively, an appropriate federal agency might develop a new chemical list specifically forsecurity purposes, avoiding a focus on previous lists. One safety expert testified that", "I would not want [the Department of] HomelandSecurity to think that somehow it can pull out of another agency the named list of chemicals and talkto the industry and say these are the only ones we're going to worry about. (40)", "Policymakers might require a federal agency, such as EPA or DHS, to develop and maintain sucha list. If Congress wants chemical facility security efforts to address particular chemical threats, itmight list specific chemicals in statute, while allowing the federal agency to modify the list. (41) ", "Defining by Consequence. Another potentialcriterion for determining which chemical facilities to address is the likelihood and severity of adverseconsequences in the case of a terrorist attack. Such consequences might include the possibility orprobability of injury, loss of life, financial harm, environmental damage, or loss of critical chemicalproduction. Experts disagree on how best to determine the likelihood and severity of theseconsequences, their relative importance, and whether these different consequences lend themselvesto comparison, should be considered independently, or can be appropriately ranked.", "Because federal resources are limited, prioritizing chemical facilities by risk may be aneffective approach to maximizing the benefits from security spending. DHS Secretary Chertoff,implying such an approach, stated, \"When you start to think about your priorities, you're going tothink about making sure you don't have a catastrophic thing first.\" (42) A risk-prioritizationapproach may allow the development of thresholds defining risk characteristics for chemicalfacilities, and thereby determine which chemical facilities should receive federal resources or requirefederal attention. The magnitude of the threshold used would likely determine several characteristicsof the chemical facility universe, including the inclusion or exclusion of different types of chemicalfacilities, the regional distribution of facilities, the degree of potential increased security, and theprogram cost. ", "An additional factor in defining by consequence involves the type of data that might be usedto determine a risk threshold. What metric is most appropriate and how should it be determined? For example, in considering human casualties, should one consider a worst-case scenario or a moreprobable release? The degree of complexity and accuracy required to model these scenarios mightbe an area of contention. For example, DHS uses a different methodology to determine potentiallyaffected people following a terrorism-related chemical release than EPA uses when assessingpotential risks from accidental releases. ", "The potentially affected residential population in the EPA RMP program's worst-casescenario is often cited in the debate about chemical facility security. These predictions are knownto be very conservative and are intended to be used for planning purposes by emergency responseorganizations and government agencies. Some analysts assert that these RMP figures are a viablestarting point for prioritizing chemical facility risk. (43) Other analysts assert that RMP figures overestimate the actualnumber of casualties. For example, DHS modeling of one specific facility showed that the numberof persons potentially affected was much lower than projected from regulatory calculations. (44) ", "Still others contend that the RMP figures may underestimate the casualties from a terroristattack, as the scenarios are modeled on a release from a single chemical process. Since manychemical processes may be located in a chemical facility, it is possible that a greater amount ofchemical might be released during an intentional attack than during an accidental release. (45) Determining the extentof likely casualties from a release might require extensive modeling of facility location,meteorological information, surrounding population distribution, and other factors, which may proveto be prohibitively difficult for a large number of chemical facilities.", "Defining by Industry Classification. Anotherapproach towards defining chemical facilities might be by industrial classification. Such anapproach appears to align with The National Strategy for Physical Protection of CriticalInfrastructure and Key Assets and Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7), wherecritical infrastructure is subdivided into specific infrastructure sectors and federal agencies areassigned lead roles for each sector. (46) Critical infrastructure sectors may be composed of similarindustries or of industries with common elements. For example, HSPD-7 identifies an \"energy\"sector and a \"chemical and hazardous materials\" sector. The latter sector is defined to includechemical manufacturers and processors. The range of facilities that policymakers may wish toinclude in chemical facility legislation may not align cleanly, however, with either a particularindustrial classification or with a single critical infrastructure sector. For example, users of largeamounts of chemicals, such as water or wastewater treatment facilities, may fall into a criticalinfrastructure sector other than \"chemical and hazardous materials.\"", "The Department of Labor uses the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS)to classify employment and economic data by industry. (47) NAICS codes are hierarchical; codes containing more digits aresubsets of codes containing fewer digits. For example, NAICS code 3251 (Basic ChemicalManufacturing) is a subset of NAICS code 325 (Chemical Manufacturing). The NAICS codes areoften self-assigned, in that a facility determines which NAICS code appropriately defines its businessactivity. Therefore, an approach relying on these codes might be susceptible to error due to incorrectself-assignment. On the other hand, federal agencies use such industry classification schemes toassess economic activity across industry groups, indicating that this self-classification scheme maybe acceptable. ", "Defining chemical facilities according to industry classification might lead to the \"one sizefits all\" approach to chemical facility security criticized by various industry groups. (48) Such an approach mayrequire facilities that are not a security risk to increase their security solely because of their industryclassification, rather than their actual risk. Such security efforts might not reduce the national riskand might be viewed as counterproductive, potentially impairing economic efficiency withoutincreasing security. Moreover, due to fiscal constraints, smaller facilities might be unable to meetrequirements designed for larger facilities, potentially damaging a company's ability to operate.

A potential difficulty offocusing on a particular industry sector, or of using industrial classification to define chemicalfacilities, derives from the diverse impacts that particular industries have on security.

In Figure 1 , CRS grouped NAICS industrycodes into infrastructure sectors used in HSPD-7. (See Appendix A for a description of howinfrastructure sectors were constructed from NAICS codes.)

On the other hand, as the threshold for inclusion in a chemical facilitysecurity framework is lowered, additional infrastructure sectors grow in relative representation, asis seen by the food and agriculture sectors in Figure 1 . Because of the increased representation ofthese industry sectors, chemical facility security regulations will likely need to be more flexible toaccount for different operating environments and business needs.

Under the MTSA, the DHS has the authority toinspect port facilities, assess their security plans and actions, and determine whether the facilitiesmeet DHS security standards. The EPA was not granted similar authorities under SDWA.", "Policymakers might decide to require that site vulnerability assessments be performed for allchemical facilities and supplied to the federal government or others. Verification and validation ofvoluntary security plans is a topic of continuing concern by advocacy groups, so policymakers mightprovide the federal oversight agency the authority to inspect and assess compliance with vulnerabilityassessments and any remediation requirements. However, in contrast to the limited number ofchemical facilities covered by MTSA, a broad legislative definition of chemical facilities couldinclude thousands of facilities. The logistical burden of inspecting these facilities on a recurringbasis could be quite high for a federal agency. Current agency staffing may be insufficient to meetthis requirement. Consequently, requiring federal auditing and validation of chemical facilitysecurity may be difficult to implement in a timely manner. Auditing responsibilities could bedelegated to state or local officials to reduce the burden placed on federal agencies.", "Alternatively, Congress could authorize agencies to license third-party auditors and acceptcompliance reports they might submit on behalf of chemical facilities. DHS Secretary Chertoff hasexpressed support for Congressional consideration of such third-party validation. (53) Fees from such a programcould offset auditing costs. If such auditing were done by third parties or was enforced by a differentmechanism, such as holding facility owners or operators liable for security measures at the chemicalfacilities, costs might be somewhat reduced. Critics of outside auditing question the impartiality andrigor of such reviews, citing breakdowns in analogous financial auditing approaches. (54) ", "Some experts suggest requiring owner or operator certification of security measurecompliance, with associated criminal liabilities for noncompliance. (55) Such an approach, coupledwith inspections, might provide incentives to businesses to maintain high security standards.", "Prescriptive Versus Performance-basedRequirements. The basis for chemical facility security requirements is another areaof contention. Chemical trade associations and others have testified that chemical facility securityrequirements should be risk-based and provide clear guidelines regarding federal expectations. (56) Also, they have requestedfederal assistance and access to federal records, for background checks and other purposes, as partof meeting security standards. (57) ", "DHS Secretary Chertoff has emphasized the need for risk-based prioritization in homelandsecurity activities. (58) The DHS testified that the federal government, in approaching chemical facility security, shouldadhere to three core principles:", "Chemical facilities present different levels of risk, and the most scrutiny shouldbe focused on those that have the greatest consequences.", "Chemical facility security should be based on reasonable, clear, and equitableperformance standards, developed by DHS. Chemical facilities should be able to select amongappropriate site specific security measures. ", "Chemical facility security efforts should recognize voluntary industryefforts. (59)", "Some analysts argue for strong performance standards, requiring chemical facilities to be ableto repel armed assault, as required of the nuclear power industry. (60) Others have cited the U.S.Coast Guard's implementation of the MTSA as a good model for performance-based requirements.", "Existing security regulation for some chemical storage facilities, such as liquified natural gas,is prescriptive in nature. Federal regulation governs security procedures, protective enclosures,communications, monitoring, lighting, power sources, and warning signs. (61) Some experts assert thatsuch prescriptive regulations lead to outdated security standards should threats or vulnerabilitieschange. Policymakers may consider whether security requirements should be prescriptive orperformance-based, and whether any such requirements should be placed directly in legislation, orwhether the implementing agency should be provided the discretion to determine securityrequirements. ", "Inherently Safer Technologies. The applicationof inherently safer technology to increase chemical facility security is also a subject of debate. Theconcept of inherently safer technology involves altering a chemical process by substituting lesshazardous materials, minimizing the amount of hazardous material on hand, altering the processconditions, or designing operation so that it is more tolerant of error. (62) Advocates of inherentlysafer technology state that its application would directly reduce security risks, because the hazardposing the security risk would be replaced or reduced. (63) While acknowledging that not all chemical processes haveinherently safer alternatives, advocates cite cases where inherently safer alternatives are known andcould be employed. (64) They claim that federal security legislation should require at least the consideration of thesetechnologies when addressing chemical facility vulnerabilities.", "Industry trade associations are generally resistant to legislation mandating the use of, orincorporating a requirement to consider, inherently safer technology. They state that decisionsregarding the use of inherently safer technology are weighed on a process and facility basis and areregularly considered by process engineers when optimizing and assessing process change. (65) Additionally, they cite thepotential to impact process safety negatively should inherently safer technology approaches beincorrectly implemented. For example, if stockpiles of a hazardous chemical are reduced, more,smaller shipments may be required. More connections would be required to transfer the sameamount of material from smaller shipments. This might lead to greater risk for workers making thesetransfers. Lastly, industry trade associations express concern that if inherently safer technologyimplementation decisions are not made by process safety experts, future difficulties and potentialimpracticalities may arise. (66) ", "Another consideration discussed in the context of inherently safer technologies is thepotential to transfer risk from one chemical facility to another chemical facility. (67) Process changes, such asthe conversion of wastewater treatment from chlorine as a disinfectant to sodium hypochlorite as adisinfectant, may lower the potential consequences at that facility, reducing the risk to thesurrounding area. Those process changes may, however, increase the risk at a different point in thesupply chain. For example, the facility converting chlorine into sodium hypochlorite may increaseits chlorine stocks to address a greater demand for the sodium hypochlorite end product, increasingthe potential consequences surrounding that manufacturing facility. Depending on the relativepopulation at each facility, fewer or more individuals may be put at risk by the facility processchange.", "Experts in process engineering have testified that research in inherently safer technology isstill nascent. While some practical examples of inherently safer technology have been developed,they assert that metrics for comparing one technology to another to determine its inherent safety arenot yet defined. (68) Assuch, they challenge whether new inherently safer technology will be developed for chemicalprocesses without an extensive research effort and question the feasibility of mandatingimplementation of inherently safer technology. (69) ", "Safety regulation requiring the consideration of inherently safer technology has beendeveloped on the state and local level. For example, New Jersey, in implementing the ToxicCatastrophe Prevention Act, requires the consideration of inherently safer technology for all newfacilities and processes covered under the act. (70) Mandatory chemical facility security standards recentlyimplemented in New Jersey now require chemical facilities regulated under the Toxic CatastrophePrevention Act to consider inherently safer technologies for existing processes. (71) In contrast to concernsvoiced by critics of inherently safer technology, the New Jersey Department of EnvironmentalProtection has found that such \"evaluation of inherently safer technology is not overly burdensomeon industry.\" (72) ContraCosta County, California, also requires the consideration of inherently safer technologies. (73) Policymakers, inconsidering inherently safer technologies, may wish to assess whether new processes or facilities arefundamentally different than existing processes or facilities, and might benefit from a securityrequirement to consider inherently safer technologies. (74) ", "Consequences of Noncompliance. If newchemical facility security requirements are established, penalties for not meeting these standardsmight need to be determined. Civil or criminal penalties, such as fines, might be assessed againstfacility owners or operators, whose security did not meet program standards. If a tiered system ofsecurity requirements were established, penalties might be tiered as well. Some might argue thoughthat the effect of tiering would be to lower penalties below what would be sufficient to ensurecompliance, while others might contend that penalties should be more directly related to the criteriadetermining the tiering.", "A different approach to enforcing compliance would be to enable the federal agencyimplementing the chemical facility security program to prevent operation of a facility if it is out ofcompliance with the program. The U.S. Coast Guard is granted this authority under MTSA. Suchlanguage could be developed for any new program. Stakeholder concerns regarding such anauthority would likely revolve around details of its use, such as the ability of a facility to appeal suchauthority. The authority to stop operation of a chemical facility due to insufficient security woulddirectly affect the fiscal viability of a facility, providing a strong incentive to maintain compliancewith security requirements.

The MTSA and SDWA,both of which cover some chemical facilities, mandate different regulatory agencies, securityrequirements, and authorities regarding noncompliance. The DHS, through the U.S. Coast Guard,implements the MTSA, while EPA implements the SDWA. The SDWA requires vulnerabilityassessment, but not remediation, while MTSA requires both vulnerability assessment andremediation. The MTSA grants the Coast Guard the ability to close facilities that lack appropriatesecurity, while the SDWA does not. Legislation affecting all chemical facilities could bridge theseregulations and attempt to reconcile their requirements. Chemical facility legislation might requirethe higher standard to be applied to all chemical facilities, thereby requiring those water facilities thatalso qualify as a chemical facility to increase their site security activities. Alternatively, it mightrequire all chemical facilities meet the SDWA standard, leaving MTSA-regulated facilities with ahigher security requirement. As a third option, new chemical facility security requirements mightexempt facilities regulated under the MTSA or SDWA.", "State and Local Regulation. States have passedchemical facility security legislation. Policymakers may wish to decide how existing and proposedfederal regulations might mesh with state requirements. While all states contain chemical facilities,depending on the facilities located in each state, the perception of likelihood and consequence of aterrorist attack may vary significantly. While some analysts assert that the potential consequencesof an attack on a chemical facility are such that it poses a homeland security threat, others may claimthat these facilities and the population surrounding them generally reside within the boundaries ofsingle state and would be best served by state, rather than federal, regulation.", "Should Congress determine that chemical facility security is a federal homeland securityconcern, policymakers may need to address whether federal regulation will preempt state regulation,or if it will form the base from which states may impose stricter security requirements.

An apparentconcern is that allowing individual states to add security requirements above a federal minimumwould lead to a patchwork of state regulation and, potentially, increased regulatory compliance costs.
