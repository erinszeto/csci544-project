The motion proposes only to return the bill to the committee that had reported it. When the House adopts a simple recommittal motion, the underlying bill goes back to committee and is considered to have been rejected by the House. The simple motion gives the House an indirect way to \"kill\" a bill instead of voting directly on its final passage.", "By contrast, a motion to recommit with instructions provides the minority a last chance to amend a bill. A recommittal motion in this form proposes to send the bill back to committee and also to instruct the committee as to what additional action on the bill it should take. Most often, these instructions direct the committee contain an additional amendment to the bill. Thus, the mover of a recommittal motion with instructions seeks not to \"kill\" the underlying bill, but to change it to conform more fully with his or her policy views. These policy views are generally those advocated by the minority party.", "Most recommittal motions with instructions order the committee to report the bill back to the House \"forthwith\" with an amendment. These \"amendatory instructions\" contain the text of the proposed amendment. In this form, a recommittal motion gives the committee no discretion and no time in which to act. The committee must return the bill to the House with the amendment immediately. Consequently, when the House adopts a recommittal motion with amendatory instructions , the underlying bill is not actually sent back to committee. Instead, the chairman of the committee specified in the motion takes the floor and, on behalf of the committee, immediately reports the measure back to the House with the amendment set forth in the instructions.", "At this point, the bill is before the House once again, and the amendment contained in the instructions is the pending question for the House to decide. So the House proceeds to vote on the amendment. If the amendment is adopted, the House then votes on whether to pass the bill as it now has been amended.

The chair explained that the instructions proposed adding language that would change immigration law, a subject that was not addressed in the underlying bill.", "Amendatory instructions also cannot propose to strike out an amendment that the House already has adopted; this is consistent with the principle that an amendment cannot be amended after having been adopted. By the same token, the instructions cannot propose to amend a portion of the bill that the House already has amended in its entirety; this reflects the principle that it is not in order to propose to amend only amended text. The amendment in a recommittal motion can, however, propose (and often has proposed) an amendment that was earlier rejected by the Committee of the Whole or the House.", "When the House adopts an amendment in the nature of a substitute reported by the Committee of the Whole (i.e., a completely new version of the bill), this action could preclude a recommittal motion from including amendatory instructions because any amendment would propose to reamend some portion of the bill that the House already has amended. For this reason, whenever a special rule anticipates that the House will consider an amendment in the nature of a substitute, the special rule almost always provides explicitly for a motion to recommit \"with or without instructions.\"", "If the House considers a bill under a special rule, amendatory instructions in the recommittal motion must conform with any other relevant provisions of that resolution. For example, if the special rule prohibits amendments to Title II of the bill in both the Committee of the Whole and the House, it would be out of order to move to recommit the bill with instructions to amend Title II. Amendatory instructions also must abide by certain rule-making provisions of law, such as certain provisions in the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 ( P.L. 93-344 , 88 Stat. 297-339, as amended).", "When the underlying measure is a general appropriations bill , a motion to recommit with amendatory instructions must comply with other applicable House rules.

Earlier, Representative Markey had offered this identical section as an amendment in the Committee of the Whole. The Committee of the Whole, however, adopted a substitute for the Markey amendment.

These precedents interpreted clause 6 of Rule XIII as allowing the Rules Committee to report a special rule that prevented or limited the inclusion of instructions in a motion to recommit a bill or joint resolution. Because there were no recorded votes in the Committee of the Whole until 1971, a recommittal motion with amendatory instructions provided the only certain means for the minority to obtain a recorded House vote on its policy alternative.

First, the House normally votes to order the previous question on the motion and the amendment that has been offered to it. After the previous question is ordered, the House first votes on the amendment.
