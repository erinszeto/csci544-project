Climate change responses have typically been categorized into two broad types: mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation measures attempt to slow down the occurrence of climate change by, for example, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Adaptation measures, on the other hand, aim to improve an individual or institution's ability to cope with or avoid harmful impacts of climate change, and to take advantage of potential beneficial ones. While much attention has been paid to mitigation efforts, a growing focus on current impacts of climate change has led to specific provisions in several bills that would increase research on and programmatic attention to possible options for adaptation. Climate change mitigation and adaptation activities are not mutually exclusive, and in most cases can actually be complementary. Because the extent of climate change impacts upon different ecosystems, regions, and sectors of the economy will depend not only on the sensitivity of those systems to climate change, but also on the systems' ability to adapt to climate change, both types of activities are considered by many to be an essential part of a comprehensive approach to dealing with the impacts of climate change.", "The American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 ( H.R. 2454 ) passed the House on June 26, 2009. The Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee approved the Clean Energy, Jobs, and Power Act ( S. 1733 ) on November 5, 2009. Both H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 would establish a cap-and-trade system to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, and address energy topics including energy efficiency and renewable energy.

The report also found that population growth and increased use of resources will limit the ability of society and natural systems to adapt successfully. Specific findings include increased:", "stress on water resources, which will amplify regional droughts and reduce water supply, especially in regions dependent on western mountain snowpack; risk for coastal settlements, infrastructure, and ecosystems from sea-level rise and more intense hurricanes and storm surges; numbers of wildfires and areas of forest adversely affected or destroyed by pest outbreaks linked to warming; threats to human health related to heat waves, poor air quality, and insect-borne diseases; challenges to crop and livestock production due to increasing stress on water resources, increasing temperatures, increasing outbreaks of pests and diseases, and the need for new management practices; stress of population growth and overuse of resources, which will limit the ability of society and natural systems to adapt successfully.", "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) stated in its Fourth Assessment Report that \"adaptation will be necessary to address impacts resulting from the warming which is already unavoidable due to past emissions.\" The panel concluded that many industrial sectors and the natural environment, including agriculture, forestry, water resources, human health, coastal settlements, and natural ecosystems, will need to adapt to a changing climate or possibly face diminished productivity, functioning, and health. ", "Adaptation can include a wide range of activities. For agriculture, examples of adaptation can include farmers changing management practices\u2014for example, altering their planting dates and irrigation scheduling\u2014or farmers switching to different crop varieties altogether, in response to changing temperature and rainfall regimes. For coastal regions, strategies to prevent damage from climate change and rising sea levels can include improving shoreline protection measures\u2014for example, installing dikes, levies, other structures, and beach vegetation\u2014or can result in companies relocating key business centers away from coastal areas vulnerable to inundation and hurricanes.

According to a recent report by the National Research Council (NRC), individuals and institutions are unprepared both conceptually and practically for meeting the challenges and opportunities that climate change presents. Similarly, at a recent hearing of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, experts testified that current U.S. adaptation efforts are largely ad hoc, uncoordinated, underfunded, and lacking the information needed to make critical decisions. Specifically, testimony from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), based on its recently released report on nationwide climate change adaptation efforts, concluded that adaptation efforts are often constrained by a lack of site-specific data, such as local projections of expected changes, and by a lack of clear roles and responsibilities among federal, state, and local agencies. The NRC report included recommendations to bolster the capacity of federal programs in the area of climate science and information; to strengthen research on adaptation, mitigation, and vulnerability; to initiate a periodic national assessment of climate impacts and responses; and to routinely provide policymakers and the public with the relevant scientific information, tools, and forecasts to make better-informed decisions. ", "Adaptation initiatives are starting to gain traction at the federal and state levels. For instance, the Department of Interior (DOI) recently launched an internal agency initiative to develop a coordinated strategy to address current and future impacts of climate change. The DOI initiative, which was established through secretarial order, establishes a framework through which Interior bureaus will coordinate climate change science and resource management strategies. Also, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments has a program that supports research to meet the adaptation-related information needs of local decision-makers. While federal agencies are beginning to recognize the need to adapt to climate change, there is still a general lack of strategic coordination across agencies, and most efforts to adapt to potential climate change impacts are preliminary. ", "Some states have begun to make progress on adaptation independently and through partnerships with other entities, such as academic institutions. The state of California recently developed and released a draft California Climate Adaptation Strategy. This is the first example of a strategic, operational plan for collaborative action by state agencies to adapt to impacts of global climate disruption and sea-level rise. Maryland has also begun a strategic planning process to better understand the impacts of climate change on the state's economy and natural resources, especially the Chesapeake Bay region, and to coordinate state efforts. ", "In devising these strategic plans for adaptation, states are often calling for more resources, leadership, and coordination from the federal government.

", "One significant difference between the two pieces of legislation is the distribution of allowances and proceeds from auction allocations and the subsequent availability of the amounts credited to certain funds. In the Senate bill, several of the adaptation-related provisions provide that the amounts in the funds are automatically available to be obligated (i.e., spent), \"without further appropriation,\" for specified purposes, programs, and activities. In contrast, the analogous adaptation provisions in the House bill provide that the amounts in the funds would become available only by subsequent appropriations. That is, the amounts would not be available automatically, but instead would need to be provided in subsequent appropriations acts.", "H.R. 2454 both allocates allowances directly and creates several funds for the allocation of proceeds from the sale of allowances. It generally allocates allowances to states and tribes, and proceeds from the auction of allowances to federal government agencies. Authorizations are subject to future appropriations. For the adaptation provisions, the House relies on hortatory language, such as that found in Section 480(b), to support full appropriations for certain natural resources programs: \"... such sums as are deposited in the Natural Resources Climate Change Fund, and the amounts appropriated for subsection (c) shall be no less than the total estimated annual deposits in the Natural Resources Climate Change Adaptation Fund.\"", "While the allocations of allowances and of the proceeds from auctions are distributed similarly by S. 1733 , in the Senate bill, in all cases related to adaptation, the auction proceeds for programs or funds would be automatically available to be obligated (i.e., spent) \"without further appropriation.\" The provision of funding \"without further appropriation\" might be controversial. Comparable language in provisions of the House bill (none related to adaptation programs, however) has been scored by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) as mandatory spending.

A variety of international institutions and nongovernmental organizations have tried to estimate the costs of adaptation for developing countries and the associated needs for public funding. Figures range from $4 billion to several hundreds of billions of dollars annually by the year 2030, where definitions and scope of adaptation activities often account for many of the differences in funding requirements. The World Bank, in an updated study from September 2009, estimates the average annual adaptation costs from 2010 to 2050 to be between $75 billion to $100 billion annually, while EU leaders agreed in October 2009 that developing nations would need $150 billion annually by 2020 to tackle climate change and to deal with its consequences.

To assist adaptation by water utilities, S. 1733 (in Division A) would establish a research program to assist drinking water utilities (Section 211) and a program of grants to states and Indian tribes for water system adaptation projects (Section 381). S. 1733 would also include two other water-specific adaptation provisions\u2014Section 382, which would establish a grants program to states and Indian tribes for adapting to climate-related flood impacts, and Section 384, which would provide assistance to coastal (including Great Lakes) states for adapting to climate change. No specific provisions were included for drought or for adaptation of agricultural or energy sector water use to changed water resource availability and quality. Sections 381, 382, and 384 would be funded through the state climate change response account (Section 210 of Division B); Section 211 of Division A includes only an authorization of appropriations. These provisions focus to a greater extent on adapting to water quantity challenges of climate change (e.g., ensuring utilities' reliable delivery of water supply) than water quality (e.g., changes in dissolved oxygen levels or water chemistry resulting from warmer temperatures).", "Water-related adaptation planning and measures also are covered under broader provisions, most notably federal assistance for state adaptation efforts, federal research and assessment, and natural resources adaptation efforts by designated federal agencies. The bills would provide funding for select federal agencies to undertake aquatic ecosystem restoration activities and other water-related natural resource adaptation actions using allocations established for natural resources adaptation; otherwise, they do not specifically allocate funding for federal agencies to undertake climate change adaptation for water infrastructure (e.g., dams, levees, navigation improvements) or other water-related programs under their jurisdiction. The bills would direct federal water resource agencies, including the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers, to adapt their plans, programs, and activities. Because most water resource projects typically receive project-specific authorization from Congress, it is unclear how much authority and funding these agencies would have to implement adaptation actions. ", "S. 1733 and H.R. 2454 largely focus their federal natural resources adaptation provisions on the agencies responsible for managing and protecting water resources, such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, not the agencies working with the users that depend on water resources. For example, neither U.S. Department of Agriculture agencies (e.g., Natural Resources Conservation Service) nor Department of Energy entities (e.g., power marketing administrations) are included. Agriculture, particularly in the West, is the largest consumer of water. The energy sector also withdraws significant quantities during extraction, processing, and generation. Water-related independent entities, like the Tennessee Valley Authority, also are not specifically addressed in the natural resources adaptation provisions. One exception is that S. 1733 would include the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the natural resources adaptation panel proposed in the bill (Section 365). FEMA manages flood hazard mitigation programs and the national flood insurance program; FEMA is not included in a similar provision of H.R. 2454 (Section 475).", "In summary, the water-specific provisions of S. 1733 , which have no comparable provisions in H.R. 2454 , would be focused largely on issues arising from water quantity changes (e.g., reduced municipal water supplies, increased flooding, higher sea levels). While broad natural resource provisions of the bills include water resource agencies and funding for aquatic ecosystem restoration, less attention is given in S. 1733 or H.R. 2454 to the adaptation of federal water resources infrastructure to changes in water resource quantity and quality; similarly, while S. 1733 would address some of the adaptation challenges faced by municipal water providers, little attention is given in either bill to managing adaptation in two of the largest water use sectors\u2014agriculture and energy."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
