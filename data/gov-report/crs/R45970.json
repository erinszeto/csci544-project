Nor does the FBI report the total number of state and local firearms transfer or license denials.

According to the FBI, these POC-conducted background checks corresponded with 123.3 million NICS transactions. About 54.9% of these state transactions involved background checks related to firearms permits/licenses, an unreported percentage of which were for concealed carry permits. It is also noteworthy that some state-issued concealed-carry permits exempt the holder from any further background checks for non-NFA firearms. Hence, state and local NICS transactions also serve as an imperfect proxy for firearms sales. See Appendix C for a list of state permits that have been certified by ATF as Brady exempt. ", "From 2006 through 2018, total NICS transactions more than doubled from 10 million to 26 million or more, peaking in 2016 at 27.5 million and then dropping to 25.2 million in 2017, and rising again to 26.2 million in 2018. For the same years, total NICS transactions/checks handled entirely by the FBI NICS Section increased from 5.3 million to 9.4 million from 2006 to 2016, then dropped to 8.6 million in 2017, and dropped again to 8.2 million in 2018. In addition, NICS transactions handled by state and local agencies increased from 4.8 million to 18.2 million from 2006 to 2016, then dropped to 16.6 million in 2017, but rose again to 17.9 million in 2018. ", "In Figure 2 POC transactions account for an increasing proportion of all NICS transactions, but as discussed above some POC background checks involve more than one NICS transaction, whereas each NICS Section transaction corresponds with a single background check. As shown in Figure 3 , for the years 1999 through 2015, the FBI CJIS Division's NICS Section conducted as many or more background checks than state or local POC agencies.

In July 2004, DOJ issued a regulation that established the NICS Voluntary Appeal File (VAF), which is part of the NICS Indices (described above). DOJ was prompted to establish the VAF to minimize the inconvenience incurred by some prospective firearms transferees (purchasers) who have names or birth dates similar to those of prohibited persons. So as not to be misidentified in the future, these persons agree to authorize the FBI to maintain personally identifying information about them in the VAF as a means to avoid future delayed transfers.

During this time period, NCHIP grants were made available to states for purposes other than just identifying persons ineligible to receive firearms, such as identifying persons ineligible to hold positions involving vulnerable populations (e.g., children, disabled, and elderly).

Although H.R. 8 would provide exceptions for \"temporary transfers\" for target shooting and other related activities, some gun rights advocates argue that such exceptions are too narrow. For example, they argue further that H.R. 8 would prohibit a person from loaning a neighbor a firearm for a hunting trip with a background check being required for both the loan to the neighbor and the return of the firearm to its lawful owner. Perhaps more fundamentally, H.R. 8 would prohibit a person from loaning a firearm to another person\u00e2\u0080\u0094who may be facing some threat of death or serious bodily injury\u00e2\u0080\u0094for self-defense purposes, unless that threat were \"imminent.\" ", "Gun rights advocates might also see such a measure as a significant step towards a national\u00e2\u0080\u0094albeit decentralized\u00e2\u0080\u0094registry of firearms and firearms owners, since its practical implementation would likely necessitate recordkeeping on such transfers.

The NICS examiner reportedly focused on Lexington County and missed the fact that the City of Columbia, SC, Police Department was listed as the contact for Richland County, the county in which most of the City of Columbia, SC, is located. Consequently, the NICS examiner did not contact the Columbia, SC, Police Department, the agency that actually held the arrest record for the assailant. ", "If the FBI had ascertained during the 88 days that this person was prohibited, the NICS examiner would have likely contacted the FFL to verify whether a firearms transfer had been made after the three-business-day delay, and then would have notified the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) and a firearms retrieval action would have possibly been taken by that agency. In this case, the FBI did not ascertain that the assailant was possibly a prohibited person until after the June 17, 2015, mass shooting. Some gun control advocates have characterized these circumstances as the \"Charleston loophole.\" ", "In addition to the \"Charleston loophole,\" gun control advocates sometimes refer to \"delayed proceeds\" that could result in a possibly prohibited person acquiring a firearm after three business days have expired as \"default proceeds.\" They argue that extending the delayed proceed period would reduce the chance that an otherwise prohibited person might inadvertently be transferred a firearm, a circumstance that would likely necessitate an ATF firearms retrieval action had more time been allotted to complete the background check. ", "According to data acquired by a gun control advocacy group, about 3.59% of FBI-administered background checks in 2017 were unresolved after a delayed proceed response and the three-business-day window had passed. To this advocacy group, this suggested that a relatively small number of people (310,232) would be affected, and any inconvenience to them would be outweighed by increasing the probability that a prohibited person might be prevented from acquiring a firearm. ", "According to the FBI, it referred 6,004 \"delayed denial\" cases to the ATF in 2017 that could have possibly resulted in a finding of ineligibility and subsequent firearms retrieval action. In addition, the FBI reported that 4,864 of those cases involved individuals who were possibly prohibited and had probably acquired a firearm.", "Gun rights advocates would counter that a large percentage (98.1%) of background checks that resulted in a delayed proceed response involved persons who were not actually ineligible, prompting them to refer to such default proceed responses as \"default infringements.\" They maintain that the \"delayed proceeds\" should be viewed as an indicator of understaffing and incomplete recordkeeping on prohibited persons. Gun rights advocates underscore further that if the overall timeliness and accuracy of FBI background checks were improved, the process would be less likely to inconvenience an otherwise eligible person and, at the same time, less likely to allow a firearm to be transferred to a prohibited person. ", "According to the GAO, ATF processed 3,933 delayed denials in FY2017. Of those denials, 38 cases were referred to U.S. Attorney's Offices for prosecution.

Expanding the grounds for firearms transfer or receipt and possession ineligibility is one avenue along which intimate partner gun violence could be addressed, perhaps effectively, but such an expansion could also strain ongoing federal-state efforts to ensure that prohibiting records under current law are accurate and reported to NICS in a timely manner in order to be accessible electronically during background checks.", "Appendix A.

For 2018, by comparison, a smaller percentage (45.1%) were based on a felony conviction. This percentage decrease can be attributed to at least two factors. One, over time, persons with past felony convictions could be less likely to risk a background check through NICS. Two, since the establishment of NICS, state and local government submissions of prohibiting records\u00e2\u0080\u0094particularly those related to mental incompentency\u00e2\u0080\u0094have increased.
