Unlike the definitions of disability in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the IDEA definition is categorical, not functional, and contains a requirement that the child need special education and related services. The IDEA definition states the following:", "CHILD WITH A DISABILITY.\u2014(A) IN GENERAL.\u2014The term 'child with a disability' means a child\u2014(i) with mental retardation, hearing impairments (including deafness), speech or language impairments, visual impairments (including blindness), serious emotional disturbance (referred to in this title as 'emotional disturbance'), orthopedic impairments, autism, traumatic brain injury, other health impairments, or specific learning disabilities; and (ii) who, by reason thereof, needs special education and related services.", "The regulations elaborate on the \"other health impairments\" category and include examples of chronic or acute health impairments, such as asthma, attention deficit disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Tourette syndrome. ", "Judicial decisions involving IDEA's definition of a child with a disability have most often involved the requirement that the child must be in need of special education. For example, in L.I. v. Maine School Administrative District No. 55, the First Circuit Court of Appeals found that a child with Asperger's Syndrome and an adjustment disorder with depressed mood was a child with a disability under IDEA even though she had high grades, generally non-disruptive behavior, and \"undisputed intellectual ability.\" The court rejected the argument that IDEA is limited to children whose disabilities \"significantly impact educational performance,\" noting that neither the statute nor its regulations contain this limiting language."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Highly Qualified Teacher", "paragraphs": ["The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA, P.L. 108-446 , included a new definition of highly qualified teacher. The definition is linked to the definition of \"highly qualified\" in Section 9101(23) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) but modifies that definition as it applies to special education teachers. IDEA requires that every special education teacher, regardless of whether he or she is teaching a \"core academic subject,\" be highly qualified.

Although this requirement has not been heavily litigated, the Ninth Circuit held in Compton Unified School District v.

Rowley , decided in 1982, was the first IDEA case to reach the Supreme Court and remains a seminal decision on the requirements of FAPE. The Supreme Court noted that there was no substantive language in IDEA regarding the level of education to be accorded to children with disabilities and observed that \"(i)mplicit in the congressional purpose of providing access to a 'free appropriate public education' is the requirement that the education to which access is provided be sufficient to confer some educational benefit upon the handicapped child.\" The Court concluded that \"the 'basic floor of opportunity' provided by the Act consists of access to specialized instruction and related services which are individually designed to provide educational benefit to the handicapped child.\" The Court held that the requirement of FAPE is met when a child is provided with personalized instruction with sufficient support services to benefit educationally from that instruction. This instruction must be provided at public expense, meet the state's educational standards, must approximate the grade levels used in the state's regular education, and must comport with the child's IEP. The Court found that when a child with a disability is mainstreamed, \"the system itself monitors the educational progress of the child.... The grading and advancement system thus constitutes an important factor in determining educational benefit.\" Therefore, the IEP \"should be formulated in accordance with the requirements of the Act and, if the child is being educated in the regular classrooms of the public education system, should be reasonably calculated to enable the child to achieve passing marks and advance from grade to grade.\" However, the states are not required to \"maximize\" each child's potential. If the child is progressing from grade to grade and making measurable and adequate gains, the FAPE requirement is met.", "The Supreme Court also stated that in ensuring that the requirements of the statute have been met, courts must be careful to avoid imposing their view of preferable educational methods upon the states. The primary responsibility for formulating the education provided was left by IDEA to state and local educational agencies. As the Court noted, determining when children with disabilities are \"receiving sufficient educational benefits to satisfy the requirements of the Act presents a more difficult problem\" than complying with requirements for access to education. Because of the wide spectrum of disabilities, the Court did not attempt to establish any one test for determining the adequacy of educational benefits and confined its analysis to the facts of the case.", "Rowley remains a key decision under IDEA and is often cited by courts attempting to determine the parameters of a free appropriate public education. However, the lower courts have varied in how expansively they have interpreted Rowley , with some courts interpreting Rowley to support schools' IEPs if the procedural requirements have been met, even if the educational progress is minimal. Other courts have read Rowley more expansively. For example, in Polk v. Cent. Susquehanna Intermediate Unit 16 , the Third Circuit Court of Appeals examined the \"some educational benefit\" language in Rowley and held that it required an IEP to provide more than de minimis educational benefit.

", "Since the IEP is the way FAPE is implemented, it is a key component of IDEA and has been the subject of numerous judicial decisions. Generally, these cases have adopted a two-part inquiry: first, the court determines whether IDEA's procedures have been complied with; second, the court ascertains whether the IEP is reasonably calculated to provide the child with educational benefits.

In Irving Independent School District v. Tatro , the Court examined the case of an eight-year-old girl with spina bifida who required clean intermittent catheterization (CIC), and held that the school must provide the service. The Court ruled that services affecting both the medical and educational needs of a child must be provided under IDEA if (1) the child has a disability so as to require special education, (2) the service is necessary to help a child with a disability benefit from special education, and (3) a nurse or other qualified person who is not a physician can provide the service. Services that could be provided outside the school day would not need to be provided. Tatro drew a bright line between services that had to be provided by a doctor and those that could be provided by a person who was not a physician. However, after Tatro , some courts of appeals did not apply this bright line but used other factors, such as the nature and extent of services. This set the stage for another Supreme Court decision in 1999, Cedar Rapids Community School District v. Garret F .", "Garret F. involved a child who was paralyzed from the neck down as a result of a motorcycle accident when he was four years old. Since the child was ventilator dependent, he required substantial services including providing suction on his tracheotomy tube and manually pumping air through an air bag when suction is being provided. The school denied the parents' request for services and proposed a test for related services in which the outcome would depend on a series of factors, such as whether the care was continuous and the cost of the services. The Court rejected this proposed test and used the same reasoning it had used in Tatro, finding that the medical services exclusion from the definition was limited to the services of a physician or a hospital. This holding, the Court stated, was in keeping with the overarching purpose of IDEA \"to open the door of public education to all qualified children.\"", "The 2004 reauthorization dealt with this issue by establishing risk pools for high-need children with disabilities. States are permitted to reserve 10% of the funds reserved for other state activities (or 1% to 1.05% of the overall state grant) to establish and maintain a risk pool to assist local educational agencies (LEAs) serving high-need children with disabilities.

State Board of Education , to determine whether an IEP places a student in the least restrictive environment. First, a court must consider whether education in the regular classroom with the use of supplementary services can be achieved satisfactorily. Second, if such placement cannot be achieved satisfactorily, the court must consider whether the school has mainstreamed the child to the maximum extent appropriate. The first prong includes several factors: whether the school district has made reasonable efforts to accommodate the child in the regular classroom, the educational benefits available to the child in the regular classroom as compared to those in a special education classroom, and the possible negative effects of the inclusion of the child on other students in the regular classroom. ", "The possible negative effects of a child with a disability on other students were examined by the Third Circuit in A.G. v. Durta n. The court noted the student's frequent, loud vocalizations, combined with removal of shoes and socks, inappropriately clapping and grinding her teeth, having difficulty toileting, and inappropriately touching other students. Although these disruptions were not considered dispositive, the court considered them and upheld the district court decision that the student could not be satisfactorily educated full time in a regular classroom."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Private Schools", "paragraphs": ["Issues concerning what services are required for children with disabilities placed in private schools, and who is to pay for these services, have been a continuing source of controversy under IDEA.

In this situation, the full cost is paid for by the LEA or the SEA. A child with a disability may also be unilaterally placed in a private school by his or her parents. In this situation, the cost of the private school placement is not paid by the LEA unless a hearing officer or a court makes certain findings.

Tom F. , the Court, dividing 4-4, upheld an appeals court ruling that parents of a child with a disability are entitled to private school reimbursement even though the student had never received special education services from the school district. The Court's per curiam decision did not set a precedent for lower courts; therefore, the issue about whether reimbursement for private school tuition may be made when the child has not received public special education services was not settled until the Court's most recent decision in Forest Grove .", "In Forest Grove School District v. T.A. , the Supreme Court held that IDEA authorizes reimbursement for private special education services when a public school fails to provide FAPE and the private school placement is appropriate, regardless of whether the child previously received special education services through the public school. The Court emphasized that \"[i]t would be particularly strange for the Act to provide a remedy ... when a school district offers a child inadequate ...
