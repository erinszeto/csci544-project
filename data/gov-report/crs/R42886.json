Its mandate is to provide greater access for all Americans to telecommunications services, support U.S. efforts to open foreign markets, advise on international telecommunications negotiations, and fund research for new technologies and their applications. NTIA also manages the distribution of funds for several key grant programs. Its role in managing radio frequency spectrum allocated for federal use includes addressing policies for sharing, and monitoring and resolving questions regarding usage, including causes of interference. It is responsible for identifying federal spectrum that can be transferred to commercial use through the auction of spectrum licenses, conducted by the Federal Communications Commission. Many of the NTIA's responsibilities are shared with other agencies.", "With the passage of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-96), in February 2012, Congress has given the NTIA new responsibilities in spectrum management and the support of public safety initiatives. The 113th Congress may wish to review the NTIA's performance in meeting its obligations under the act.

The NTIA frequently works with other executive branch agencies to develop and present the Administration's position on key policy matters. It represents the executive branch in both domestic and international telecommunications and information policy activities. Policy areas in which the NTIA acts as the representative of the Administration include international negotiations regarding global agreements on the Internet and spectrum management, and domestic use of spectrum resources by federal agencies. In recent years, one of the responsibilities of the NTIA has been to oversee the transfer of some radio frequencies from the federal domain to the commercial domain. Many of these frequencies have subsequently been auctioned to the commercial sector and the proceeds paid into the U.S. Treasury. ", "In 2013, the NTIA focused on \"supporting the innovation economy of the future\u2014one that produces new and better jobs and positions the United States to remain competitive in the 21 st century.\" Notable programs to contribute this goal included promoting the deployment of broadband infrastructure, advocating a multi-stakeholder approach to Internet policymaking, and supporting the push to make more spectrum available for wireless technologies. ", "As part of President Obama's Wireless Initiative, the NTIA is charged with identifying electromagnetic spectrum that might be transferred from the federal sector to commercial wireless use. This spectrum might be auctioned as licenses for exclusive commercial use, made available for sharing between federal and commercial users, or repurposed in some other way that meets the stated goal of the Wireless Initiative to add 500 MHz of spectrum for wireless broadband. Congress also has required the NTIA to take actions to release spectrum from federal to commercial use and to ensure the efficient use of federal spectrum. ", "The NTIA administers some grants programs created by Congress, including the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP). BTOP grant programs are in the final stages of completion. As required by the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 ( P.L. 112-96 ), the NTIA is commencing a $135 million grant program to help states plan for participation in a new, nationwide public safety broadband network. To deploy the new network, the act established the First Responder Network Authority, or FirstNet, as an independent authority within the NTIA and assigned to the agency various responsibilities to support FirstNet. FirstNet is funded through the Public Safety Trust Fund, established by Congress to receive revenues from auctions of certain spectrum licenses. FirstNet has access to an advance of nearly $2 billion from the U.S. Treasury against expected proceeds of sales of spectrum licenses.

In FY2011, the total enacted budget appropriations amount for the NTIA increased by 4% to $41.6 million; funding for the PTFP was transferred to administrative expenses and salaries. According to the NTIA, the initial increase of $21.6 million from FY2010 to FY2011 in funding for salaries and expenses was largely attributable to the costs of administration of a $4.7 billion program for broadband deployment, as required by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-5 ). In FY2012 requests for funding to administer grant programs totaled $32.3 million, 70% of the fiscal year budget request. For FY2013, $25.8 million in funding was designated to administer the remaining broadband grant programs, primarily BTOP. The FY2014 request for broadband grant program oversight was for $24.7 million, roughly 40% of the total budget request.

Based on this assessment, the report included recommendations for seeking ways for federal and commercial users to share many of the frequencies, although some frequencies were identified to be cleared for auction to the private sector. At a hearing of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, the GAO provided testimony regarding its preliminary findings on spectrum sharing and followed up with a report. Both the hearing and the report indicated that spectrum sharing technology and policies were largely undeveloped. Some of the options to encourage sharing spectrum, as identified by the GAO, include considering spectrum usage fees to provide economic incentive for more efficient use and sharing; identifying more spectrum that could be made available for unlicensed use; encouraging research and development of technologies that can better enable sharing; and improving and expediting regulatory processes related to sharing.

", "In a letter to the FCC in July 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) offered to release frequencies between 1755-1780 MHz, based on sharing spectrum throughout the band in order to control the cost of relocation. DOD would retain access to the 1780-1850 MHz band and the 2025-2110 MHz band for relocation purposes. DOD estimated that relocation of its users in the 1755-1850 MHz to clear spectrum would cost $12 billion if the bands were fully cleared. If frequencies in the 1755-1850 MHz band were shared, relocation costs would be $3.5 billion, according to DOD.
