DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff announced a \"Second Stage Review\" (2SR) in 2005 that includes strengthening border security and interior enforcement and reforming immigration processes as major agenda items. Currently, three agencies in DHS have important immigration functions: Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).", "The immigration functions are dispersed across three agencies within DHS. The Assistant Secretary of ICE, the Commissioner of CBP, and the Director of USCIS all serve with the same rank directly under the DHS Secretary. Of these, only the Director of USCIS has responsibilities that are exclusively immigration. While the DHS Secretary is the lead cabinet officer on immigration issues, he shares substantial immigration policymaking roles with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State.", "Some now argue the disaggregation of the government's immigration responsibilities across several agencies has weakened immigration as a policy priority and has made it much more difficult for the executive branch to develop a comprehensive immigration reform and border security strategy. Others maintain that the current organizational structure sharpens the focus on the key, yet disparate, immigration functions and is optimal from a homeland security perspective.", "In seven of the eight workload measures analyzed over the past decade in this report, the immigration workload has declined in recent years.

Over the years, Congress has considered all three elements to address perceived, as well as reported, problems in immigration policy.", "This report focuses on the management and administration element.

In 1903, Congress transferred the various existing immigration functions from the Department of Treasury to the then-Department of Commerce and Labor. By 1905, this agency was known as the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization.", "When the Department of Labor (DOL) was established in 1913, the immigration and naturalization functions were transferred and split into the Bureau of Immigration and the Bureau of Naturalization, both in the new DOL. The two bureaus again merged into the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in 1933. These immigration and naturalization functions remained in DOL until 1940, when most were moved to the Department of Justice (DOJ), largely for national security reasons. In 1952, Congress consolidated and codified the body of immigration and citizenship laws and policies into the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).", "The last legislative reorganization of federal immigration functions was in 2002. Currently, five federal departments have important immigration responsibilities, with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as the lead.

During this period, the GAO published several reports that found problems in the administration of adjudications, the enforcement of immigration laws, and the management of case records overall. The Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy (SCIRP), which Congress established in 1978, offered a comprehensive package of recommendations in 1981 that included options aimed at strengthening and streamlining INS. SCIRP referred to INS as \"beleaguered\" and specifically recommended that INS be elevated as an agency within DOJ, with the Commissioner upgraded to a Director reporting directly to the Attorney General.", "The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) strengthened and broadened immigration enforcement (e.g., authorized legal sanctions against employers who hire unauthorized aliens) and legalized the status of several million unauthorized aliens living in the United States. Although this major overhaul of immigration law featured many of the recommendations of SCIRP, it did not address the organizational issues raised by SCIRP. Indeed, some observers have subsequently concluded that IRCA exacerbated the management problems of INS by overloading it with competing mandates, which included the legalization of 2.7 million unauthorized aliens, additional border controls, and the expansion of work site enforcement and employer sanctions.", "When the Commission for the Study of International Migration and Cooperative Economic Development (IRCA Commission), which Congress established in IRCA, issued its final report in 1990, it called for the creation of an Agency for Migration Affairs that reported directly to the President. The IRCA Commission recommended placing all immigration, naturalization, and refugee functions from the INS (except the law enforcement functions of the Border Patrol and interior enforcement agents) and from the Department of State into this independent agency. The IRCA Commission argued that consolidating and elevating these functions would address the problems brought on by inadequate prioritization and fragmentation across departments.", "By the close of the 20 th century, there was widespread concern with INS management that primarily centered on the competing priorities of adjudicating immigration benefits (service) and enforcing violations of immigration law (enforcement). In September 1997, the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform became yet another congressionally mandated study group to point out the administrative and management problems that plagued the implementation of immigration policy. It described INS as an agency suffering from conflicting priorities and mission overload, whose enforcement and service missions were incompatible. The U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform opted not to echo the past commissions' proposals to elevate the federal immigration system; rather, it recommended that the federal immigration system be fundamentally reorganized by, among other things, dismantling INS.", "GAO focused on specific problems with INS, most notably for having antiquated databases, failing to integrate its systems, and continuing the use of paper for tracking most of its data functions. The GAO reports were critical of the INS's field and regional offices due to an absence of communication among the various offices. The DOJ Office of Inspector General also questioned the reliability of INS's information systems and the accuracy of the information.", "The last two Commissioners of INS, Doris Meisner (1993-2000) and James Ziglar (2001-2003) each proposed to restructure INS administratively into distinct enforcement and service branches. Ziglar's restructuring was in progress as Congress weighed legislative action, which was further fueled by the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Prior to these attacks, several pieces of legislation were before the 107 th Congress that would have abolished INS and would have either created two separate bureaus within DOJ to carry out INS's current services and enforcement functions, created a integrated immigration agency within DOJ, or dispersed INS's service functions among a number of different agencies and created a new enforcement agency within DOJ."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Debate Over Immigration in the Homeland Security Act (HSA)18", "paragraphs": ["When the 107 th Congress weighed the broader question of homeland security and the creation of the DHS, the issue of where to locate the various immigration and citizenship functions then performed by the Department of Justice's INS and the Department of State's (DOS) Bureau of Consular Affairs became a major concern. The debate in the 107 th Congress centered on several options:", "place all of INS in a newly created DHS under a Border Security and Transportation Division (Bush Administration); place INS's enforcement functions in DHS under the Border Security and Transportation Division, but leave INS's service function in DOJ under a newly created Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (House-passed H.R. 5005 ); place all of INS in DHS in its own Directorate of Immigration Affairs, which would have two separate bureaus for the enforcement and service functions, with border inspections as a stand-alone and dual-function entity within the Directorate of Immigration Affairs (Senate substitute); or, place INS's enforcement functions in the DHS Bureau of Border Security and INS's service functions in the DHS Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (House-passed H.R. 5710 ).", "In addition to the transfer of INS, there was considerable debate over whether the issuances of visas should remain with the DOS. When the President's proposal to establish DHS ( H.R. 5005 ) was debated, his initial plan to give the DHS Secretary exclusive authority through the Secretary of State to issue or refuse to issue visas was a thorny point. The House Select Committee on Homeland Security approved compromise language on visa issuances in H.R. 5005 that retained DOS's administrative role in issuing visas but added specific language to address many of the policy and national security concerns raised during hearings. An amendment to move the consular affairs visa function to DHS failed when the House passed H.R. 5005 .

At that time, DHS stated that ICE would comprise INS interior enforcement functions, including the detention and removal program, the intelligence program, and the investigations program along with the former U.S. Custom Service interior enforcement activities. The Administration went on to state that CBP would contain the resources and missions relating to borders and ports of entry of the former U.S. Customs Service and the former INS, including the border patrol and the immigration inspections responsibilities, as well as the agricultural inspections function of the Agricultural Quarantine Inspection program.", "The subsequent decision by CBP officials to further integrate the inspection duties so that there is \"one face at the border\" meant that CBP inspectors are essentially interchangeable and responsible for all primary inspections. CBP inspectors are now charged with enforcing a host of laws. The INA requires the inspection of all aliens who seek entry into the United States, and every person is inspected to determine citizenship status and admissibility. All goods being imported into the United States are subject to a customs inspection, but an actual physical inspection of all goods is not required.

The number of apprehensions at the southwest border had decreased until recently, as Figure 9 shows. The reason for the large increase in apprehensions at the southwest border during the late 1990s was due, in large part, to a series of operations that were aimed at stemming illegal migration and interdicting human and drug smugglers.

In terms of employer violations of immigration law, arrests of employers decreased from 17,554 in FY1997 to 445 in FY2003 (final year data were reported). This decline is largely due to shifts in policy away from noncriminal investigations and a reallocation of resources to other immigration enforcement priorities. Arrests of aliens who entered without inspections or violated their immigration status exhibit a steadier trend, but have declined from a high of 14,963 arrests in FY2000 to 9,319 aliens arrested in FY2003.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that the division of customs and immigration inspectors from their related investigative colleagues may be building administrative walls, and hampering cooperation and information sharing, between ICE and CBP in critical mission areas. Some observers also have suggested that the distinction between the 'interior enforcement' activities of ICE and the 'border security' functions of CBP are artificial constructs that contribute to needless administrative overlaps, programmatic turf battles, mission gaps, and sometimes dangerous operational conflicts.", "The media often center on anecdotal criticisms by stakeholders. One recent article reported that", "[t]he official said one of the biggest problems is ICE and CBP have separate legal offices, which sometimes hand down differing legal interpretations. Disputes also have arisen when ICE wants to parole an illegal immigrant in order to pursue investigative leads, but CBP objects, the official added. Advocates of stronger immigration enforcement argue that former Customs agents at ICE do not fully understand immigration laws and are more interested in performing investigations than enforcing immigration rules.", "Cable network news shows frequently feature problems along the U.S. border in regular segments. Surveys of public opinion indicate a particular concern with illegal immigration, and a recent survey reported that 61% of respondents disapprove of the Administration's handling of illegal immigration.", "In addition to the concerns over the integration of ICE and CBP and their roles in abating illegal immigration, there is a reported lack of coordination between USCIS and ICE in the area of fraud and national security investigations. USCIS established the Office of Fraud Detection and National Security to work with the appropriate law enforcement entities to handle national security and criminal \"hits\" on aliens and to identify systemic fraud in the application process. Many of these duties were formerly performed by the INS enforcement arm that is now part of ICE. The GAO has reported that \"The difficulty between USCIS and ICE investigations regarding benefit fraud is not new.... As a result, some USCIS field officials told us that ICE would not pursue single cases of benefit fraud. ICE field officials who spoke on this issue cited a lack of investigative resources as to why they could not respond in the manner USCIS wanted.\"", "Moreover, USCIS appears to have problems of its own. The DHS Inspector General found problems in the background checks for which USCIS is now responsible. Among other findings, the report concluded that USCIS's security checks are overly reliant on the integrity of names and documents that applicants submit and that \"USCIS has not developed a measurable, risk-based plan to define how USCIS will improve the scope of security checks.\" It further stated that \"USCIS's management controls are not comprehensive enough to provide assurance that background checks are correctly completed.\"", "Pending caseloads and processing backlogs continue to plague USCIS. GAO concluded that it is unlikely that USCIS will completely eliminate the backlog of pending adjudications by the deadline of 2006.

These identified problems have ranged from USCIS processing of background checks and adjudication of benefits, ICE worksite enforcement efforts and information technology systems, and cooperation between CBP and ICE on the U.S.-VISIT system. Indeed, the GAO has concluded that many of the management problems that plagued the former INS remain with the DHS organizational structure.", "The paucity of evaluations that describe successes resulting from the current organization of immigration functions does not necessarily mean that the restructuring is failing. By their very nature, inspector general reports tend only to focus on areas that need improvement.
