On average, foreign markets absorb about one-fifth of U.S. agricultural production, thus contributing significantly to the health of the farm economy. The positive economic effects of trade in farm products are felt well beyond the farm gate. Farm product exports make up about 10% of total U.S. exports and contribute positively to the U.S. balance of trade. The economic benefits of agricultural exports also extend across rural communities, while overseas farm sales help to buoy a wide array of industries linked to agriculture, including transportation, processing, and farm input suppliers. Moreover, most of the future growth in food demand is expected to occur in developing countries.", "Congress has traditionally displayed a keen interest in agricultural trade issues given their importance to farmers and ranchers and to the overall economy. The plethora of agriculture-related policy questions and trade issues in play as the 115th Congress convenes suggests that trade policy in general, as well as specific farm trade issues, may continue to draw congressional oversight and input. One ongoing concern has centered on the trade-distorting domestic policies abroad, including in China, which ranked as the second largest market for U.S. farm exports in FY2016. In late 2016 the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) launched two trade enforcement actions against China at the World Trade Organization (WTO) over its administration of tariff rate quotas for imports of wheat, rice, and corn and over its domestic support measures for these crops.", "On the multilateral front, President Trump has ordered the withdrawal of the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) regional free trade agreement (FTA), which the United States and 11 other Pacific-facing nations signed but which Congress has not ratified. As negotiated, TPP would have significantly improved access for U.S. farm exports. USTR continues to negotiate with the European Union (EU) over a regional FTA\u2014the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP)\u2014involving a number of thorny agricultural issues that have proved to be impediments to trade, including differences over geographic indications (GI) and discontinuity in regulating the application of biotechnology to agricultural production, as well as access for these products to commercial markets. The United Kingdom vote to exit the EU has added to the already uncertain prospects for T-TIP.", "At the global level, further liberalization of agricultural trade is an objective of the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations under the WTO, but those talks have been at an impasse for several years. Of concern to the developing world, the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP)\u2014which provides duty-free tariff treatment for certain products from developing countries and benefits from $2.6 billion in U.S. agricultural imports in 2015\u2014will expire at the end of 2017 unless Congress extends it.", "Beyond trade agreements, numerous other trade issues of importance to U.S. agriculture may be of interest to Congress. For one, suspension agreements that limit Mexico's sugar exports to the United States have come under increasing criticism from U.S. stakeholders and may have implications for the U.S. sugar program. In Cuba, U.S. farm and food interests see potential to meaningfully expand exports, but a prohibition on private U.S. financing is viewed as a major obstacle to this end. U.S. dairy interests object to a Canadian dairy ingredient pricing strategy that it believes is aimed at displacing U.S. ingredient exports. U.S. exports of beef, pork, and chicken continue to face bans and trade restrictions over disease outbreaks that are inconsistent with international trade protocols. Examples include China's ongoing bans on imports of U.S. beef and poultry and restrictions imposed by several foreign markets on U.S. ractopamine-fed pork. As the 115th Congress convenes, the United States has settled two long-running WTO challenges to its policies: one to its cotton program and another to its country-of-origin labeling (COOL) law."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview of U.S. Agricultural Exports1", "paragraphs": ["U.S. agricultural exports have long been a bright spot in the U.S. balance of trade, with exports exceeding imports in every year since 1960, although in recent years the value of farm exports have experienced a downturn from the record level recorded in FY2014. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) forecasts U.S. agricultural exports in FY2017 will reach $134 billion. If realized, this total would represent a moderate rebound from FY2016, when exports sank to $129.7 billion, which was $10 billion below the FY2015 total and more than $20 billion below the peak of $152.3 billion in FY2014. The decline in the value of farm exports in recent years has reflected mainly lower market prices for bulk commodities. U.S. agricultural imports are forecast to total $113.5 billion in FY2017, essentially unchanged from $113.1 billion in FY2016, resulting in an agricultural trade surplus of $19.5 billion. This would compare favorably with a surplus of $13.9 billion in FY2016 but would still be well below the high of $43.1 billion in FY2014.", "Agricultural exports are important both to farmers and to the U.S. economy. From 2013 to 2015\u2014the most recent calendar years for which figures are available\u2014the value of U.S. agricultural exports accounted for 10% and 11% of total U.S. exports and 5% of total U.S. imports, according to USDA. As for the contribution of U.S. agricultural exports to the overall economy, USDA's Economic Research Service estimates that in 2014 each dollar of agricultural exports stimulated an additional $1.27 in business activity. Moreover, that same year, agricultural exports generated an estimated 1,132,000 full-time civilian jobs, including 808,000 jobs outside the farm sector. ", "With the productivity of U.S. agriculture growing faster than domestic demand, farmers and agriculturally-oriented firms rely heavily on export markets to sustain prices and revenue. Within the agricultural sector itself, the importance of exports looms especially large, accounting for around 20% of total farm production by value. Export markets are a major outlet for many farm commodities, in some cases absorbing over one-half of U.S. output, including for wheat, cotton, and some specialty crops.", "Within the overall mix of agricultural exports, soybeans, corn, other feed crops, and wheat continue to rank at or near the top of the list of farm exports by value.

In September 2016, USTR challenged China's domestic support measures for these crops, asserting that the level of government support appears to have been well in excess of China's WTO commitments. The U.S. subsequently filed a separate enforcement action in December 2016 over the same three commodities, alleging that China's management of the tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) for these crops has improperly restricted access to the Chinese market by up to $3.5 billion. Under a TRQ, a lower tariff is levied on import quantities within the quota amount, while a higher rate is imposed on quantities in excess of the quota.", "In the initial action involving China's domestic support measures, USTR contends that the level of support that China has provided for rice, wheat, and corn has exceeded\u2014by nearly $100 million from 2012 through 2015\u2014the level to which the country committed when it joined the WTO of 8.5% of the value of its annual domestic agricultural production. USTR also asserts that China's support levels for domestic production have been above world market prices since 2012, thereby creating an incentive for Chinese farmers to increase production of these crops, which in turn has displaced imports from the United States and elsewhere.", "Concerning the TRQs, USTR asserted that China's administration of them is not transparent, predictable, or fair, citing impermissible restrictions on importation, unclear procedures, and lack of meaningful information on how the TRQs are managed. As a consequence, USTR points out that the TRQs for these crops during the most recent five years (2011-2015) have consistently gone unfilled even though global prices have favored importation. The TRQs, which USTR values at about $7 billion based on Chinese import prices in 2015, are global in nature, making them available to numerous exporters. ", "Status: Following the U.S. trade enforcement action over China's domestic price support levels at the WTO in September, bilateral consultations were undertaken, but no resolution was agreed upon. Thus, in December, USTR requested that WTO establish a dispute settlement panel to examine China's domestic support levels for these crops, a request that was fulfilled in January 2017. Following its WTO challenge of China's administration of TRQs, U.S. officials requested bilateral consultations to seek a mutually agreeable solution before potentially moving to the next level of dispute resolution. If the talks prove to be unproductive, the United States could request that a WTO dispute settlement panel be appointed to examine China's TRQ administration. ", "If the WTO would determine that China's price supports or its administration of its TRQs for wheat, rice, and corn (or both) are WTO inconsistent, then China would be obligated to take corrective measures.

The fate of TPP is uncertain as other countries may seek to ratify a very similar deal without the United States. ", "Concerning agricultural products, the agreement sought to liberalize trade through lower tariffs, expanded TRQs, and agreements over rules and procedures for reducing non-tariff barriers. Export markets are the destination for about 20% of U.S. agricultural production, providing material support for U.S. farm prices and income. As such, the importance of improving access to overseas markets is readily apparent and is expected to factor more importantly in the years ahead, because the growth of food demand abroad is expected to far outpace increases in domestic demand.", "TPP countries represent a major component of U.S. farm and food trade, providing markets for 42% of U.S. farm exports between 2011 and 2015, while also supplying 47% of U.S. agricultural imports. Among the TPP countries, Japan and Vietnam\u2014with a combined population of around 220 million people\u2014were expected to offer the greatest potential for expanding U.S. farm exports under TPP, because the United States does not already have free trade agreements (FTAs) with either country. Also, Japan and Vietnam impose significantly higher average most-favored-nation (MFN) tariffs on imports of agricultural products\u2014at 12.9% and 16.3%, respectively\u2014in 2015 compared with the U.S. average of 5.2%. Thus, tariff reductions under TPP would be expected to improve the competitiveness U.S. farm and food exports compared with domestic suppliers and non-TPP export competitors. ", "As negotiated, TPP would have materially increased the overseas markets to which U.S. farm and food products would have preferential access. In its report of May 2016, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) concluded that TPP would provide significant benefits for U.S. agriculture. ITC projected that by 2032 U.S. agricultural exports would be higher by $7.2 billion, or 2.6%, under TPP than without the agreement, reflecting lower tariffs and expanded tariff-rate quotas, while U.S. farm imports would total $2.7 billion higher, or 1.5%. Most of the increase in U.S. exports would have been concentrated in Japan (up $3.6 billion) and Vietnam (up $3.3 billion). Beyond market access changes, TPP included new rules and procedures for addressing non-tariff barriers that impede trade, including sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures that address food safety, plant pests and animal diseases.

But support for TPP within agriculture, while broad-based, was not universal. A number of groups representing agriculture and food industry interests opposed the agreement, reflecting concerns about competition from imports, the lack of a strong enforcement mechanism against currency manipulation, and the potential offshoring of jobs in the food processing sector.

Some of the principal objectives of U.S. agricultural interests include expanding market access for U.S. agricultural exports, addressing regulatory concerns regarding certain SPS and related non-tariff trade measures, and addressing concerns about EU products characterized by \"geographical indications\" (GIs). Complicating the U.S.-EU negotiations regarding agricultural issues are major underlying regulatory and administrative differences between the United States and the EU in how each addresses issues of food safety and public health, as well as intellectual property rights for some types of agricultural products. In addition, the T-TIP negotiations on agricultural products need to be viewed in the context of a series of long-standing, high-profile transatlantic trade disputes between the United States and the EU across a range of trade issues. ", "In 2015, U.S. exports of agricultural products to the EU totaled $12 billion, while EU exports of agricultural products to the United States totaled $20 billion, resulting in a substantial trade deficit of nearly $8 billion for the United States. The WTO reports that the simple average MFN tariff applied to agricultural product imports in the United States was 5.1% in 2014, compared to an average of 12.2% for the EU. Including all products imported under an applied tariff and TRQ, USDA reports that the calculated average rate across all U.S. agricultural imports is roughly 12% overall, well below the EU's average of 30%. Restrictive TRQs on agricultural products are also a concern for U.S. exporters. A USDA study reports that removing tariffs and TRQs could increase U.S. agricultural exports to the EU by an estimated $5.5 billion (compared to a 2011 base year). EU exports to the United States are estimated to rise by $0.8 billion. These totals cover all current 28 EU member states. ", "High tariff barriers are further exacerbated by additional non-tariff barriers that may limit U.S. agricultural exports. Addressing non-tariff barriers is another major goal of the U.S. agricultural sectors in the negotiation covering certain SPS concerns. These include delays in reviews of biotech products (limiting U.S. exports of grain and oilseed products), prohibitions on growth hormones in beef production and certain antimicrobial and pathogen reduction treatments (limiting U.S. meat and poultry exports), and burdensome and complex certification requirements (limiting U.S. exports of processed foods, animal products, and dairy products). As such, T-TIP negotiations on agricultural products are conditioned by a number of these long-standing, high-profile transatlantic trade disputes between the United States and EU. Other EU regulations of concern to U.S. exporters include lack of a science-based focus in establishing SPS measures, difficulty meeting food safety standards and obtaining product certification, lack of cohesive labeling requirements, and stringent testing requirements that are often applied inconsistently across EU member nations. USDA reports that removing select non-tariff barriers affecting meats, field crops, and fruits and vegetables could raise U.S. exports to the EU by an additional $4.1 billion over gains estimated from removing tariffs and TRQs (compared to a 2011 base year) across all current 28 EU member states. Major differences exist in how the United States and the EU apply SPS and technical barriers to trade and how each regulates food safety and related public health protection.

That outcome remains uncertain, in part reflecting the complexity of the issues involved and the politically sensitive nature of a number of them. In addition, in June 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) voted to exit the EU (referred to as \"Brexit\"), and it remains to be seen what impact this will have on the T-TIP negotiation, since the UK accounts for a sizeable share (about 15%) of U.S. agricultural exports to the EU each year, and the exclusion of the UK from the EU could significantly reduce potential U.S. trade gains under a negotiated agreement.

In addition, U.S. dairy interests are concerned about an ingredient pricing strategy the Canadian dairy industry is pursuing. U.S. interests assert that it is intended to further discourage imports of certain U.S. milk product exports to Canada, including ultra-filtered milk, while also facilitating exports of Canadian skim milk products beyond their allowable WTO commitments. ", "Ultra-filtered milk is a high-protein liquid product that results from separating and concentrating certain milk components (such as protein and fat) for use in the production of dairy products, such as cheese, yogurt, and ice cream. U.S. ultra-filtered milk found a market among Canadian cheese makers after Canada revised its compositional standards for cheese in 2008, which significantly reduced the use of several milk products that U.S. processors had been supplying to Canadian food manufacturers, including milk protein concentrates and dried protein products. ", "In 2016, in order to make Canadian dairy ingredients competitive with imported products, the province of Ontario adopted a special pricing program (Class 6) that allows for the sale of various domestic dairy ingredients at world market prices rather than the typically higher prices that would prevail under Canada's supply management system. The price farmers receive for milk is adjusted to reflect the Class 6 ingredient prices. U.S. dairy interests contend that the program favors Canadian milk products at the expense of imports, including U.S. milk product exports such as ultra-filtered milk. U.S. dairy interests are concerned that a broadly similar approach to pricing ingredients that was introduced across Canada last year (and is currently in place on a temporary basis) could be further expanded and implemented longer term if the Canadian Dairy Commission and provincial marketing boards approve a proposed National Ingredients Strategy.", "According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Canada ranked as the largest U.S. export market for ultra-filtered milk in 2015 with sales of $149 million. U.S. exports of ultra-filtered milk enter Canada duty-free, and U.S. dairy producers, processors, and exporters view Ontario's Class 6 ingredients pricing initiative\u2014and the prospect for a similar Canada-wide program\u2014as an attempt to displace these U.S. exports with domestically sourced dairy ingredients. The U.S. dairy industry also contends that this strategy allows Canadian products to be sold below the cost of production, placing similar U.S. products at a disadvantage in Canada, as well as in other export markets where U.S. exporters compete with similar Canadian products. In sum, the U.S. industry asserts that Canadian policies amount to violations of their commitments under NAFTA and the WTO. ", "An additional concern for the U.S. dairy industry is that Canadian dairy farmers and some Canadian officials refer to U.S. exports of diafiltered milk as being a product that is distinct from ultra-filtered milk. The U.S. industry asserts that diafiltration is merely one step in the ultra-filtration process that does not create a fundamentally different product. The significance is that Canada's compositional standards for cheese do not prescribe limits on the content of milk or ultra-filtered milk, whereas limitations do apply to the content of other dairy products that can be used to make cheese.

In general, the act's new farm safety net shifts support away from classification under the WTO's green and amber boxes and toward the blue and amber boxes, indicating a potentially more market-distorting U.S. farm policy regime. Such spillovers, if measurably harmful to foreign export competitors or producers, could lead to challenges under the WTO's dispute settlement process (see \" U.S.-Brazil WTO Cotton Dispute Settlement \" at the end of this report).

Most corn (93%) and soybean (97%) base acres signed up for ARC, while nearly all rice (99%) and peanut (100%) base acres are signed up for PLC. Wheat base was split 58% for ARC and 42% for PLC. Payments under these two programs are delayed substantially because the payment formula for both programs requires complete data from a crop's market year. For example, payments under ARC and PLC for the 2014 crop year are not announced until October 2015, which pushes the actual outlays into the 2016 fiscal year. As a result, ARC and PLC payment data is available only for the 2014 and 2015 crops, but already it has accumulated to over $13 billion for the first two years of these programs. While this sum is substantial, it is uncertain how it may be viewed by foreign competitors that have used the WTO dispute settlement mechanism in the past to address their grievances with U.S. domestic support policies. ", "Because ARC and PLC payments are made to a portion (85%) of historical base acres irrespective of actual plantings, the programs are partially decoupled from producer behavior. However, program calculations do require current market prices to determine if a payment has been triggered, thus partially coupling them to market conditions. The partial decoupling of both ARC and PLC is in deference to WTO rules. Furthermore, ARC's use of a moving average formula based on historic prices and yields is also in response to a WTO panel stipulation to consider market conditions in setting program support levels, while PLC\u2014with a statutorily fixed reference price\u2014fails on this later point.", "An additional WTO consideration is that projected outlays under the new 2014 farm bill's shallow-loss and counter-cyclical price support programs may make it difficult for the United States to agree to future reductions in allowable caps on domestic support expenditures and related de minimis exclusions, as envisioned in ongoing WTO multilateral trade negotiations.", "Status: Most studies suggest that, for U.S. program spending to exceed the $19.1 billion cumulative spending limit, a combination of worst-case events would have to occur.

In this manner, GIs can be commercially valuable. GIs may also be eligible for relief from acts of infringement or unfair competition. The use of GIs may also protect consumers from deceptive or misleading labels.

U.S. soybean, cotton, and corn farmers have rapidly adopted genetically engineered (GE) varieties of these crops since commercialization began in 1996. The United States is the leading country in planting GE crops, accounting for more than 40% of acres growing GE crops worldwide. GE varieties now dominate soybean, cotton, and corn production in the United States.", "Elsewhere in the world, however, the adoption and cultivation of GE crops by both producers and consumers has been more mixed. In the EU, for example, GE crops play a much more limited role. In the EU, GE crop production accounts for only about 1% of EU crop acreage, all in a single variety of pest-resistant GE corn. This GE corn is cultivated mostly in Spain, with Portugal, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Romania having much smaller GE acreage. Several EU countries have completely banned the cultivation of GE crops in their territories or have specific rules on the trade of GE seeds. While EU officials have been cautious in permitting GE products to be cultivated in the EU, EU-approved varieties of GE commodities can be imported. To date, very few GE varieties have been authorized (approved) by EU authorities for commercial cultivation. All GE-derived food and feed must be labeled as such. The EU's regulatory framework regarding biotechnology is generally regarded as one of the most stringent, and more onerous, systems worldwide. Many U.S. producers assert that EU labeling and traceability regulations and the lack of timelines and transparency in the EU process for admitting GE crops and that products approved in the U.S. have effectively limited certain U.S. agricultural exports to the EU. This could become a more contentious issue in the context of the T-TIP negotiations. Also, in January 2015, the European Parliament voted to allow each member country to ban or approve GE crops in their respective territories. This action will likely further complicate T-TIP negotiations on biotechnology policy.", "While the EU as a policymaking entity generally supports GE production, public opinion remains strongly opposed to GE food and crops in most EU member states. This opposition in the EU has also been an important factor in the acceptance of GE crops in lesser developed countries (LDC). Nine of the 14 LDCs to have approved commercial planting of GE crops are in Latin America. Most African countries have largely followed the EU in restricting or banning the cultivation of GE crops. South Africa, Egypt, Burkina Faso, and Sudan are the only African countries where GE crops are grown commercially. The Philippines is the only Asian country to have approved a GE crop for cultivation other than cotton. India, China, and Pakistan are also major producers of GE cotton.", "U.S.-China negotiations on agricultural biotechnology have also seen little progress on approving GE crops.

That commitment did not include specific details of what China would actually do to improve the process. Both China and the United States reaffirmed the importance of implementing transparent and predictable approval processes for agricultural biotechnology products.

Meat and poultry products processed with PRTs are judged safe by the United States and also by European food safety authorities.

The agriculture negotiations have focused on three broad areas\u2014domestic agricultural support programs, market access, and export competition\u2014often referred to as the three pillars of the WTO's Agreement on Agriculture.", "Agriculture negotiations in the Doha Round have attempted to maintain a balance across the three pillars by simultaneously achieving concessions from exporters and importers alike in the form of tighter spending limits on trade-distorting domestic support; elimination of export subsidies and new disciplines on other forms of export competition; and expansion of market access by lowering tariffs, increasing quota commitments, and limiting the use of import safeguards and other trade barriers. From the U.S. perspective, a successful Doha Round would substantially increase access for U.S. agricultural products in foreign markets in exchange for significantly lowering allowable spending limits for certain types of U.S. domestic support and ending export subsidies.", "Proponents assert that a successful WTO Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations offers the prospect of enormous market efficiencies and trade gains. The largest potential area of gain for the United States is in expanded market access to foreign consumers. However, U.S. trade officials, Members of Congress, and commodity groups have expressed concern that the current WTO Doha Round draft agreement on agricultural trade liberalization includes too many exceptions for foreign importers to ensure an adequate balance between potential market access gains for U.S. agricultural products and U.S. domestic support reduction concessions. For additional detail, see CRS Report RS22927, WTO Doha Round: Implications for U.S. Agriculture .", "Status: By 2009, outstanding differences in the Doha Round had been reduced to a short list of contentious issues, including designating additional products as \"sensitive,\" coupled with establishing new tariff quotas; designating developing country products as \"special,\" and thus exempt from tariff reductions; and allowing developing countries to raise tariffs temporarily to deal with import surges or price declines. However, these differences proved sufficient to deadlock the negotiations. The Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations has been at an impasse since 2009 and presently shows no signs of restarting, despite an interim agreement reached at the December 2013 Bali Ministerial.

The package has measures dealing with four principal categories: Trade Facilitation, Agriculture (with five sub-issues described below), and Development and Least-Developed Country (LDC) Issues. From the United States' viewpoint, the major policy initiative is the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), which aims to improve the efficiency of international trade by harmonizing and streamlining customs procedures such as duplicative documentation requirements, customs processing delays, and nontransparent or unequally enforced importation rules and requirements. Implementation of the Bali Package is expected to facilitate U.S. and international agricultural trade\u2014slowly at first but more substantially longer term.", "With respect to agricultural interests, the Bali Agreement addressed five issues: (1) export competition \u2014 reconfirms a commitment to eliminate all export subsidies as part of the ongoing Doha Round, and asks for greater transparency and restraint in their use prior to their final elimination; (2) tariff rate quota (TRQ) administration \u2014 addresses persistently under-filled quotas; (3) temporary peace clause (established through 2017) \u2014 provides relief from challenge under the WTO dispute settlement process for a developing country's above-market purchases of commodities for food-security stockholding programs (described in more detail below), while working to find a permanent solution; (4) proposed list of green - box-eligible LDC-focused general services \u2014 adds new criteria of particular interest to developing countries to existing exemptions; and (5) cotton \u2014 regrets lack of progress in addressing LDC-related cotton issues, reiterates commitment to progress in negotiations on cotton, commits to meet twice yearly to study related issues, and reaffirms the importance of cotton to LDCs. At the time, analysts predicted that a successful Bali Package\u2014boosted primarily by substantial efficiencies in trade facilitation\u2014could increase global gross domestic product by $1 trillion . However, many hope that its ultimate benefit will be a rejuvenation of the Doha Round. For more details, see CRS Report R43592, Agriculture in the WTO Bali Ministerial Agreement . ", "Status: Implementation of the Bali Agreement and the five agriculture sub-issues are not expected to present any significant difficulties for the United States. The 2014 farm bill eliminated the last U.S. export subsidy program\u2014the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP), while the green box changes and proposed cotton negotiations are extensions of the status quo. In contrast, in the long run both the streamlined trade facilitation and the TRQ administration initiative are expected to result in lower marketing costs and positive market access gains for U.S. agricultural exports. However, developments in regards to the food-security stockholding programs (see \" U.S.-India Agricultural Trade Issues \" below) merit special attention and monitoring to avoid potential disruptions to commercial trade activity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S.-India Agricultural Trade Issues76", "paragraphs": ["A key unresolved negotiating issue from the Doha Round is the specifics of a proposed SSM\u2014a controversial safeguard mechanism that could be used by developing countries to temporarily protect producers of special products when imports surge. Disagreement over the size of surge in import volume needed to trigger a Special Safeguard Mechanism (SSM), as well as the size of the temporary SSM tariff, is a primary factor behind the current impasse of the Doha Round. Two key opponents in the SSM debate were India (joined by China) and the United States (joined by the European Union and most of the Cairns Group of countries). The SSM issue remains largely unresolved, and the Doha Round remains deadlocked and moribund.", "A similar fate was narrowly avoided by the Bali Agreement when India proposed delaying the July 31 deadline for approval of the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) protocol until a permanent solution was reached on the issue of food stockholding programs. India wanted a permanent solution to exempt such programs\u2014in which governments buy domestic commodities at above-market prices to distribute to poor populations\u2014from counting toward WTO subsidy limits. Several WTO members, including the United States, preferred a temporary agreement followed by discussions regarding safeguards to prevent food stocks from leaking into commercial markets before a permanent agreement could be reached. The impasse was resolved in November 2014, when the United States and India reached an understanding on food stockholding that would permit the WTO to move forward with full implementation of the Bali Agreement.", "Disagreement between the United States and India within WTO multilateral trade negotiations are at least partially responsible for the current stalemate in the Doha Round of negotiations and nearly sidelined the recently completed Bali Agreement. Progress in bilateral negotiations between India and the United States over a food-security stockholding program were the key to breaking a deadlock in the Bali Agreement and could play a similar role for the currently stymied Doha Round negotiations as regards disagreement over a SSM.", "Status: U.S. and Indian trade negotiators managed to find agreement on the food stockholding issue within the context of the Bali Agreement, suggesting that a parallel pattern could perhaps be adopted to address lingering trade issues such as the SSM within the Doha Round of negotiations. While the Doha Round involves several other major trade partners, each with their own set of special interests, it is undeniable that, were the United States and India to find agreement on the SSM issue, such agreement could provide special impetus to find agreement on the remaining unresolved Doha Round issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Country-of-Origin Labeling (COOL)77", "paragraphs": ["In March 2009, USDA implemented a final rule to implement country-of-origin labeling (COOL) to provide consumers information on the origin of fresh fruits and vegetables, fish, shellfish, peanuts, pecans, macadamia nuts, ginseng, and ground and muscle cuts of beef, pork, lamb, chicken, and goat.

In 2011, the WTO found that COOL treated imported livestock less favorably than U.S. livestock and did not meet its objective to provide complete information to consumers on the origin of meat products. The United States appealed the WTO ruling, but the Appellate Body upheld the findings. USDA issued a revised COOL rule in May 2013, which required that production steps\u2014born, raised, and slaughtered, by origin country\u2014be included on meat labels, but in 2014 the WTO found that the revised COOL regulations still violated its WTO obligations by discriminating against imported livestock. In December 2015, the WTO authorized Canada and Mexico to retaliate against $1 billion worth of products imported from the United States.", "Status : In December 2015, Congress repealed the COOL requirements for beef and pork and ground beef and pork in Section 759 of the enacted Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 ( P.L. 114-113 ).

On October 1, 2014, Brazil and the United States reached an agreement to resolve the long-running cotton dispute when they signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that spelled out the terms of the agreement. Under the MOU, Brazil relinquished its rights to countermeasures against U.S. trade or any further proceedings in the dispute; the United States agreed to new rules governing fees and tenor for the GSM-102 export credit guarantee program; Brazil agreed to a temporary Peace Clause with respect to any new WTO actions against U.S. cotton support programs while the 2014 farm bill is in force or against any agricultural export credit guarantees under the GSM-102 program as long as the program is operated consistent with the agreed terms of the MOU; the United States would make a one-time final payment of $300 million to the Brazil Cotton Institute (BCI) with explicit use-of-fund conditions; and both counties agreed to routine semi-annual reporting under the MOU.", "The successful resolution of the WTO cotton dispute (largely in Brazil's favor) avoided a trade war between two of the world's major agricultural trading nations, the United States and Brazil, while resulting in substantial and substantive changes in U.S. domestic support programs for upland cotton and the U.S. export credit guarantee program. The resolution to the cotton case could have an important bearing on how domestic support programs are treated in future WTO trade negotiations or in future dispute settlement cases. In addition to the implications for domestic support policy, the heightened attention surrounding the WTO Brazil-U.S. cotton case has set precedent by singling out cotton for special treatment within ongoing WTO trade negotiations. Finally, Brazil's successful challenge of certain aspects of the U.S. cotton program under the rules of the WTO's dispute settlement process could serve as a role model for future domestic support-related trade disputes against U.S. farm programs. For more details, see CRS Report R43336, The WTO Brazil-U.S. Cotton Case .", "Status: The inability of the WTO to move forward with the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations suggests that the WTO may not rapidly achieve the global trade goals of its members. As a result, the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism\u2014which remains a primary forum for allowing members to resolve trade grievances\u2014could likely serve as the primary mechanism for effecting future change in domestic support policies. However, there are reasons why challenges may rarely be filed\u2014disputes are economically and diplomatically costly, and a lost challenge can help to legitimize the disputed program."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
