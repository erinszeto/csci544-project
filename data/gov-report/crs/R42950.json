Even as recently as 2011, coal was the fuel used for almost 42% of power generation in the United States accounting for 93% of coal use. Industrial uses represented the remaining 7%. However, in April 2012, coal's share of the power generation market dropped to about 32% (according to Energy Information Administration statistics), equal to that of natural gas. Coal was the fuel of choice because of its availability and the relatively low cost of producing electricity in large, coal-burning power plants which took advantage of coal's low-priced, high energy content to employ economies of scale in steam-electric production. However, coal use for power generation seems to be on the decline, and the magnitude of coal's role for power generation is in question. Two major reasons are generally seen as being responsible: the expectation of a dramatic rise in natural gas supplies, and the impact of environmental regulations on an aging base of coal-fired power plants.", "A recent drop in natural gas prices has been enabled by increasing supplies of natural gas largely due to horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (i.e., fracking) of shale gas formations. If the production can be sustained in an environmentally acceptable manner, then a long-term, relatively inexpensive supply of natural gas could result. Decreased natural gas prices are lowering wholesale electricity prices, stimulating a major switch from coal to gas-burning facilities. The electric utility industry values diversity in fuel choice options since reliance on one fuel or technology can leave electricity producers vulnerable to price and supply volatility. However, an \"inverse relationship\" may be developing for coal vs. natural gas as a power generation choice based on market economics alone, and policies which allow one fuel source to dominate may come at the detriment of the other.", "Coal-fired power plants are among the largest sources of air pollution in the United States. More than half a dozen separate Clean Air Act programs could possibly be used to control emissions, which makes compliance strategy potentially complicated for utilities and difficult for regulators. Because the cost of the most stringent available controls, for the entire industry, could range into the tens of billions of dollars, some power companies have fought hard and rather successfully to limit or delay regulations affecting them, particularly with respect to plants constructed before the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 were passed. The expected retirement of approximately 27 GW of coal-fired capacity by 2016 has been reported to the Energy Information Administration (EIA) by coal plant owners and operators, accounting for approximately 8.5% of U.S. coal-fired capacity. While the costs of compliance with new Environmental Protection Agency regulations are a factor, several other issues are cited by coal plant owners and operators as contributing to these retirement decisions including the age of coal-fired power plants, flat to modest electricity demand growth, the availability of previously underutilized natural gas combined-cycle power plants, and the lower price of natural gas due to shale gas development. Even coal plants which have made significant modifications to meet existing EPA regulations are being closed or mothballed due to a combination of low natural gas prices, and the inability to sell power into other markets.", "EIA expects coal to be a significant part of the U.S. power generation industry's future to well past 2030. But given price competition from natural gas, and emerging environmental regulations, that role will likely be smaller than in recent decades. Coal-fired generation is likely to face a challenging future."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Coal has been the fuel most used for thermal energy since the early days of the Industrial Revolution. However, the mechanization of factories quickly brought a shift in coal use from heat to steam engines, and then to fuel steam turbines to power the electric motors of industry. The advent of electrical lighting and the electrification of buildings and residences drove even greater demand for electricity. For most of the twentieth century, the primary use of coal in the United States was for electric power generation. ", "In 2011, 93% of coal consumed in the United States was for electric power production, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Figure 1 shows the use of the four major types of coal produced in the United States, with bituminous and subbituminous coal dominating electric power generation. ", "The various types of coal differ mostly in carbon content and heating value:", "Anthracite has the highest carbon content (between 86% and 98%), and a heat value of about 15,000 British Thermal Units (BTUs) per pound. Anthracite coal is a small part of the electric power market, and is mostly found in the Appalachian region of Pennsylvania.", "Bituminous is the most abundant form of coal in the United States, and is the type most commonly used to generate electricity. Bituminous coal has a carbon content of approximately 45% to 86%, and a heat value between 10,500 BTUs and 15,500 BTUs.", "Subbituminous coal is mostly found in six western states and Alaska. It has a carbon content of between 35% and 45%, and a heat value of between 8,300 BTUs and 13,000 BTUs. Subbituminous coal generally has a lower sulfur content than other types of coal.", "Lignite has the lowest carbon content of the four types of coal generally used for electric power generation, averaging between 25% and 35%, and a high moisture and ash content. It also has the lowest heat value ranging between 4,000 BTUs and 8,300 BTUs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Electric Power Generation", "paragraphs": ["For most of the history of power generation in the United States, coal has been the dominant fuel used to produce electricity. Even as recently as 2011, coal was used to fuel almost 42% of power generation in the United States, as shown in Figure 2 . Coal has been the fuel of choice for many decades because of its wide availability, and the relatively low cost of producing electricity in large, coal-burning power plants. Coal's low-priced, high energy content enabled the building of power plants able to take advantage of economies of scale in steam-electric production. ", "In a steam power plant, coal (or other fossil fuel) is burned to provide heat for turning water into steam in a boiler. The steam is then forced under pressure into a steam turbine-driven generator which produces electricity. As of 2011, the U.S. coal-powered generation fleet consisted of 1,387 units with a nameplate capacity of almost 318 gigawatts (GW) representing approximately 30% of total U.S. generating capacity. Electric utilities and independent power producers are the primary entities involved in U.S. electricity production. Together, these electric power sector participants have combined for an average annual consumption of almost 995 million tons of coal in the period from 2002 to 2011, with electric utilities consuming between 60% to 70% of the total (primarily in base load power plants). ", "The capital costs of power plant construction (i.e., the costs of finance and construction) vary according to the type (for example, coal or nuclear), and size of power plant. The cost for these plants to generate electricity is largely based on their cost of fuel, as well as operations and maintenance costs, other capital costs, and how the power plant is operated (for example, whether the facility is run as a base load or peaking facility). While the regulatory regime (i.e., under a rate-regulated or competitive environment), costs of transmission and distribution, and weather are strong determinants, the cost of fuel is often the major factor affecting electricity production especially for power plants which have already recovered their capital costs of construction.", "Transportation costs for coal have historically been a major consideration in the choice of coal as a fuel. Barge transport is used where river access is available. But rail transportation is the most common mode of transit for coal as unit trains offer the ability to transport large shipments to power plants on a regular basis. However, rail transportation can be costly. ", "First, coal-burning electric power plants receive approximately 72 percent of their coal by rail. Second, rail transportation costs account for a sizable share of total delivered costs. While, on average, transportation costs account for approximately 20 percent of total [delivered] costs, they can reach as high as 59 percent on shipments of coal originating in the Powder River Basin. ", "U.S. coal transportation costs are cited as a major reason why many utilities in the New England states have chosen to generate electricity with natural gas, or import coal from overseas as a lower cost alternative."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recent Changes in Markets for Electricity Fuels", "paragraphs": ["The amounts of coal consumed for electricity generation from 2002 to 2011 are shown in Figure 3 . While coal was the dominant fuel for electricity production in the period, the trend of increasing consumption seems to be slowing with a recent downturn in coal consumption for electricity beginning in about 2008. At the same time, natural gas use for electric power production is rising.", "Increasing supplies of natural gas are largely behind the switch in fuel for power generation. Natural gas prices have been volatile over the last few decades, ranging from less than $2 per million Btus (MMBTU) to over $18 per MMBTU. However, supplies of natural gas increased markedly beginning in 2008-2009 largely due to development of unconventional shale gas through improved drilling and simulation techniques. Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (i.e., fracking) have dramatically improved shale gas production, and the increased supplies of natural gas have caused prices to fall.", "Figure 4 shows natural gas and coal fuel costs for electricity production from 2002 to 2012. The right-most part of the chart is based on monthly data, illustrating the recent drop in natural gas prices for electricity production while coal costs continue to inch higher. The drop in natural gas prices is a major factor in the recent switch from coal to gas-burning facilities, since the cost of fuel is a major determinant in the dispatch of electricity production. Switching from coal to gas generation has largely involved a switch from base load coal generation to intermediate load natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) capacity. There are varying amounts of underutilized NGCC capacity available in various regions of the United States. That underutilized capacity resulted largely from the natural gas \"bubble\" of the 1980s and 1990s when natural gas prices were generally about $2 per MMBTU. ", "Fuel cost to generate electricity is the key in the decision to switch from coal to natural gas generation. If a power plant was 100% efficient, it would take 3.412 MMBTU to generate 1 MWh of electricity. Assuming that an intermediate capacity NGCC plant is 44.78% efficient, it would consume 7.619 MMBTUs to generate 1 MWh of electricity. Similarly, a base load coal plant with an efficiency of 33.64% would use 10.412 MMBTUs to generate 1 MWh of electricity. The cost of fuel to generate 1 MWh of electricity from coal has historically been lower than the cost to generate power from natural gas. The economics are now changing with coal prices rising and the drop in natural gas prices in 2011 down to levels where it now becomes more expensive to generate electricity from coal, especially when power plant efficiency is taken into account.", "While the chart in Figure 5 shows the expected rise and fall of power production with the seasons in the 2009 to 2012 timeframe, a look behind the numbers reveals the shift in generation as more power is being dispatched from higher efficiency natural gas-fired power plants. During this time, coal's share of total U.S electricity generation has dropped and the use of natural gas to generate electricity has risen as newer, more efficient natural gas-fired generating capacity are being dispatched. In April 2012, for the first time in history, the amount of electricity generation from natural gas equaled that of coal, according to EIA statistics, each with about 32% of the market.", "Many in the energy industry believe that a structural change in the economics of natural gas use has begun.", "While coal is projected to retain the largest share of the electricity generation mix through 2035, analyses included in the Annual Energy Outlook 2012 ... anticipate its share declining as more generation comes from natural gas and renewable technologies. Coal's role as the preeminent source of electricity generation in the United States has lessened in recent years, declining from 49% of total electricity generation in 2007 to 42% in 2011.... Projected fuel prices and economic growth are key factors influencing the future electricity generation mix. The price of natural gas, coal's chief competitor, has dropped significantly in recent years due to the increase in domestic production of natural gas. ", "Nevertheless, there is still much debate as to whether the \"shale gas revolution\" will result in a predictable, long-term increase in supplies of natural gas at relatively low prices. ", "Considerable uncertainty exists regarding the size of the economically recoverable U.S. shale gas resource base and the cost of producing those resources. Across four shale gas resource scenarios from the [EIA's] Annual Energy Outlook 2012, natural gas prices vary by about $4/MMBtu in 2035, demonstrating the significant impact that shale gas resource uncertainty has in determining future natural gas prices. This uncertainty exists primarily because shale gas wells exhibit a wide variation in their initial production rate, rate of decline, and estimated ultimate recovery per well (or EUR, which is the expected cumulative production over the life of a well). ", "If these previously unconventional shale gas resources can be economically developed and produced in an environmentally acceptable manner, then a sustained, relatively inexpensive supply of natural gas could persist. ", "As long as natural gas prices are \"relatively\" high, development of resources will continue. When a surplus of natural gas supplies causes the price to drop, resource development activities solely focused on natural gas tend to curtail. But fracking of shale gas resources is changing the outlook for natural gas supplies, and the recovery of oil from wet shale plays is currently driving development. Even so, the expectation of lower, less volatile prices from increased supplies is encouraging the greater use of natural gas for electric power generation and other industrial uses. Natural gas prices are still subject to forces of supply and demand, with the cost of developing incremental supplies determining future supplies of the resource. Further development of the interstate pipeline system may also be needed if these new natural gas supplies are to reach markets.", "How the natural gas industry will accommodate the expected demands of the power generation industry for gas supplies is also uncertain. Power plants purchase coal under long-term contracts, amassing the fuel on-site in large, managed coal storage piles which may hold a 30-day supply. Most natural gas power generation plants are served directly by pipelines, and manage the fuel as more of a \"just-in-time\" resource, since power plants typically do not have large natural gas storage capabilities. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission observes that based on recent supply issues, this new volume of expected demand for natural gas may require more longer term coordination and planning between the electricity and natural gas supply industries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Coal Plant Retirements", "paragraphs": ["All power plants are subject to retirement when they reach they reach the end of their useful service life. While older coal-fired power plants are usually well-maintained, they are generally not as efficient as newer power plants. As power plants age, they are generally upgraded to continue operations, but the least efficient plants may be retired. Other plants may be shifted from base load operations (in which they essentially operate around the clock) to less demanding intermediate or peaking schedules. The cost of building a power plant is generally recovered over the depreciable life of the asset, such that operations and maintenance (O&M) expenses become the major component of an older power plant's continuing costs. A major component of O&M is the cost of fuel, and the expectation of continued lower prices for natural gas is weighing on decisions concerning whether many older, less efficient coal power plants will be mothballed or closed altogether. However, the costs of modernizing older power plants to meet new regulatory requirements can be relatively high. When the cost of upgrades to meet new environmental requirements is considered along with (perhaps increasing) O&M expenses, many older coal power plants are likely to face outright retirement decisions.", "Over the last 40 years, Congress has directed EPA to reduce the potential health and environmental impacts of fossil fuel use by limiting emissions by-products or other consequences of combustion processes. These environmental regulatory requirements have been evolving in the last decade due to various challenges to the regulatory implementation of federal laws. Much attention has focused recently on the resulting finalization of some of these regulations, and their potential to contribute to the retirement of some coal-burning power plants. ", "In addition to being the largest source of electric power, coal-fired power plants are among the largest sources of air pollution in the United States. Under the Clean Air Act (CAA), however, they have not necessarily been subject to stringent requirements: emissions and the required control equipment can vary depending on the location of the plant, when it was constructed, whether it has undergone major modifications, the specific type of fuel it burns, and, to some extent, the vagaries of EPA enforcement policies. More than half a dozen separate CAA programs could potentially be used to control emissions, which makes compliance strategy potentially complicated for utilities and difficult for regulators. Because the cost of the most stringent available controls, for the entire industry, could range into the tens of billions of dollars, power companies have fought hard and rather successfully to limit or delay regulations affecting them, particularly with respect to plants constructed before the Clean Air Act of 1970 was passed. However, EPA contends that such costs would be more than outweighed by societal benefits from reduced respiratory and other illnesses\u2014\"externalities\" that are largely not currently accounted for in the price of electricity generation but which are estimated by EPA as costing the United States billions of dollars annually in health care and environmental costs.", "Some of the new rules under development at the EPA would be implemented at the federal level, while others would be implemented at the state level. They include the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (which replaced the Clean Air Interstate Rule); the Utility Maximum Achievable Control Technology (Utility MACT) rule to reduce emissions of mercury, other metallic toxics, acid gases, and organic air toxics; the wet ash classification rule for coal combustion residues; and the Clean Water Act Section 316(b) guidelines for once-through cooling water systems. However, only the Utility MACT rule is currently in effect. EPA also proposed standards for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions which would require all new power plants to restrict carbon dioxide emissions. ", "EPA has yet to propose rules for GHG emissions from existing power plants, as is required by court order. Due to a general perception in the electric power industry that these new and pending environmental regulations present conflating requirements with unrealistic timeframes for compliance, the regulations have come to be referred to by the industry as the \"train wreck\" scenario due to a perception that a negative impact on reliability could result. However, environmental groups, and some in the electric power industry\u2014mainly those with significant investments in nuclear or natural gas-fired generation\u2014consider the concerns overstated.", "In 2011, the North American Reliability Corporation (which has oversight of the bulk electric grid for reliability purposes) analyzed the effects of the proposed EPA regulations for their potential to accelerate retirement of fossil\u2010fired units. The 2011 assessment was a revision of a previous analysis to take into account \"updated assumptions determined from proposed rules, as well as other viewpoints on how the rule will ultimately be carried out (i.e., how states may implement regulations), to determine potential resource adequacy impacts.\" NERC noted that the expected retirements of electric generators are driven by many economic factors, \"not simply the cost of pollution control equipment.\" However, NERC's assessment estimated that between 35 GW and 59 GW of generating capacity could be potentially retired as a result of the proposed EPA rules. NERC summarized its concerns as to the possible effects on reliability:", "Existing and proposed environmental regulations in the U.S. may significantly affect bulk power system reliability depending on the scope and timing of the rule implementation and the mechanisms in place to preserve reliability.", "For its part, the Department of Energy (DOE) estimated in 2011 that new air pollution, water, and waste disposal proposed rules could eventually result in the retirement of between 35 GW and 70 GW of coal-fired capacity. ", "The expected retirement of approximately 27 GW of coal-fired capacity by 2016 has been reported to EIA by coal plant owners and operators, accounting for approximately 8.5% of U.S. coal-fired capacity. While the costs of compliance with new EPA environmental regulations are a factor, several other issues are cited by coal plant owners and operators as contributing to these retirement decisions including the age of coal-fired power plants, modest electricity demand growth, the availability of previously underutilized natural gas combined-cycle power plants, and the lower price of natural gas due to shale gas development. And some coal plants which have made significant modifications to meet existing EPA regulations are being closed or mothballed due to a combination of low natural gas prices, and either transmission congestion or a lack of transmission options to sell power into other markets.", "The implications of coal-fired electric power plant retirements will likely play out on a regional basis, as EPA's rules go through inevitable challenges and modifications as the regulations are finalized. Power generation in the United States varies according to local energy resources, and cost and availability of infrastructure for fuels transportation. The Eastern (except New England) and Midwest regions of the United States are more coal-dependent than the Northeast or Western regions, as shown in Figure 6 .", "Several large regional transmission organizations (RTOs) have undertaken studies of the impact of the new EPA rules. A major question being asked in these studies is whether there will be a risk to reliability based on the timing of requirements, and the scheduling and availability of equipment and personnel to accomplish retrofits of power plants to bring them into compliance with EPA regulations. The results of a study by the Midwest ISO (MISO), the RTO serving 11 states and one Canadian province may provide insights into the implications of both EPA regulations and lower natural gas prices. There is approximately 70 GW of coal-fired capacity in the MISO market, with an average coal plant age of 45 years. The study identified potential retirements because of proposed EPA rules, a low natural gas price, and various levels of carbon mitigation costs. MISO summarized the results of its study noting that EPA regulations and lower natural gas prices would likely result in between 3 GW and 13 GW of coal capacity retirements, with MISO itself likely to see costs of between $32 billion and $33 billion due to EPA compliance retrofit costs, new capacity charges, system energy costs, and transmission system upgrades to maintain reliability. ", "MISO does not own or build power plants. State utility commissions still control the process of new power plant construction in many states. States often require a utility to use integrated resource planning methods to address system needs. If a determination is made that new generating capacity is needed to ensure reliability, then how to requisition that capacity becomes the responsibility of state public utility commissions or the RTO markets. The decision would likely be made according to how they view the effects of coal plant retirements on the levels and types (i.e., base load vs. intermediate or peak load power plants) of capacity that will be needed to serve electricity demands. RTO markets generally rely on price signals to provide an incentive for new generation to enter the market, or employ forward capacity markets with higher prices to encourage new generation to be built. Other \"generation-like\" resources (such as demand response, energy efficiency, and conservation) would also likely be employed to reduce the need for building new capacity. ", "Given that significant underutilized NGCC exists in various U.S. regions, the possibility of further shifting from coal base load plants to natural gas intermediate capacity exists. A recent study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2011 noted that the existing U.S. NGCC generation fleet had an average capacity factor of approximately 41%, while its design capacity allowed such plants to operate at 85%. The MIT study looked at a scenario across selected regions of the United States which mimicked the \"full dispatch\" of existing natural gas combined cycle plants. The study concluded that under such a scenario (while noting that transmission constraints exist), there is \"sufficient surplus NGCC capacity to displace roughly one-third of U.S. coal generation, reducing CO2 emissions from the power sector by 20%.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Role of New and Alternative Power Generation Technologies", "paragraphs": ["According to the EIA, coal is expected to be a key part of electricity generation in the United States well past the year 2030. Electric utilities value diversity in power generation options since reliance on one fuel or technology can leave them vulnerable to price and supply volatility. However, the choices for new power plant technologies will likely be subject to proposed EPA rules limiting GHG emissions. The proposed rule published under the Clean Air Act's New Source Performance Standards program would limit emissions from new power plants to no more than 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide for each megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity produced. Today's NGCC generation emits on average about 800 pounds of carbon per MWh compared to current U.S. coal plants with average emissions of about 1,800 pounds of carbon dioxide per each MWh of electric power produced. The proposed GHG rule would allow an exception for the approximately one dozen new coal plants that are permitted and beginning construction within one year, and would not apply to existing plants. Only new coal plants with carbon capture and storage (CCS) are likely to meet the proposed GHG regulations, and CCS technology is estimated to add about 30% to a coal plant's cost. However, according to EIA, there are no new conventional coal plants expected to come on line after 2012; 2 GW of coal plant capacity with CCS is expected to enter service by about 2017. New advanced NGCC plants entering the market in 2017 are expected to cost approximately $63 per MWh, while new advanced coal plants are estimated to cost $111 per MWh, and advanced coal with CCS is estimated at $139 per MWh. Based on levelized cost estimates alone, new coal generation (even without CCS) may not be competitive with new NGCC given the built-in expectation of future fuel costs in the estimates.", "The variability of most renewable electricity technologies means that these technologies offer limited opportunities for replacing coal generation, and these opportunities vary across the United States. Given that the best wind and solar resources are located far from population centers, opportunities to use wind power and solar power are likely dependent on development of transmission lines. Without major breakthroughs in technology efficiency or energy storage, growth of power generation from all renewable sources is expected to be limited to no more than 16% of all generation by 2035.
