Churches and other houses of worship qualify for tax-exempt status as Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 501(c)(3) organizations. Under the tax laws, these organizations may not participate in political campaign activity. Separate from the prohibition in the tax code, the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) may also restrict the ability of churches to engage in electioneering activities.", "Legislation had been introduced in the past several Congresses that would have allowed churches to participate in at least some campaign activity without jeopardizing their \u00a7 501(c)(3) status. These bills were the Houses of Worship Free Speech Restoration Act, H.R. 235 (109th Congress) and H.R. 235 (108th Congress); a provision briefly included in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, H.R. 4520 (108th Congress); the Houses of Worship Political Speech Protection Act, H.R. 2357 and S. 2886 (107th Congress); and the Bright-Line Act of 2001, H.R. 2931 (107th Congress). In the 110th Congress, H.R. 2275 would have repealed the prohibition against campaign intervention in IRC \u00a7 501(c)(3). Unlike the other bills, H.R. 2275 would have applied to all \u00a7 501(c)(3) organizations and not just churches. No similar legislation has yet been introduced in the 111th Congress.", "This report provides an overview of the tax and campaign finance laws relevant to these bills and a discussion of how each bill would have amended current law.

These organizations may not \"participate in, or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office.\" This is an absolute prohibition. Thus, a church that engages in any amount of campaign activity may have its \u00a7 501(c)(3) status revoked. It may also, either in addition to or in lieu of revocation, be taxed on its political expenditures under IRC \u00a7 4955. The tax equals 10% of the expenditures, which is increased to 100% if the church does not take timely action to recover the expenditures and establish policies preventing future ones. The tax may also be imposed on church managers at lower rates.", "IRC \u00a7 501(c)(3) only prohibits campaign intervention. Other types of political activities are permitted. The line between the two can be difficult to discern. Clearly, churches may not make statements that endorse or oppose a candidate, publish or distribute campaign literature, or contribute to a campaign. On the other hand, they may conduct activities not related to elections, such as issue advocacy and supporting or opposing individuals for nonelective offices. In general, an activity is permissible unless it is structured or conducted in a way that shows bias towards or against a candidate. Thus, churches may do such things as create and distribute voter education materials, host candidate forums, and invite candidates to appear at church functions so long as these activities do not show a preference for or against a candidate. Biases can be subtle, and whether an activity is campaign intervention depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.", "The tax laws do not prohibit religious leaders from participating in campaign activity as individuals. Religious leaders may endorse or oppose candidates in speeches, advertisements, etc., in their capacity as private citizens. A leader may be identified as being from a specific church, but there should be no intimation that he or she is speaking as a representative of the church. The church may not support the activity in any way. Thus, a leader may not make campaign-related statements in the church's publications, at its events, or in a manner that uses its assets. This is true even if the leader pays the costs of the publication or event."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Campaign Finance Law", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), which regulates the raising and spending of campaign funds, is separate and distinct from the tax code. FECA prohibits corporations from using treasury funds to make contributions and expenditures in connection with federal elections, but does not prohibit unincorporated organizations from making such contributions and expenditures. FECA also requires regular filing of disclosure reports by candidates and political committees of contributions and expenditures, and by persons making independent expenditures that aggregate more than $250 in a calendar year. Under FECA, the term \"political committee\" is defined to include any committee, club, association, or other group of persons that receives contributions or makes expenditures aggregating in excess of $1,000 during a calendar year.", "As a result of a 2002 amendment to FECA, corporations\u2014including tax-exempt corporations\u2014are further prohibited from funding \"electioneering communications,\" which are defined as broadcast communications made within 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary that \"refer\" to a federal office candidate. Federal Election Commission (FEC) regulations provide an exception to this prohibition for \"qualified nonprofit corporations,\" which do not include churches.", "In McConnell v. FEC, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of FECA's prohibition on corporate treasury funds being spent for electioneering communications. More recently, however, the Court in Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. v. FEC (WRTL II) found that this prohibition was unconstitutional as applied to ads that Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. sought to run. While not expressly overruling its decision in McConnell v. FEC, which had upheld the provision against a First Amendment facial challenge, the Court limited the law's application. Specifically, it ruled that advertisements that may reasonably be interpreted as something other than an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate are not the functional equivalent of express advocacy, and therefore, cannot be regulated."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Legislation", "paragraphs": ["Bills introduced in the 110 th , 109 th , 108 th , and 107 th Congresses would have allowed churches to engage in some amount of political campaign activity without risking their tax-exempt status.

Thus, they provide examples of various approaches Congress could take, if it so chose, to amend the tax code's prohibition on campaign activity by churches. No such legislation has yet been introduced in the 111 th Congress.", "None of the bills would have changed the reporting requirements under current law. Churches, unlike most tax-exempt organizations, are not required to file an annual information return (Form 990) with the IRS. Tax-exempt organizations permitted to engage in political activities are generally required to report information about those activities on the form's Schedule C.

The bill did not expressly impose any limitation on the amount of permissible campaign activity. However, the existing requirement in I.R.C.\u00a7 501(c)(3) that organizations be \"organized and operated exclusively\" for an exempt purpose would appear to require that any such activity have been insubstantial. Churches and other organizations would have still been subject to tax on their political expenditures, thus possibly providing a disincentive to engage in activities with associated taxable expenditures.

Dissemination would have included a mailing with more than an incremental cost to the church and any electioneering communication. The bill expressly stated that it did not permit disbursements for electioneering communications or political expenditures prohibited by FECA.", "It appears that H.R. 235 would have permitted activities such as the express endorsement of a candidate by church leaders and others during religious services, requests for contributions to candidate committees and other political committees during religious gatherings, and written endorsements in church bulletins and inserts.

Second, churches that unintentionally intervened in a political campaign would not have lost their tax-exempt status or eligibility to receive deductible contributions unless the church or its religious leaders had done so on more than three occasions during the year. Third, unintentional violations of the \u00a7 501(c)(3) prohibition would have been subject to a new excise tax. If the church had at least three unintentional violations during the year, the tax would have equaled the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the church's gross income, contributions, and gifts. If the church had two violations, then the tax would have equaled that amount divided by two. If the church had one violation, then the tax would have equaled the full amount divided by 52. The tax would have been reduced by any amount imposed under \u00a7 4955.", "This bill was more restrictive than the others because it would have only permitted unintentional violations of the campaign prohibition and even those violations would have been fined.
