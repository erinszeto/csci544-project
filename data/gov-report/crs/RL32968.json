Child and Family Services Reviews (CFSRs) gauge state efforts and ability to achieve the primary goals of safety and permanence for children, and well-being for children and their families. The review is intended both to measure state compliance with federal child welfare policy and to strengthen and improve state child welfare programs.", "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) conducted the initial round of onsite reviews between March 2001 and March 2004. No state was found to be in substantial conformity with all of the outcomes and systems assessed. Some critics of the CFSR argue that while the outcomes reviewed are on target, the criteria established to determine state achievement of those outcomes may give misleading information about a state's performance.", "Although much attention has focused on states' uniform inability to meet all of the federal criteria, the reviews also showed certain relative strengths. States showed the greatest ability to ensure that children were not exposed to child abuse and neglect and remained safely in their homes whenever appropriate and possible, and in preserving their family relationships and connections. They had the most difficulty in achieving permanent and stable living arrangements for children, enhancing the capacity of families to meet the needs of their children and in seeing that appropriate mental and physical health services were available to children served. Information regarding ensuring provision of educational services to children was more mixed.", "In addition to reviewing outcomes, the CFSR assesses state compliance with federal child welfare policy by examining certain federally required systems. States were most likely to be found successful at operating a statewide information system; maintaining foster and adoptive parent licensing, training, recruitment and retention; and responding to community concerns. They were least likely to have a strong service array or case review system in place. Ratings of state quality assurance and training systems were more mixed.", "To avoid immediate assessment of penalties for failure to comply with federal policy, each state was required to develop a Program Improvement Plan (PIP). A PIP must address each one of the outcomes or systems with which a state was found to be out of substantial conformity and must describe the state's specific plan for moving toward full conformity with federal policy. A few states have successfully completed their PIPS but most are still in the process of implementing them.", "The Children's Bureau is preparing for a second round of CFSRs, and onsite reviews are scheduled to begin in early 2007.

This report will not be updated."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Child and Family Services Review (CFSR) is the central and most comprehensive component of federal efforts to determine state compliance with federal child welfare policies and, equally, to help ensure that positive outcomes are achieved for the children and families served by state child welfare programs. The review intends to gauge state efforts and ability to achieve the primary goals of safety and permanence for children, along with well-being for children and their families. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) began the first onsite reviews in March 2001 and, as of March 2004, had completed the initial round of the CFSR in all states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. In this report, both the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico will be referred to as \"states.\"", "Many states were found to have substantially achieved the goal of safety, permanence, or well-being for a majority of the cases reviewed and to have in place systems adequate to achieve positive outcomes for children. At the same time, the initial round of CFSRs found that no state's child welfare programs met the criteria that HHS established as demonstrating \"substantial conformity\" with all of federal child welfare policy requirements. As a result, all states have or are implementing Program Improvement Plans (PIPs). To avoid financial penalties associated with noncompliance, states must meet the improvement goals established in their PIP.", "Although the final CFSR regulation states that a subsequent full CFSR is to occur in each state two years after the approval of a state PIP, in practice this has been judged impossible (e.g., such a time frame would mean that a state's second-round CFSR performance would be based on the same data that are used to assess the success of the initial PIP). The second round of CFSRs is now being planned with 15 states (DE, NC, VT, IN, NM, GA, KS, DC, TX, MA, AZ, AL, OK, OR, and MN) slated for an onsite review from March through September 2007.", "This report begins with a short history of the legislation and other factors that led to the creation of the current CFSR and then briefly describes how a CFSR is conducted and what \"substantial conformity\" with federal child welfare policy means in the context of this review. Much has been made of the fact that no state was found to be in substantial conformity with all aspects of federal policy reviewed during the initial (FY2001-FY2004) round of the CFSRs. This report seeks to better understand that fact by looking closely at state performance on each of the performance indicators that determined compliance. Taking apart this general \"not in substantial conformity\" finding permits a more complex understanding of state performance, and the report uses this analysis to identify and discuss those areas in which states showed the greatest inability to achieve compliance with federal policy. (Readers should note that in addition to the text describing state performance, tables included in Appendices B and C of the report provide detailed ratings information for each state and Appendix D presents information on the case characteristics (e.g., age or race/ethnicity of child in case being reviewed vis-\u00e0-vis outcome achievement)). Finally, the report concludes with a brief discussion of 1) how penalties for non-compliance are assessed; 2) the requirement that states not in compliance with federal policy develop Program Improvement Plans (PIPs) ( Appendix A shows the status of PIP implementation); 3) some of the criticisms of how the initial CFSR assessed state performance (especially with regard to the national standards); and 4) planning for the second round of CFSRs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Origins of the CFSR", "paragraphs": ["With the 1980 Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act ( P.L. 96-272 ), Congress established the basic framework for the current federal-state child welfare programs. That legislation created a set of federal protections applicable to all children in foster care (e.g., a written case plan and regular case review). States were required to provide these protections, without regard to a child's eligibility for federal foster care funding, if they wished to ensure receipt of their full funding for Child Welfare Services (authorized under Title IV-B of the Social Security Act). To determine if states were indeed providing these protections to all children and were thus eligible for their full Child Welfare Services allotment HHS created \"427 reviews,\" (which were named for the Section of the Social Security Act that established certain voluntary protections for all foster care children). The 427 review process was established without formal regulations and it came to be viewed as arbitrary, designed only to check policies on paper not in practice, and interested in identifying weaknesses for the purpose of punishment only (not for designing improvements).", "As a part of the Social Security Amendments of 1994 ( P.L. 103-432 ) Congress required HHS to develop a new system of review for state child welfare programs that focused on outcomes achieved for children and families and that would replace the older, and discredited, process-driven reviews. The same 1994 legislation also repealed the former Section 427 but made each of its formerly voluntary protections a part of the Title IV-B state plan requirements. This made the protections mandatory for all foster care children in all states.", "P.L. 103-432 (1994) further provided that the newly designed review system must cover the full range of statutory and regulatory child welfare policies and that the criteria used to measure states' compliance with specific factors were to be spelled out in formal regulations. It added that these regulations were also to detail what the penalties were, tie the amount of any financial penalty assessed to the degree of noncompliance found, suspend withholding of any penalties while states take corrective action, and further, rescind the penalties if a state successfully implemented corrective action. Finally, the legislation required HHS to offer technical assistance to any state needing to take corrective action.", "During the last half of the 1990s HHS consulted with child welfare administrators and conducted 13 pilot reviews. In January 2000, the Department released its final regulation on the Child and Family Services Review (CFSR). Guided in part by the 1997 passage of the Adoption and Safe Families Act ( P.L. 105-89 ), HHS established the overall goals of safety and permanency for children, and well-being for children and families, as the overarching aims of each state child welfare program. To achieve substantial conformity with federal child welfare policy, the final review regulation lists seven specific outcomes that a state must achieve and seven specific systems that a state must demonstrate are in operation. A CFSR Procedures Manual was subsequently produced and listed 45 items\u2014or performance indicators\u2014which were associated with the seven outcomes and seven systems and used to guide the review team through an evaluation of the state's performance. HHS also issued separate policy guidance on six national standards , the concept of which was outlined in the formal regulations, and which were developed as complimentary performance indicators using statewide data.

Whether a state achieved one or more of the seven outcomes in a given case was based on an onsite review of the case records combined with interviews of case-specific individuals (e.g., the foster parents, case worker, and/or child). Using a standardized survey instrument reviewers then determined whether or not each specific outcome was achieved in the case by rating each of the applicable case review indicators.

The national standards used in the initial round of the CFSR were based on state administrative data regarding recurrence of maltreatment, incidence of maltreatment while in foster care, the rate of re-entries to foster care, the stability of foster care placements, and the state's achievement of adoptions and reunifications on a \"timely\" basis. For a state to meet the required national standards, an analysis of statewide administrative data for the 12 months (generally) that were a part of the formal review period must indicate that the state matched or exceeded each of the established national standards.

This is a concern for some, who argue that requiring all states to meet the same national standard for preventing recurrence of maltreatment in foster care might unduly punish states that have enacted broader definitions of child maltreatment and/or that have a well-developed system of reporting and investigation while allowing states with more narrow definitions or less efficient reporting and investigating systems to more easily achieve federal compliance.", "During the course of the initial review and analysis HHS uncovered a separate example of how varied state policy might affect a state's ability to meet the national standards established with regard to recurrence of maltreatment. Close to half of the states reviewed in FY2002-FY2004 (35 states) indicated that child abuse and neglect allegations for families with open child welfare cases (e.g., in-home cases) are not reported as new allegations of abuse or neglect and therefore there is no formal assessment of the validity of the allegation. Instead state policy or practice usually provides that the caseworker assigned to the family would informally assess the information and act to protect the children if necessary. In short, if child maltreatment is identified, this information\u2014while it is likely acted on\u2014would not be reported to the state's National Child Abuse and Neglect Database and thus would not be a part of the statewide data used to determine whether or not a state meets the standard on recurrence of maltreatment.", "The composition of a state's caseload may also vary for reasons that are not in control of the child welfare agency or, again, because of state policy decisions.

In reviewing findings from the initial CFSR, the report General Findings from the Federal Child and Family Services Review, analyzed certain characteristics of the case review sample and the degree of success achieved on certain outcomes. For the most part this analysis found that a state's overall performance on the CFSR outcomes\u2014when compared to all other states\u2014was largely unaffected by the significant state variation in the case sample demographics (including age, race/ethnicity, primary reason for case opening, and geographic location). The single exception to this overall finding was in regard to the age of children in a state's case review sample, and state performance on the safety outcome: children are safely maintained in their own homes whenever appropriate and possible. States with a higher percentage of children in their case review sample that were younger than age six at the time of their entry into foster care had a lower percentage of cases rated as substantially achieving that outcome.", "At the same time, many more significant relationships were established when the lens of the analysis was shifted from a comparison between states' performance to the relationship between the particular characteristics of a child in a given case and the performance ratings for cases with children of similar or different characteristics.

The most basic concerns the accuracy and comparability of the data. The majority of the data used to set the national standards as well as to assess state performance on those standards are collected via the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS). An analysis by the HHS Office of the Inspector General found that the federal \"guidance on reporting AFCARS data supports states beliefs that the lack of clear definitions leads to inconsistent reporting. States believed AFCARS data elements were not clearly and consistently defined and expressed concerns about foster care placement definitions, which potentially affect child welfare performance measures. In addition, differences in states' methods of reporting dates of discharge and juvenile justice populations may further inhibit uniform performance measures.\" The March 2003 Inspector General report recommended that HHS provide more precise definitions for data elements, increase accessibility of technical assistance on data collection, and other provisions.

Although the department worked closely with each state to ensure that the data used to measure the state against the standards were the best possible data available, some find this troubling. Supporters of the policy to use statewide data measured against a national standard, however, argue that no data system is perfect, that improved data collection is a by-product of using the data (or, in essence that you have to start somewhere, sometime), and that the CFSR assessed state performance in multiple ways (using both qualitative and quantitative data) so that no state could be judged on all of the measures purely by quantitative data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What is measured versus what is meant to be measured", "paragraphs": ["Researchers have taken particular issue with three of the data indicators that are used in the national standards.

While researchers generally applaud the intent of these measures\u2014that is the effort to use quantitative data to determine how quickly and effectively states re-establish a permanent home for children who come into care\u2014they argue that some of the measures used in the initial round of reviews might penalize a state even if its performance was improving."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Timely adoption and timely reunification", "paragraphs": ["The national standards for both of these measures look at only children who exit foster care in a given year.

Some researchers have argued that the focus exclusively on children who exit foster care means that the overall likelihood of a child being adopted or reunited is not being measured\u2014i.e. the measure does not look at all children who have been in care during the year but only those who exit that care. Further, in the case of adoption, they note that if a state did the hard work of moving many of its longer-staying and likely more difficult to place children into adoptive homes, even if it held steady or improved the rate at which newer entrants moved to adoption, it might perform badly on the official measure.\u00a0That is the longer staying children moved to adoption\u2014and who presumably were a legacy of older agency practice\u2014would necessarily reduce the share of children adopted within two years.", "Rather than looking at children who exit foster care, one alternative measure of time to reunification or adoption might follow the group of children (or \"cohort\" in researcher lingo) who entered foster care in a given year to determine how many were adopted within two years or reunited within one year. This kind of measure however would require the administrative data to follow a single child's records across more than one fiscal year (i.e., it requires longitudinal data) and AFCARS is currently not set up to enable this kind of analysis. Another alternative might group certain measures together. For instance, with regard to timely adoption, in addition to recording the share of children who exited foster care to adoption within 24 months of entering care, the measure would also look at overall likelihood of adoptions (e.g., total children served in given fiscal year divided by number of adoptions in that year)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Foster care re-entry rate", "paragraphs": ["Criticism of the national standard that looks at the foster care re-entry rate focuses on the fact that changes in a state's caseload size in the given fiscal year affect state performance in this area\u2014even though those caseload changes may be unrelated to how well a state did at achieving permanency for children in the previous year.

This means that a state that experiences a decline in new entries to care may have fewer\u2014or at least no greater number of children re-entering than in previous years but its performance might nonetheless be rated as worse than the previous year. By contrast a state with an increasing number of entries to foster care might increase the number of re-entries but show no decline in its performance.
