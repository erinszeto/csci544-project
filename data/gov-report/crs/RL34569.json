Some analysts suggested that increased disease-specific funding in the foreign operations appropriations would drain available funding from other aid priorities in developing countries, such as agriculture assistance and private sector growth. Others opposed increased funding because they did not want to expand current PEPFAR activities to support additional Focus Countries and to fund activities not directly related to HIV/AIDS. Critics of high spending levels were concerned about proposals to increase the number of Focus Countries and to extend PEPFAR funds to support health care infrastructure as well as to enhance nutrition and feeding programs. For example, Senators who placed a hold on H.R. 5501 and S. 2731 had stated that the bills would \"transform a targeted and accountable $15 billion dollar AIDS program into an unaccountable, unspecified $50 billion development program.\"", "Proponents of the authorization level argued that access to HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care for all would require greater resources.

Proponents of the addition of these new Focus Countries argued that the designation would direct more HIV/AIDS funding to these areas. Debate about the Focus Countries list also centered on how authorized funds in excess of the President's $30 billion PEPFAR reauthorization proposal would be distributed across PEPFAR countries.

Supporters asserted that compacts may have been helpful in outlining expectations for broader development efforts and investments that have been shown to have a significant impact on health. Some compacts, for example, might have included an agreement that aid recipient countries would reform property laws and inheritance laws. Such reforms have been shown to reduce the vulnerability of widows and orphans to HIV infection by providing them with greater financial security. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 5501 supported this idea, stating that compacts and framework agreements were \"one mechanism to promote the transition from an emergency to a public health and development approach to HIV/AIDS\" and could be \"tailored to local circumstances to promote host government commitment to deeper integration of HIV/AIDS services into health systems, contribute to the health systems overall, and enhance sustainability.\" The language required that cost-sharing assurances from PEPFAR-recipient governments and transition strategies be included in compacts.

The Senate-passed version maintained the spending directive for OVC and modified the spending directives for treatment and care by requiring that over half of bilateral HIV/AIDS assistance be spent on treatment, care, and nutritional and food support for HIV/AIDS-infected people. It did not include the funding distribution guidelines and spending directives for HIV/AIDS prevention. Both versions required balanced funding for HIV prevention activities, stating that a report to Congress must be provided to justify any decision to spend less than 50% of prevention funds on behavioral change programs, including abstinence and be faithful activities, in any PEPFAR recipient country with a generalized epidemic.", "There was considerable debate about the effectiveness of congressional spending directives. Some observed that the spending directives limited Focus Country teams' ability to tailor budgets to local HIV transmission patterns. Critics contended that the spending directives also complicated efforts to address the specific nature of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in each country. HIV/AIDS rates among the Focus Countries ranged from 1% to over 33%. The current and proposed Focus Countries had epidemics that varied in nature and prevalance: some epidemics were concentrated among drug users or prostitutes while others were spread throughout the population. Some argued that Congress might consider eliminating some or all prevention, treatment, and care spending directives to promote operational planning that was responsive to the nature of the epidemic in each country and reflected the cost of implementation in that area.

Some suggested that one alternative to spending directives was to allow U.S. staff in PEPFAR Focus Countries to set annual program objectives for prevention, treatment, and care that, in turn, would be added up to become the five-year country prevention, treatment, and care objectives. These then would have been totaled across countries to calculate the U.S. global program objectives for these program areas. At the time of consideration of H.R. 5501 , OGAC determined five-year country prevention, treatment, and care goals for the 15 Focus Countries, and then U.S. staff in PEPFAR Focus Countries set annual program objectives with the goal of reaching five-year country goals but with consideration for the challenges of the country's HIV/AIDS epidemic.

In 2001 the U.N. General Assembly adopted the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, which stated that \"prevention must be the mainstay of our response.\" Some organizations, such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Global AIDS Prevention Working Group, focused their efforts on strategies and prevention research in an effort to \"prevent the HIV epidemic from becoming generalized in countries with emerging epidemics\" and to prevent millions of new infections.", "On the other hand, some contended that focusing on prevention and neglecting treatment and care would ignore the economic and social impacts of the disease on those already infected, on the children and families of infected persons, and on countries with high prevalence rates. Some asserted that treatment and care were investments in hope and stability, preventing children from being orphaned and people from suffering the ravages of the disease when treatment to prolong life and improve its quality is available. Some argued that treatment costs were dropping very rapidly for not only first-line treatment regimens but also second-line antiretroviral therapies, a trend that was expected to continue as treatment expanded to cover more infected people in low and middle income countries and as more international donors negotiated for lower prices.

Some also were concerned about the possible long term implications of the increased funding levels if the funds were spent on treatment and care of individuals who are infected with AIDS. One study pointed out that treatment of infected individuals is a lifelong commitment and that treatment itself prolongs that length of time; it estimated that if scale-up of treatment continued at the historical rate since FY2004 and drug prices and treatment costs remained the same, maintenance of treatment funding levels would necessitate either a 20% increase in total U.S. overseas development assistance by FY2016 or a reallocation of 20% of the current overseas development assistance budget of $23 billion to AIDS treatment funding alone. It argued this might raise questions about how funding for other global health programs and development efforts might be adversely affected.", "Supporters of language that addressed issues of coordination of U.S. global health and development programs with disease-specific initiatives like PEPFAR and PMI argued that the more comprehensive development of health infrastructure and training of health workforces in these areas would increase the effectiveness of PEPFAR and other single-disease programs and decrease the need for disease-specific efforts in the future by building local capacity to address disease and basic health.
