However, some of these same courts have expressed concerns that such theories could lead to liability for ordinary breaches of contract or insignificant regulatory violations, and have thus imposed limitations on their use by the government or private parties that sue on behalf of the government.

For example, in FY2013, the Department of Justice (DOJ) recovered about $3.8 billion in settlements and judgments under the FCA, which represents the federal government's primary civil fraud remedy. Of this amount, recoveries from procurement fraud cases accounted for a record $890 million. The government has also recovered large civil penalties and forfeitures from contractors who submit fraudulent claims for payment as part of the contract disputes process, including in a recent case in which the Federal Circuit affirmed the Court of Federal Claims' (COFC's) assessment of a $50.6 million civil penalty against a contractor under the Contract Disputes Act's (CDA's) anti-fraud provision and rendered judgment of forfeiture of a $13.3 million contractor claim under the Forfeiture of Fraudulent Claims Act (FFCA). Some federal statutory civil fraud remedies may be cumulative, raising the possibility that the government could potentially recover significant sums, particularly if it suffers damages.", "In addition to the significant damage awards that plaintiffs may recover under some of these statutes, courts may find a contractor civilly liable under these laws for conduct that may not amount to fraud under traditional common law definitions. Although many provisions in federal civil fraud statutes require the existence of a \"claim\" for payment from the government, the statutes may impose civil penalties and forfeitures even when the government has not relied on, or suffered damages from, the claim.

Generally, the Department of Justice (DOJ) may intervene in a relator's suit within a certain time period after receiving the complaint and other material information. If the DOJ intervenes, then it conducts the action. If the DOJ declines to intervene, the relator may proceed with the action. When the DOJ conducts an action initially brought by a relator, the court may award the relator between 15 to 25 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement of the claim \"depending upon the extent to which the person substantially contributed to the prosecution of the action.\" If the government declines to intervene, the relator may receive between 25 and 30 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement.

For example, in 1943, the Supreme Court expanded the reach of the act's qui tam provisions, holding that a relator's action under the FCA could be based solely on knowledge already possessed by the government and made public in a criminal indictment. Congress reversed this decision by enacting a law that stripped federal courts of jurisdiction over suits brought by relators when the government already had knowledge of the alleged fraud underlying the relator's complaint. In the same law, Congress also limited whistleblower lawsuits by reducing the share of the recovery a relator could obtain in a successful suit. ", "By contrast, decades later, Congress sought to strengthen the FCA in the wake of evidence of extensive fraud against the federal government by defense contractors and others. In 1986, Congress restored courts' jurisdiction over some qui tam suits based on publicly disclosed information, including suits in which relators were an \"original source\" of information about the alleged fraud. The amendments also relaxed the knowledge standard for liability, making clear that liability required no specific intent to defraud.", "More recently, Congress amended the FCA in response to various judicial developments that some perceived as having weakened the act. In 2009, Congress passed the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act (FERA). Among other things, FERA eliminated language suggesting that a false claim must be submitted directly to a federal officer or employee and added a specific materiality element to the act's \"false statements\" provision.

One formulation of the judicially created implied false certification theory allows the United States or a relator to establish the falsity of a claim for payment even when the claim is not explicitly false because \"the act of submitting a claim for reimbursement [or payment] itself implies compliance with governing federal rules that are a precondition to payment.\" ", "However, courts have not adopted this definition uniformly. Thus, for example, some courts do not mandate that compliance with a law or contractual provision be an express precondition of payment, requiring only that it be material to the government's decision to pay the claim. Some courts hold that a violation of a contractual provision may make a claim for payment false under the implied certification theory. In addition, a couple of courts that have recognized the theory have done so in cases in which the claimant has previously expressly certified that it would comply with a law.", "Although the government and relators have often used the implied false certification theory in an effort to establish the falsity of claims for payment by contractors, the text of the FCA does not explicitly appear to recognize the theory. Moreover, it does not appear that the Supreme Court has addressed the theory's viability. Nevertheless, federal courts of appeals in the First, Second, Third, Sixth, Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, and District of Columbia circuits have adopted this theory of falsity in some form.

In this case, a subcontractor agreed to comply with the eligibility requirements of the Small Business Administration's (SBA's) \"8(a) Program\" in order to receive a contract from the agency. Federal regulations required Ab-Tech to obtain the SBA's approval prior to entering into \"any management agreement, joint venture agreement or other agreement relative to the performance of a section 8(a) subcontract.\" The court held that by submitting payment vouchers to the government without disclosing that it had entered into a prohibited contractual arrangement with a non-minority owned business, Ab-Tech falsely and by implication certified compliance with the eligibility regulations that were critical to the government's payment decision. This, the court held, resulted in a false claim under the FCA. The court reasoned that these claims were false in part because they \"caused the Government to pay out funds in the mistaken belief that it was furthering the aims of the 8(a) program.\" ", "Examples of recent implied false certification cases in the procurement context include cases in which parties have alleged that a contractor submitted a claim for payment while failing to comply with contractual provisions (express or implied); laws; or, most commonly, requirements established by law and contract.

Some of these courts have stated that the FCA is not an \"enforcement device\" for \"minor\" violations of law or breaches of contract. In addition, at least one commentator has noted that such a requirement makes the contractor aware of which violations of law or contract may result in FCA liability, allowing contractors to focus their resources on monitoring for compliance with these requirements. Other courts that recognize the implied certification theory do not mandate that compliance be an express precondition of payment, requiring only that the law or contractual provision be material to the government's decision to pay the claim.

For example, in the D.C. Circuit, the United States or relators must show that a defendant knows \"(1) that it violated a contractual obligation, and (2) that its compliance with that obligation was material to the government's decision to pay.\" However, when the government pays a claim while possessing knowledge that a contractor has violated a law, regulation, or contractual provision, this may negate the contractor's intent to make a false claim or statement, at least when the government has directed the contractor's participation in, or consented to, the violation. In addition, some courts have found that a contractor may lack the requisite knowledge when it has made a plausible but erroneous interpretation of the contract \"absent some specific evidence of knowledge that the claim is false or of intent to deceive,\" at least when the interpretation is not unreasonable.", "Because a cause of action under the FCA alleges fraud, some courts have held that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) requires the government or relator to plead the elements of such actions with sufficient particularity in order to avoid having the actions dismissed by a court for failure to state a claim for relief.

These cases often involve conduct by contractors during the bidding or negotiation process such as collusive bidding; bid-rigging; contracts obtained based on false information, fraudulent pricing, or inflated cost estimates; or false representations about the ability to perform. Federal courts of appeals that recognize the fraud in the inducement theory of falsity include the Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth circuits.", "Courts' recognition of the theory may stem in part from concerns that the government will ultimately pay higher prices for goods and services under fraudulently induced contracts.

In that case, electrical contractors colluded to remove competition from the bidding process while certifying that their bids were genuine and not collusive. The Court wrote that", "By their conduct, the respondents thus caused the government to pay claims of the local sponsors in order that they might in turn pay respondents under contracts found to have been executed as the result of the fraudulent bidding.

Lockheed Martin Corp. , the relator alleged that Lockheed Martin knowingly underestimated its costs in order to win a cost-reimbursement contract for services related to modernizing hardware and software used for space launch operations. At the time the Air Force awarded the contract to Lockheed, it knew of the risk that costs would grow. Indeed, although Lockheed bid $432 million on the contract, the Air Force ultimately paid the company more than $900 million. Lockheed argued that it could not be held liable for making false initial cost estimates, even though Lockheed's management had allegedly told employees to lower their cost estimates without a sound basis, because these estimates amounted to statements of opinion rather than fact. The Ninth Circuit disagreed, holding that FCA liability may attach to false estimates, including \"fraudulent underbidding in which the bid is not what the defendant actually intends to charge\" when the other elements for FCA liability are satisfied.", "A few court decisions provide further insight into this theory of fraud in the inducement. Although submission of inflated bids by contractors may cause the government to spend more money than it would have in a fair and open marketplace, some courts have recognized that underbidding may result in higher costs for the government only if the contractor seeks price adjustments above the bid price. Thus, one district court has held that an intentionally undervalued bid may not render claims for payment under a fixed-price contract false under an inducement theory unless the contractor subsequently seeks adjustments beyond the bid price to which it is not entitled. This holding acknowledges that contractors may \"buy-in,\" or deliberately offer below-cost prices to get an award, hoping that it will lead to future work with a government agency.

In addition, parties have alleged that inducement occurred as a result of false representations made by the contractor about the characteristics of a product, such as its effectiveness and safety; performance of the contract; record of business ethics or lack of conflicts of interest; compliance with the preconditions of contract award; compliance with labor laws and regulations; financial health; and discounts offered to commercial customers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limitations on the Theory", "paragraphs": ["As with the implied certification theory, some courts have limited plaintiffs' use of the fraud in the inducement theory.

First, the contractor maintained that it had not made a \"claim\" under the CDA for the $64 million in total costs because it did not seek the funds as a \"matter of right\" but rather presented the number as an estimate \"to encourage the government to adjust the contract specifications.\" The Federal Circuit rejected this argument, declining to find the lower court's factual determination that Daewoo had made a \"claim\" for these costs to be clearly erroneous, in significant part because of testimony by Daewoo's project manager confirming that Daewoo had made a $64 million claim.", "Next, Daewoo argued that even if it had made a \"claim\" for the $50 million in projected costs, the claim was not fraudulent. The Federal Circuit rejected this argument as well, and, like the COFC, held that Daewoo had committed fraud. However, the appeals court reached this result for slightly different reasons than the lower court. The Federal Circuit held that Daewoo had committed fraud because the contractor's calculation of its claim for $50 million in projected costs \"assumed the government was responsible for each day of additional performance beyond the original 1080-day contract period, without even considering whether there was any contractor-caused delay or delay for which the government was not responsible.\" In addition, the appeals court noted that Daewoo did not use outside experts to calculate the amount of its claim and neglected to explain how it arrived at the claimed amount during trial. Finally, Daewoo had certified that the claim was accurate and made in good faith. In upholding the $50 million penalty under the CDA's anti-fraud provision, the Federal Circuit rejected Daewoo's arguments that the penalty violated the Eighth and Fifth amendments of the U.S. Constitution."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Other Examples", "paragraphs": ["Other examples of cases in which the government has alleged that a contractor violated the CDA's anti-fraud provision have involved a contractor's purported submission of false, inflated, or duplicative claims, including when the contractor allegedly misrepresented costs under a contract, sought payment for products that did not conform with specifications, misrepresented that it was an approved source, or misrepresented its eligibility to perform the contract."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Forfeiture of Fraudulent Claims Act", "paragraphs": ["The Forfeiture of Fraudulent Claims Act (FFCA), or \"special plea in fraud\" statute, generally allows the government to assert a counterclaim seeking forfeiture of fraudulent claims brought against it in the COFC. This penalty exists as a condition of the government's waiver of its sovereign immunity from suit. Congress enacted the FFCA as part of an 1863 law that granted new powers to the Court of Claims. The FFCA states that \"A claim against the United States shall be forfeited to the United States by any person who corruptly practices or attempts to practice any fraud against the United States in the proof, statement, establishment, or allowance thereof.\"", "In such cases the United States Court of Federal Claims shall specifically find such fraud or attempt and render judgment of forfeiture.", "Judicial interpretations have clarified the elements of the special plea in fraud, as well as its mental state requirement, burden of proof, and application. The Federal Circuit has held that the government must prove that the contractor knowingly submitted a false claim with an intent to defraud it, and thus the government does not have to show that it relied on the claim or suffered injury from it. The burden of proof for the government is \"clear and convincing evidence,\" a higher standard than preponderance of the evidence. Under the FFCA, if the court finds part of a claim under a contract to be fraudulent and submitted with the requisite mental state, the court must render judgment of forfeiture on all claims under that contract. At least one court has sought to justify such a holding on the grounds that separating the claims tainted by fraud from those untainted by fraud is impossible.", "A few significant disagreements over the proper interpretation of the FFCA have arisen over the years. For example, courts disagree about whether fraud sufficient for forfeiture may involve fraud in connection with the execution or performance of the contract in addition to fraud related to submission of a claim. The Federal Circuit appears to have recently held that the government may establish a violation of the FFCA only when the alleged fraud relates to the submission of a claim, stating that the \"neighboring provisions illustrate that the forfeiture statute is best understood as a companion requirement of claims procedure rather than a catch-all anti-fraud provision.\" Courts also disagree over whether the FFCA is subject to the general statute of limitations for claims over which the COFC has jurisdiction. ", "A few recent examples of cases in which the government has sought forfeiture of a contractor's claims because of purported fraudulent conduct include allegations that the contractor submitted \"several inconsistent explanations for its added costs\" and knowingly claimed unrecoverable lost profits; used amounts in purchase orders as actual costs in its claim when related invoices showed lower costs; and asserted that it was an approved source to obtain two purchase orders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act", "paragraphs": ["The Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act (PFCRA) provides an administrative process under which certain federal agencies may obtain civil remedies and assessments from \"persons\" who knowingly make false, fraudulent, or fictitious claims or statements to the agencies. The act's legislative history suggests that Congress intended the PFCRA to remedy the \"small-dollar cases\" of fraud that the Department of Justice (DOJ) had declined to pursue in court because of litigation costs. Thus, an agency may not use the administrative process contained in the PFCRA when the amount of money, property, or services demanded in a claim (or group of related claims) exceeds $150,000. ", "The PFCRA shares some structural similarities with the FCA. Like the FCA, it allows for the imposition of civil penalties on violators for false claims or statements, as well as an assessment on violators when the government has paid the claim. As with the FCA, liability under the PFCRA requires no specific intent to defraud, and thus a party may violate the FCA when it acts with reckless disregard of a claim or statement's truth or falsity.", "However, unlike the FCA, the PFCRA establishes a mostly administrative process for recovery of civil remedies rather than a judicial one. The PFCRA provides for agency officials to investigate and review allegations of false claims or statements and ultimately requires the approval of a certain official from DOJ for the case to be referred to an Administrative Law Judge or other hearing officer. The act provides the person alleged to be liable with notice and the opportunity for a hearing on the record. The agency must prove its allegations by a preponderance of the evidence. A decision on liability or damages by the hearing officer may be appealed to the agency head within 30 days after the hearing officer issues a written decision, and, ultimately, to federal district court within 60 days of the agency head's decision. ", "Few federal agencies use the PFCRA, according to a recent study by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The study found that from FY2006 through FY2010, five civilian agencies referred 141 cases to DOJ for approval. Of these cases, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development referred 135, or 96 percent. A 2008 report by the National Procurement Fraud Task Force recommended several reforms to the PFCRA designed to increase its use by federal agencies and its effectiveness at deterring fraud. These reforms include incentivizing agencies to use the PFCRA by increasing the act's jurisdictional cap to $500,000 and the civil penalty limit to $15,000; allowing agencies to retain recovered funds instead of depositing them into the Treasury Miscellaneous Receipts account; and simplifying the act's procedural requirements.

The Councils responded that \"[g]enuine disputes over the proper application of the civil FCA may be considered in evaluating whether the contractor knowingly failed to disclose a violation of the civil FCA.\" Commenters also argued that mandatory disclosure of violations would facilitate lawsuits against contractors by qui tam relators.

In the past, the COFC has declined to impose damages when the contractor failed to comply with the eligibility requirements of the SBA's 8(a) Program. The court stated that \"damages represent compensation for a loss or injury sustained\" and that, because the government \"got essentially what it paid for,\" the government had not suffered damages as a result of the contractor's failure to comply with the eligibility requirements.

Some Members of Congress, courts, and others have continued to debate the proper scope of liability under these civil fraud statutes. Congress may enact laws that alter the scope of these statutes and, at least with respect to the FCA, has done so many times.", "Much of the debate about the scope of fraud statutes has focused on the FCA, the federal government's primary civil fraud remedy. Two recent court-created theories have further expanded the scope of defendants' liability under the FCA \u2014a statute which the Supreme Court has characterized as imposing \"damages that are essentially punitive in nature.\" Some commentators have expressed concerns that judicial recognition of these theories could allow the government or relators to recover tort-like damages for defendants' minor breaches of contract. However, some of the courts that recognize these theories have limited their use by strictly enforcing the FCA's mental state requirement; the heightened pleading requirements for fraud allegations under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b); or some form of materiality requirement. Other recent regulatory and judicial developments may also affect contractors' potential exposure to civil liability and damages under the FCA.", "Contractors' submission of fraudulent claims during the contract disputes process poses additional challenges for the government. Federal statutory civil remedies for this type of contractor fraud exist as a condition of the government's waiver of its sovereign immunity from suit, and as a means of deterring fraud against federal agencies that lack the resources to thoroughly evaluate contractor claims that may have been submitted in an effort to extract a settlement offer from the government. Fair resolution of contract disputes by courts, including resolution of government counterclaims alleging fraud, helps ensure that contractors will continue to compete for the government's business."], "subsections": []}]}}
