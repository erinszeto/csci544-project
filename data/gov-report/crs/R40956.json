This violence is carried out by a range of actors, including government security forces, rebel groups, militias, and criminal organizations. Some abuses appear to be opportunistic, the product of a larger breakdown in the rule of law and social order that may occur amid conflict. In other cases, attacks appear to be carried out systematically by combatants as a strategic tool to intimidate and humiliate civilian populations.", "While such abuses are by no means limited to Africa, weak institutions in many African states can mean that victims have little redress. In addition to health and psychological consequences, survivors are also often shunned by their families and communities. Within Africa, the issue of sexual violence in conflict has been particularly prevalent in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where security forces, rebel organizations, militias, and other armed groups have inflicted sexual violence upon the civilian population on a massive scale. This report provides a detailed case study of DRC and an overview of the U.S. strategy to counter sexual violence there.", "The issue of sexual violence in conflict is complex, with implications for international programs and policies related to health, humanitarian relief, global women's issues, the justice sector, the security sector, and multilateral activities. Multiple U.S. government agencies and implementing partners contribute to efforts to prevent and respond to sexual violence in African conflicts, including the Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Justice, and the Department of Defense, among others. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Melanne Verveer, the Obama Administration's Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues, have taken the lead on the Administration's initiative to address the issue and have focused attention through speeches, official travel, public remarks, writings, and actions at the United Nations. Still, concerns remain among some analysts that programmatic responses to the issue have lacked coordination between donors and among implementers.", "Potential issues for Congress include the authorization and appropriation of targeted assistance programs and oversight of Administration policies and participation in multilateral activities. The 111th Congress repeatedly expressed interest in bringing attention to the issue of sexual violence in African conflicts and support for programs to address it through legislation, hearings, and other congressional actions.

Sexual violence by combatant groups in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, for example, drew widespread international attention. Moreover, conflict settings are not necessarily those in which sexual abuse is most prevalent.

Most prominent in scale are the conflicts in eastern DRC and the Darfur region of Sudan. In DRC, which will be discussed in the \" Case Study: Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) \" section below, armed groups have committed sexual atrocities on a massive scale during recurrent internal conflicts over the past two decades. ", "In Darfur, rape has reportedly been perpetrated by government and government-allied forces since 2003 amid fighting between Sudanese security forces and allied pro-government militias known as janjaweed , rebel groups, and other irregular forces. United Nations officials, advocacy groups, news reports, and witness accounts allege that sexual violence was systematically employed in Darfur during the height of the conflict (2003-2006) as a weapon of war and ethnic cleansing, part of a government counterinsurgency strategy that has orchestrated mass violence against civilians. Similar allegations were made against the Sudanese government in the context of the North-South civil war, which officially ended in January 2005. Between July 2008 and June 2010, the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) recorded 166 incidents of sexual violence directly related to clashes between the government and armed groups, or to inter-communal fighting and banditry. While few perpetrators have been traced, 73% of suspects were described as members of non-state armed groups; another 16% were identified as belonging to the Sudanese Armed Forces and police; and other survivors reported rapes by elements of Chadian armed opposition groups. According to advocacy groups, assistance for rape survivors in Darfur was \"largely eliminated\" in March 2009, when Sudan expelled 13 international relief organizations operating in the region in response to the International Criminal Court arrest warrant for Sudan's president. ", "Other active conflict zones with reportedly significant levels of sexual violence include areas of the Central African Republic (CAR), Chad, eastern Ethiopia, southern Nigeria, and Somalia: ", "CAR has seen a proliferation of anti-government rebel movements\u2014some of which exercise territorial control in the north and northeast\u2014as well as community defense militias and organized criminal gangs. Sexual violence has reportedly been committed by the security forces\u2014especially the army, presidential guard, and police\u2014and non-state armed groups, as well as Chadian troops stationed within CAR and other factions. According to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, over 15% of women and girls in CAR's violence-ridden north have been victims of sexual violence. In Chad, multiple rebel groups based largely in the east are challenging the government's rule. Chadian security forces\u2014particularly the army, police, and gendarmerie\u2014have been accused of perpetrating sexual violence, along with ethnic militias, bandits, and armed groups connected to the spillover of conflict from neighboring Darfur. Rape and other forms of sexual violence are reportedly pervasive in and around Darfuri refugee camps in eastern Chad. According to United Nations figures, there has been an increase in the number of reports of sexual and gender-based violence among refugees in Chad, from 295 in 2006 to 860 in 2009. In Ethiopia, according to human rights groups, systematic rape has been a feature of the Ethiopian government's counterinsurgency campaign since 2007 against the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF), a largely ethnic Somali rebel group operating in the east. Ethiopian security forces have allegedly frequently raped women detained on accusations of aiding the ONLF. In Nigeria, state security forces deployed to the oil-producing Niger Delta region have reportedly used rape to intimidate the local population and retaliate for attacks on oil installations by militant groups. There have also been occasional reports of rape by militant groups. In Somalia, forces allied with the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and clan militias have been accused by human rights groups of perpetrating sexual violence against civilian residents and displaced populations. During Ethiopia's occupation of south-central Somalia between mid-2006 and January 2009, Ethiopian troops were also accused of sexual assault. In northeast DRC, southeast CAR, and southern Sudan, sexual violence has been carried out not only by domestic armed groups, but also by members of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), an insurgent group that originated in northern Uganda over 20 years ago. LRA fighters have reportedly raped and mutilated civilians and abducted boys and girls for sexual slavery. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Context", "paragraphs": ["Sexual violence has long been described as the \"collateral damage\" of fighting, and its prevalence in Africa is often viewed as a by-product of internal conflicts involving irregular forces, which frequently result in disproportionate civilian casualties. However, sexual violence is also often deployed strategically by combatant groups. Sexual violence in conflict settings may be employed as a \"benefit\" for victorious troops and commanders; a means of initiation and social bonding between combatants; a punishment meted out to civilians associated with opposing groups; a means of humiliating male members of an opposing community; a method of destroying communities and cultures associated with opponents; and a means of ethnic cleansing by impregnating women or forcing their displacement. In such cases, sexual violence is often portrayed as a \"weapon\" or \"tool of war.\" ", "The incidence of sexual violence nevertheless varies significantly between conflicts and groups. In many conflicts, sexual assault is employed by multiple combatant organizations and for different purposes; motivations may vary between units, individuals, and settings within a larger war. In Sierra Leone's 1992-2002 civil war, for example, in which the majority of conflict-affected women and girls were reportedly subjected to rape, a study found that combatants inflicted sexual violence on civilian populations both amid the anarchy of fighting and as a tool of political intimidation. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Opportunistic Violence", "paragraphs": ["In conflict settings, sexual violence often occurs amid\u2014and reinforces\u2014a general breakdown in the rule of law, social systems, and discipline within combatant groups. Sexual violence may be more or less opportunistic and indiscriminate, as combatants experience a sense of impunity for their actions. Indeed, rape in African conflict settings has frequently been associated with combatant groups that lack an effective chain of command or disciplinary mechanisms, for example in CAR, Chad, and DRC. Furthermore, women in conflict zones, due to their relative lack of economic resources, may be particularly vulnerable to exploitation in order to meet material needs. Situations in which sexual violence is widely perpetrated by combatant groups often see a concurrent increase in sexual assault by civilians, due to the same breakdown in social order as well as the normalization of sexual violence within conflict-affected communities.", "Rape and other forms of sexual assault may also be encouraged by commanders in the field as a way of placating or \"paying\" their troops. Even without active encouragement, combatants who do not regularly receive wages may view rape\u2014like the looting of food and other goods from local populations\u2014as \"justified\" as part of their upkeep. Similar dynamics also sometimes lead to the abduction of women and children as sexual slaves, a practice in which LRA fighters have reportedly frequently engaged, for example. Describing the high incidence of looting during Liberia's civil war, one account noted, \"to judge from the frequency with which male fighters committed rape or abducted women as concubines and servants, women were also included in the category of consumer items ripe for plunder.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sexual Violence as a Strategic Tool", "paragraphs": ["In addition to opportunism, sexual violence may be \"systematically employed for a variety of purposes, including intimidation, humiliation, political terror, extracting information, rewarding soldiers, and 'ethnic cleansing.'\" Indeed, in 2008, U.N. Security Council Resolution 1820 affirmed that the widespread and/or systematic perpetration of sexual violence can constitute a war crime, a crime against humanity, or a constitutive act of genocide. In several ongoing conflicts in Africa, notably those in DRC, Darfur, and Ethiopia's Ogaden region, sexual violence has reportedly been used by one or more conflict parties as a tool of war. ", "For example, in DRC, both the military and non-state combatants have reportedly employed sexual assault as a strategy to destroy or humiliate civilians perceived as sympathizing with their opponents. In the Ogaden, the Ethiopian military has been accused of raping women accused of supporting anti-government insurgents. Sexual violence is also sometimes carried out as \"revenge\" for an armed assault carried out by opposing forces; instances of this have been reported in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria as well as in the other conflicts cited. By terrorizing or incapacitating women in rural areas, in particular, combatants may also seek to deprive communities of food security and nutrition, as women are often responsible for food gathering and cultivation. In some African conflicts, both active and recent, sexual violence such as mutilation appears to have been carried out through methods seen as culturally and historically resonant, in order to further terrify civilians and potential enemies. ", "As a tool of ethnic cleansing or genocide, sexual violence may be used to spread terror among a particular targeted group, disrupt its social structures, drive the group off its land, or preclude its members from reproducing; sexual violence also sometimes precedes murder. In several African conflicts, women have been made vulnerable by being portrayed as \"symbolic bearers of their cultural or ethnic identity, and as producers of future generations.\" Sudanese security forces and pro-government militia have repeatedly been accused of employing sexual violence as a tactic of ethnic cleansing in Darfur, eastern Chad, and previously in South Sudan. In Rwanda, systematic rape was a feature of the 1994 genocide, fueled by long-standing propaganda efforts to paint Tutsi women as \"enemies of the state\"; sexual violence by pro-government and Hutu nationalist forces was later found to be \"a step in the process of deconstruction of the Tutsi group\" by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. In these and other conflicts, sexual violence has been interpreted as \"a step in the process of group destruction.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Humanitarian and Post-Conflict Settings", "paragraphs": ["While sexual violence is often most prevalent where active combat is taking place, it can also spike in and near camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees. This may be because displaced women and girls are particularly vulnerable: they are often unaccompanied by male relatives or community members, and protection en route to or within camps may be limited. Displaced women and children are also often potential victims of human trafficking; this has reportedly been the case, for example, in Somalia. Moreover, displaced populations, such as Darfuris in eastern Chad, often rely on women and children foraging for firewood or other fuel, which can put them at risk of assault by nearby armed groups. ", "Countries transitioning from conflicts in which sexual violence was prevalent also often continue to experience high levels of sexual violence. This could be due to shifts in social norms and the weakening of rule of law during conflict, as well as the reintegration of former combatants into society. High levels of sexual violence are reported in post-conflict settings in Burundi, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, for example.

In Kenya, sexual violence\u2014including rape, gang rape, and mutilation\u2014was a feature of the violence that erupted in early 2008 following disputed presidential elections. Subsequent investigations suggest that the violence in Kenya was carried out by members of the government security forces as well as militias, humanitarian workers, and other individuals, often on the basis of perceived ethnic or political affiliation, but also opportunistically.

Access to treatment and follow-up care is particularly challenging in African conflict settings, where facilities and trained staff are often insufficient, located in places that are difficult for rural inhabitants to reach, or under threat from combatants. ", "The lingering health and reproductive effects of sexual assault can contribute to, and entrench, victims' social isolation. Researchers and advocates have reported extensively on family rejections of, and societal stigma against, rape victims in African conflict settings. Survivors of sexual violence are often shunned by spouses, their families, and their communities, as are the children born to women who have been raped. Survivors often fear reprisals by the perpetrators of abuse, who are rarely prosecuted. Individuals who attempt to report assaults may also face reprisals from law enforcement or military forces; in some countries, a woman who has been sexually assaulted can be prosecuted for adultery. In addition, societal upheaval and impunity for perpetrators may reinforce norms in which rape and other forms of sexual abuse are tolerated. ", "Reports by humanitarian organizations suggest that male victims of sexual violence face particular challenges. While men and boys are thought to make up a minority of sexual violence victims in African conflicts, in some cases they have nonetheless been targeted for rape, sexual torture, sexual slavery, sexual humiliation, and forced incest. Just as in cases affecting women, societal stigma and legal impediments can act as barriers to assistance and treatment; indeed, male victims may be even less likely to report sexual abuse than women.

The difficulty of accessing assistance\u2014both emergency and long-term care\u2014is further exacerbated in conflict zones, where pre-existing health structures may have been uprooted, while humanitarian organizations' ability to operate may be threatened by logistical difficulties, threats from combatant groups, and generalized insecurity. Women and girls may also hesitate to seek care for sexual violence due to stigma; health clinics may not guarantee safety or confidentiality, further reducing the likelihood that victims will seek care.

In addition, advocates contend that many African countries lack sufficient domestic legal frameworks for the prosecution of sexual violence. Rape may not be codified as a crime, and victims may have difficulty accessing the justice system; instead, sexual violence is often seen as the domain of traditional or religious justice mechanisms. Some countries do not include male victims in their legal definitions of sexual violence. In several states, laws concerning sexual violence are framed so as to be unfavorable to the victim. For example, with regard to Darfur, according to Physicians for Human Rights, ", "Sudan's laws concerning rape effectively prevent access to justice for rape victims. The law as written defines rape as the Shari'a crime of adultery ( zina )\u2026. If a woman who claims she was raped is unable to prove that she did not consent to intercourse, she may be charged with the crime of zina , which entails corporal punishment, because she has confessed to sexual penetration outside of marriage. In addition to these serious evidentiary hurdles, members of the military, security services, police, and border guards enjoy broad immunity for their actions and permission to file a legal complaint against an alleged rapist in any of these categories must be granted by the individual's superior officer. Janjaweed [pro-government Arab militias] are integrated into the Popular Defense Forces, which is also exempt from prosecution.", "While some African governments, under pressure from donors and local civil society groups, have recently passed new legislation specifically addressing sexual violence\u2014such as Kenya, Liberia, and DRC in 2006, and Sierra Leone in 2007\u2014prosecutions are rare even in countries with appropriate laws in place. In many countries, there are multiple sources of law and legal interpretation, including the formal judicial system; religious laws; and traditional justice mechanisms. Shortfalls in law enforcement and judicial capacity also represent significant hurdles. Many African law enforcement systems lack sufficient financial resources for investigations, judicial personnel with sufficient legal training, access to and knowledge of existing legislation, and expertise in handling sexual violence cases. Obtaining medical documentation of rape is challenging in many African countries, where healthcare systems are often severely overstretched, particularly in conflict-affected areas.

The ICTR has prosecuted over 60 suspects on charges of sexual violence committed during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. The first suspect to be prosecuted for sexual violence before the ICTR was a former mayor, Jean Paul Akayesu, who was tried in 1997 on accusations that he failed to prevent sexual violence against displaced women who had sought refuge in the commune over which he held authority, among other charges. The Akayesu prosecution, now considered to be a landmark case in international law, was amended to include sexual violence following efforts by advocacy groups to publicize the systematic perpetration of rape during the genocide. Crimes of sexual violence have also been a component of all but one SCSL prosecution, including the cases against leaders of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) junta, against the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebel group, and against former Liberian President Charles Taylor, who is being tried on charges linking him to crimes committed by the RUF.

In addition, DCHA has funded an International Rescue Committee program promoting a coordinated strategy aimed at protecting displaced women displaced by conflict or disasters from sexual violence by addressing their need for cooking and heating fuel. Separately, anti-trafficking programs have, in some cases, focused on African conflict settings. At least one program, overseen by PRM, aims to assist the victims of trafficking amid conflict in an African country; the program provides protection, return, and reintegration assistance to Congolese IDPs who were the trafficked by Ugandan military forces stationed within DRC during the 1998-2003 civil war.", "Content on sexual and gender-based violence is also a component of U.S. foreign police, judicial, and military training programs, in accordance with congressional directives contained in annual appropriations legislation.
