Among those interests are the increasing importance of Africa's natural resources, particularly energy resources, and mounting concern over violent extremist activities and other potential threats posed by under-governed spaces, such as maritime piracy and illicit trafficking. In addition, there is ongoing concern for Africa's many humanitarian crises, armed conflicts, and more general challenges, such as the devastating effect of HIV/AIDS. In 2006, Congress authorized a feasibility study on the creation of a new command for Africa to consolidate current operations and activities on the continent under one commander. Congress has closely monitored the command since its establishment.", "On February 6, 2007, the Bush Administration announced the creation of a new unified combatant command, U.S. Africa Command or AFRICOM, to promote U.S. national security objectives in Africa and its surrounding waters. Prior to AFRICOM's establishment, U.S. military involvement on the continent was divided among three commands: U.S. European Command (EUCOM), U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), and U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM). The command's area of responsibility (AOR) includes all African countries except Egypt. AFRICOM was officially launched as a sub-unified command under EUCOM on October 1, 2007, and became a stand-alone command on October 1, 2008.", "DOD signaled its intention to locate AFRICOM's headquarters on the continent early in the planning process, but such a move is unlikely to take place for several years, if at all. The command will operate from Stuttgart, Germany, for the foreseeable future. DOD has stressed that there are no plans to have a significant troop presence on the continent. The East African country of Djibouti, home to the Combined Joint Task Force\u2013Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) at Camp Lemonnier, provides the U.S. military's only enduring infrastructure in Africa.", "As envisioned by the Department of Defense (DOD), AFRICOM aims to promote U.S. strategic objectives and protect U.S. interests in the region by working with African states and regional organizations to help strengthen their defense capabilities so that they are better able to contribute to regional stability and security. AFRICOM also has a mandate to conduct military operations, if so directed by national command authorities. In March 2011, for example, AFRICOM commenced Operation Odyssey Dawn to protect civilians in Libya as part of multinational military operations authorized by the U.N. Security Council under Resolution 1973.", "The 1998 bombing of U.S. embassies in East Africa and more recent attacks have highlighted the threat of terrorism to U.S. interests on the continent. Political instability and civil wars have created vast under-governed spaces, areas in which some experts allege that terrorist groups may train and operate. The upsurge in piracy in the waters off the Horn of Africa has been directly attributed to ongoing instability in Somalia. Instability also heightens human suffering and retards economic development, which may in turn threaten U.S. economic interests. Africa's exports of crude oil to the United States are now roughly equal to those of the Middle East, further emphasizing the continent's strategic importance. This report provides a broad overview of U.S. strategic interests in Africa and the role of U.S. military efforts on the continent as they pertain to the creation of AFRICOM.

Bush formally announced the creation of a new Unified Combatant Command for the African continent, reflecting Africa's increasing strategic importance to the United States. The Department of Defense (DOD) organizes its command structure by dividing its activities among joint military commands based either on a geographic or functional area of responsibility (AOR). With the creation of the new command, DOD now has six geographic commands and four functional commands. Previously, U.S. military involvement in Africa was divided among three geographic commands: European Command (EUCOM), Central Command (CENTCOM), and Pacific Command (PACOM). The command's area of responsibility (AOR) includes all African countries except Egypt, which remains in the AOR of CENTCOM. Africa Command (AFRICOM) was launched with initial operating capability (IOC) as a sub-unified command under EUCOM on October 1, 2007, and reached full operating capability (FOC) as a stand-alone unified command on October 1, 2008. AFRICOM's first commander, Army General William E. \"Kip\" Ward, former Deputy Commander of EUCOM, retired in 2011, transferring command authority to General Carter F. Ham, formerly Commanding General of U.S. Army Europe, on March 9.", "Although the precise wording of AFRICOM's mission statement has evolved since the command was first announced, DOD officials have broadly suggested that the command's mission is to promote U.S. strategic objectives and protect U.S. interests in the region by working with African partners to strengthen their defense capabilities so that they are better able to contribute to regional stability and security. A key aspect of this mission is its supporting role to other agencies' and departments' efforts on the continent. But like other combatant commands, AFRICOM is expected to oversee military operations, when directed, to deter aggression and respond to crises. ", "AFRICOM's first major military operation was Operation Odyssey Dawn, the U.S. contribution to a multilateral military effort to enforce a no-fly zone and protect civilians in Libya, in support of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973. Initial U.S. military operations, launched on March 19, 2011, included Tomahawk cruise missile attacks targeting Libyan command and control and air defense facilities. General Ham served as theater commander for the operation, with tactical operations coordinated by a Joint Task Force under Admiral Sam Locklear. Locklear serves jointly as Commander of U.S. Naval Forces Europe and Africa, and as Commander of Allied Joint Force Command, Naples, which has operational responsibility for NATO missions in the Mediterranean. The Commander of U.S. Air Forces Africa served as Joint Force Air Component Commander for Operation Odyssey Dawn. AFRICOM also supported the U.S. humanitarian response that commenced on March 4, through the delivery of relief supplies and the evacuation of foreign nationals fleeing the violence. NATO assumed the lead for military operations in Libya on April 1 under Operation Unified Protector. Congress continues to closely monitor developments related to the ongoing conflict in Libya.", "The Bush Administration's motivation for the creation of a new unified command for Africa evolved in part out of concerns about DOD's division of responsibility for Africa among three geographic commands, which reportedly posed coordination challenges. Although some military officials had advocated the creation of an Africa Command for over a decade, more recent crises highlighted the challenges created by \"seams\" between the commands' boundaries. One such seam was located between Sudan (then within CENTCOM's AOR), Chad and the Central African Republic (then within EUCOM's AOR), an area of periodic instability. The United States, acting both alone and a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), has provided airlift and training for African peacekeeping troops in the Darfur region of Sudan, and although CENTCOM had responsibility for Sudan, much of the airlift and training was done by EUCOM.", "Additionally, close observers say that EUCOM and CENTCOM had become overstretched by the mid 2000s, particularly given the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Commander of EUCOM, whose AOR included 92 countries prior to AFRICOM's creation, testified before Congress that", "the increasing strategic significance of Africa will continue to pose the greatest security stability challenge in the EUCOM AOR. The large ungoverned area in Africa, HIV/AIDS epidemic, corruption, weak governance, and poverty that exist throughout the continent are challenges that are key factors in the security stability issues that affect every country in Africa.", "His predecessor, General James L. Jones, who later served as President Barack Obama's National Security Advisor, pointed out in 2006 that EUCOM's staff were spending more than half their time on Africa issues, up from almost none three years prior.", "AFRICOM has faced myriad challenges in its establishment, and outstanding issues remain as the command moves forward. Some of these issues have been or may be addressed by Congress. Key oversight questions relating to the command may include the following:", "What are the United States' strategic interests in Africa? How are U.S. strategic interests influencing the size and scope of the U.S. military footprint on the continent, and what effect might AFRICOM's creation have on future U.S. military operations in Africa? Is AFRICOM's mission well defined? The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) addresses steps the U.S. military will take in order to improve potential \"contingency response.\" How has AFRICOM prepared to meet potential contingencies on the continent? How are AFRICOM and U.S. military efforts in Africa perceived by Africans and by other foreign countries, including China? Have those perceptions evolved since the command was first announced? What are the costs associated with AFRICOM? How are these costs affected by AFRICOM's chosen headquarters location? How closely do the State Department and DOD coordinate on plans for the command and on U.S. military efforts in Africa in general? What are the Obama Administration's views on the development of AFRICOM's interagency process? Has AFRICOM's enhanced integration of non-DOD USG agency personnel proven effective in supporting the command's mission? How is AFRICOM addressing the intelligence community's need to realign its resources directed toward the continent? What are AFRICOM's current intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) needs? How is the Obama Administration ensuring that U.S. military efforts in Africa do not overshadow or contradict U.S. diplomatic and development objectives? Should conflict prevention activities be an essential part of DOD's mandate, and are they sustainable? What are the authorities granted to U.S. Chiefs of Mission regarding combatant command activities in the countries to which they are posted, and are these authorities sufficient? How prominent are counterterrorism operations and programs, particularly relative to the peacekeeping training and support components, in AFRICOM's mandate? Would some DOD-implemented counterterrorism programs be more appropriately implemented by other U.S. agencies? How do AFRICOM's civil affairs teams contribute to the command's mission? Are the legal authorities guiding DOD's implementation of security cooperation programs sufficient for AFRICOM to fulfill its mandate? Do any of these authorities hinder the U.S. military's ability to conduct these programs? Are there procedural challenges that hinder AFRICOM's ability to conduct its capacity building mandate in a timely manner? Does the lack of assigned forces affect AFRICOM's ability to implement its mandate? How can AFRICOM ensure that improvements in partner capacity are sustained? How does DOD ensure that the training and equipment provided to African forces are not used to suppress internal dissent or threaten other nations?", "This report provides information on AFRICOM's mission, structure, interagency coordination, and its basing and manpower requirements.

There are four functional commands, including Transportation (TRANSCOM), Special Operations (SOCOM), Joint Forces (JFCOM) and Strategic (STRATCOM) Commands. As mentioned above, DOD responsibilities for Africa were divided among three geographic commands prior to October 2008.

Changes to the UCP are usually initiated by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), who presents a recommendation to the Secretary of Defense. After the Secretary's review, a proposal is presented to the President for approval. Prior to the advent of AFRICOM, the most recent geographic command to be established was NORTHCOM, which was created in 2002, after the September 11 terrorist attacks, to protect the U.S. homeland. The UCP is reviewed at least every two years, as required by the Goldwater-Nichols DOD Reorganization Act of 1986 ( P.L. 99-433 ). The 2006 review recommended the establishment of an Africa Command, and the 2008 review codified the command. Congress has, on occasion, taken legislative action that has led to changes in the UCP. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Combatant Command \"Plus\"?", "paragraphs": ["Some DOD officials have referred to Africa Command as a combatant command \"plus.\" This implies that the command has all the roles and responsibilities of a traditional geographic combatant command, including the ability to facilitate or lead military operations, but also includes a broader \"soft power\" mandate aimed at building a stable security environment and incorporates a larger civilian component from other U.S. government agencies to address those challenges. According to the 2002 U.S. National Security Strategy, \"America is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing ones.\" The Department of Defense, identifying instability in foreign countries as a threat to U.S. interests, issued DOD Directive 3000.05 in 2005, defining stability operations as a \"core U.S. military mission\" that \"shall be given priority comparable to combat operations.\" The 2008 National Defense Strategy further argues that \"the inability of many states to police themselves effectively or to work with their neighbors to ensure regional security represents a challenge to the international system\" and that \"if left unchecked, such instability can spread and threaten regions of interest to the United States, our allies, and friends.\" The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) reiterates these points, noting, \"preventing conflict, stabilizing crises, and building security sector capacity are essential elements of America's national security approach.\"", "Although U.S. forces have traditionally focused on \"fighting and winning wars,\" defense strategy is now evolving to look at conflict prevention, or \"Phase Zero,\" addressing threats at their inception through increased emphasis on theater security cooperation (TSC) and capacity building of allies. The 2010 QDR placed strategic importance on security assistance, an emphasis that was reiterated in the FY2011 DOD budget request: ", "U.S. security is inextricably tied to the effectiveness of our efforts to help partners and allies build their own security capacity\u2026. Although security assistance is not new, what has fundamentally changed is the role that such assistance can play in providing security in today's environment. Threats to our security in the decades to come are more likely to emanate from state weakness than from state strength. The future strategic landscape will increasingly feature challenges in the ambiguous gray area that is neither fully war nor fully peace. In such an environment, enabling our partners to respond to security challenges may reduce risk to U.S. forces and extend security to areas we cannot reach alone.", "Based on the 2010 QDR, DOD has defined three strategic goals that represent the Department's \"primary warfighting missions\": prevail in today's wars; prevent and deter conflict; and prepare for a wide range of contingencies. ", "As General Bantz Craddock noted in 2006 when he was Commander of EUCOM, Africa in recent years had posed \"the greatest security stability challenge\" to EUCOM, and \"a separate command for Africa would provide better focus and increased synergy in support of U.S. policy and engagement.\" In the view of AFRICOM's architects and proponents, if U.S. agencies, both military and civilian, are able to coordinate more efficiently and effectively both among themselves as well as with their African partners and other international actors, they might be more successful at averting more complex emergencies on the continent. The 2008 National Defense Strategy stresses the military's commitment to the concept of a new \"Jointness,\" with emphasis on developing a \"whole-of-government\" approach toward meeting national security objectives, including greater civilian participation in military operations and greater harmonization of best practices among interagency partners. The 2010 QDR repeats the need to strengthen interagency partnerships. AFRICOM's first commander, General Kip Ward, viewed the U.S. military's role in Africa as part of a \"three-pronged\" U.S. government approach, with DOD, through AFRICOM, taking the lead on security issues, but playing a supporting role to the Department of State, which conducts diplomacy, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which implements development programs. ", "AFRICOM have stressed that despite playing a greater role in development activities has been traditional among most other commands, its role remains, in relation to USAID's development and humanitarian objectives, a supporting one. Command guidance for AFRICOM's humanitarian and civic assistance activities stresses that such activities should complement, not duplicate, other U.S. government activities, and should be used to strengthen security sector relationships. AFRICOM policies also require such activities to meet both U.S. foreign policy objectives and AFRICOM theater strategic interests, and they must be approved by the Ambassador and USAID Mission Director in the host country.", "The mission of Africa Command has been most closely compared to that of Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), which is responsible for U.S. military efforts in Central and South America. SOUTHCOM's mission, as defined by DOD, is to ensure the forward defense of the United States through security cooperation, counter-narcotics operations, humanitarian assistance, and monitoring and support for human rights initiatives in the region. Like SOUTHCOM, AFRICOM supervises an array of operations that relate to U.S. strategic interests but are not combat-related, unlike EUCOM, CENTCOM and PACOM, which have traditionally been more focused on preparing for potential warfighting operations. One DOD official suggested that the U.S. government could consider the command a success \"if it keeps American troops out of Africa for the next 50 years.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "An Imbalance Between Military and Civilian Capacities?", "paragraphs": ["AFRICOM's proactive approach to deterring or averting conflict reflects an evolution in DOD strategy that has been outlined extensively in government documents, but operationalizing that broad mandate may prove difficult. As one foreign policy expert points out, \"the mission of AFRICOM will necessarily require a major break with conventional doctrinal mentalities both within the armed services themselves and between government agencies.\" One former DOD official described the mandate in the following words, \"We want to help develop a stable environment in which civil society can be built and that the quality of life for the citizenry can be improved.\" The prospect that the Department of Defense will focus less on fighting wars and more on preventing them engenders mixed feelings elsewhere in the government. While many at the State Department and USAID welcome the ability of DOD to leverage resources and to organize complex operations, there also is concern among some in those agencies that the military may overestimate its capabilities as well as its diplomatic role, or pursue activities that are not a core part of its mandate. Some argue that the highly unequal allocation of resources between the Departments of Defense, State, and USAID, hinder their ability to act as \"equal partners\" and could lead to the militarization of development and diplomacy.", "In August 2009, the State Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG) published a report assessing the capacity of the Department's Bureau of African Affairs (AF). In that report, the OIG found that cuts in State Department resources and personnel after the end of the Cold War led to a decline in management and experienced staffing at U.S. missions on the African continent. The subsequent dramatic increase in funding for HIV/AIDS programs and new development initiatives, like the Millennium Challenge Corporation, combined with an increase in funding for military programs in many African countries, left U.S. embassy personnel overwhelmed and acutely understaffed. Among the OIG's many findings, the report determined that the U.S. military \"is stepping into a void created by a lack of resources for traditional development and public diplomacy.\" The report also suggested that the creation and role of AFRICOM was \"misunderstood at best, if not resented and challenged by AF.\" Inadequate communication between the Bureau and embassies led to confusion about AFRICOM's role and the parameters of U.S. ambassadors' authority in the beginning, although the OIG found that \"there is every indication that the new Assistant Secretary and the AFRICOM Commander are working cooperatively.\" Other reports produced recently by non-governmental organizations like Refugees International mirror the OIG's findings, and, like the OIG, provide an array of recommendations for resolving what they view as an imbalance between civilian and military capacity in U.S. foreign affairs. DOD references the current disparity in capacities in the 2010 QDR, noting that:", "the lack of adequate civilian capacity has made prevailing in current conflicts significantly more challenging. Unfortunately, despite a growing awareness of the need and real efforts throughout the government to address it, adequate civilian capacity will take time and resources to develop and is unlikely to materialize in the near term.

Interagency coordination of U.S. security policy involves a variety of offices and actors in Washington, DC, and in the field. In Washington, the State Department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs (PM) serves as the primary liaison for the Department with DOD. Its counterpart at DOD is the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs (ISA). USAID created the Office of Military Affairs (OMA) within the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) in 2005 to coordinate agency policy with DOD and the State Department for humanitarian relief and post conflict reconstruction efforts. USAID's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), Operations Liaison Unit (OLU), and the geographic bureaus' missions manage the operational coordination with DOD for those activities.", "At the regional level, State's PM Bureau appoints senior officials known as Foreign Policy Advisors (POLADs) to serve as advisors to combatant commanders and other military leaders to \"provide policy support regarding the diplomatic and political aspects of the commanders' military responsibilities.\" Like the State Department, USAID places OFDA military liaison officers with combatant commands that routinely provide humanitarian and disaster relief coordination; OMA also currently has policy advisors known as Senior Development Advisors (SDAs) in several commands, including AFRICOM. ", "At the country level, DOD assigns senior defense officials/defense attach\u00e9s (SDO/DATT) to serve as military liaisons at embassies around the world. These officials serve on interagency embassy Country Teams, which are led by the U.S. ambassador in each country. Many embassies also have an Office of Security Cooperation (OSC), which reports to the ambassador and the combatant commander, to coordinate security assistance activities with the host country's defense forces. USAID OFDA deploys military liaison officers as part of a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to affected countries during humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations when there is a civil-military component involved.", "AFRICOM has sought greater interagency coordination with the State Department, USAID, and other government agencies, including a larger non-DOD civilian staff (initially proposed at as much as one quarter of the total staff), than has been traditional with other combatant commands. Those involved in the creation of AFRICOM aimed to build upon initiatives in NORTHCOM and SOUTHCOM to improve the interagency process, but a former EUCOM Commander suggested that this command could be \"the pioneer\" for a new approach that the other commands might later adopt. In the development of AFRICOM's first theater strategy and supporting campaign plan, for example, the leadership sought to involve other U.S. government agencies at the earliest stages of the planning process, an effort that DOD hopes to employ more broadly as its new planning approach. Non-DOD civilian staff positions within AFRICOM include senior leadership positions, senior advisors or liaisons (including the Foreign Policy Advisor, a Senior Development Advisor, an OFDA liaison, and a senior Treasury Department representative), and subject-matter experts embedded with the headquarters staff. AFRICOM officials report that filling interagency positions has been more challenging than first anticipated. Although lawyers from several departments have worked to facilitate the assignment of non-DOD civilians to AFRICOM, only roughly 40 have been permanently assigned.", "A senior U.S. diplomat, Ambassador Mary Carlin Yates, served as AFRICOM's first Deputy to the Commander for Civil-Military Activities (DCMA), a new post equivalent to that of a deputy commander. Yates, who had previously served as U.S. ambassador to Burundi and Ghana and more recently as the Foreign Policy Advisor to EUCOM, was the first non-DOD civilian to be integrated into the command structure of a unified command. The DCMA directs many of AFRICOM's civil-military plans and programs, as well as its various security cooperation initiatives, and is responsible for ensuring that policy development and implementation are consistent with U.S. foreign policy. Ambassador Yates left AFRICOM to become the Senior Director for Strategic Planning and Institutional Reform at the National Security Council in 2009 (she now serves as Senior Director for Africa); J. Anthony Holmes, a senior U.S. diplomat, replaced Yates as DCMA. In August 2010, Vice Admiral Charles J. Leidig, Jr. assumed the post of the DCMA's military equivalent, Deputy to the Commander for Military Operations (DCMO). The DCMO is responsible for the implementation and execution of AFRICOM's programs and operations. To maintain the military chain of command, the DCMO position will always be held by a military officer, but AFRICOM's architects envisaged that the DCMA role would continue to be held by a Senior Foreign Service Officer.

The U.S. military also has access to a number of foreign air bases and ports in Africa and has established \"bare-bones\" facilities maintained by local troops in several locations. The U.S. military used facilities in Kenya in the 1990s to support its intervention in Somalia and continues to use them today to support counter-terrorism activities.

Prior to AFRICOM's establishment, EUCOM was the only geographic combatant command with headquarters located outside of the United States. Given that the majority of countries in AFRICOM's AOR were previously under the responsibility of EUCOM, and that consequently a majority of the personnel working on Africa issues were already based in EUCOM's headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany, DOD determined that AFRICOM's headquarters would be initially located at the American base in Germany as well. In November 2008, the Secretary of Defense announced that the decision on whether to move the command would be postponed until 2012. ", "Prior to Secretary Gates' announcement of the command's establishment, there was speculation that an Africa Command might be permanently located in Europe, or in the United States, like the other commands. Some DOD officials argued that AFRICOM's headquarters should be located in Africa. Locating the headquarters within the AOR would have several benefits in terms of proximity. Flight time from Germany to Nairobi, Kenya, for example, is approximately eight hours, and flight time from Germany to Johannesburg, South Africa, is approximately 11 hours. Flight time from Washington, DC, to the African Union (AU) headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, is approximately 16-20 hours. Deploying AFRICOM's staff in close geographic proximity to their African counterparts and to U.S. diplomatic missions on the continent could enable more efficient interaction.", "Those in DOD who initially advocated locating Africa Command on the continent faced some negative reactions from Africans. There were concerns, both domestically and internationally, that moving the command to Africa might be the first step in an alleged U.S. military agenda to establish a larger footprint on the continent. DOD officials stressed early in the headquarters discussion that the location in question would be a staff headquarters rather than a troop headquarters, and suggested that they might consider a dispersed regional headquarters model, with several small locations spread across the continent to lessen the U.S. presence and burden in any one country. Some suggested that AFRICOM try to co-locate such dispersed facilities with the headquarters of the continent's regional and sub-regional organizations to link AFRICOM with the AU's nascent regional security architecture. General Ward reportedly found AFRICOM's dispersed presence among its Offices of Security Cooperation (OSCs) across the continent to be sufficient in terms of an on-continent presence. AFRICOM already has military liaison officers (LNOs) at the African Union headquarters in Ethiopia, at ECOWAS headquarters in Nigeria, at the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Center in Ghana, and at the International Peace Support Training Center in Kenya. Those posts may expand, and additional liaison offices may be attached to other regional organizations.", "The Department of Defense has developed criteria for determining the ultimate location(s) for AFRICOM in coordination with the Department of State, should a decision be made to move from Stuttgart. Several U.S. states have offered to host the command, and DOD has conducted preliminary assessments of some sites. Through regular consultations with African countries that have a security relationship with the United States, U.S. officials reportedly received offers to host the command from several governments, including, most publicly, Liberia, in 2007. Other strategic partners, such as South Africa and Algeria, expressed strong opposition to a command headquarters in Africa, possibly out of concern over a permanent foreign military presence within their borders. In some countries, there are concerns that an American military presence might embolden domestic terrorist groups. Some African governments that consider themselves to be regional hegemons may perceive a permanent American military presence, whether staffed by civilians or troops, to be a rival for political or military power in their sphere of influence.", "At the forefront of DOD considerations in determining a host country (or countries), were a decision made to move to Africa, would be providing for the safety and security of over 1,000 American personnel (and their families) who staff the command. Living standards in Africa are among the lowest in the world, and DOD would be expected to choose a politically stable location on the continent with good access to health care and schools and relatively low levels of corruption. Ease of access to regional and international transportation, along with proximity to the African Union, African regional organizations, and U.S. government hubs on the continent would also be considered. Locating U.S. soldiers permanently in a foreign country would be predicated on the host country's approval of a Status-of-Forces Agreement (SOFA), a legal document negotiated by the State Department to define the legal status of U.S. personnel and property while in that country, and a bilateral non-surrender agreement, commonly known as an Article 98 Agreement, to protect American servicemen from prosecution by the International Criminal Court.

While the number of personnel needed to staff a combatant command headquarters varies, DOD officials estimate that the average command ranges from 500 to more than 1,000 personnel (exclusive of supporting intelligence architecture). AFRICOM was authorized to have just over 1,300 headquarters staff by October 2008, including intelligence and other support requirements. Sourcing manpower to facilitate the aggressive timeline to meet full operational capacity proved difficult, according to AFRICOM officials, and less than 75% of these positions were filled by the FOC date. An estimated 270 personnel for the command were transferred from EUCOM, CENTCOM, and PACOM. AFRICOM now has roughly 1,200 staff at its headquarters, and several hundred additional staff providing intelligence support. The armed services (Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines) component headquarters each also have between 100-300 staff that support AFRICOM. In essence, the services must pay two manpower bills\u2014they must fill AFRICOM headquarters requirements and also staff the service component headquarters.

Some advised DOD to consider how AFRICOM could complement the AU's regional security structure. Former Nigerian President Umaru Yar'Adua, during his December 2007 visit to Washington, DC, commented, \"We shall partner with AFRICOM to assist not only Nigeria, but also the African continent to actualize its peace and security initiative, which is an initiative to help standby forces of brigade-size in each of the regional economic groupings within the African continent.\" Yar'Adua's statements were criticized by several Nigerian opposition parties and civil society organizations. In response, Nigeria's Minister of Foreign Affairs remarked, \"Nigeria's position on AFRICOM remains that African governments have the sovereign responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security on the continent.... President Yar'Adua's statement on the proposed AFRICOM is consistent with Nigeria's well-known position on the necessity for Africa to avail itself of opportunities for enhanced capacity for the promotion of peace and security in Africa.\" During President Bush's second official visit to Africa in February 2008, Ghana's President John Kufour announced, \"I am happy, one, for the President dispelling any notion that the United States of America is intending to build military bases on the continent of Africa. I believe the explanation the President has given should put fade to the speculation, so that the relationship between us and the United States will grow stronger and with mutual respect.\" Liberia's President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf has been vocal in her support from AFRICOM, and has offered to host its headquarters. As AFRICOM has assumed ongoing security engagement operations from EUCOM and CENTCOM and initiated new programs, its officials have stressed the need to continue strategic communications efforts to increase understanding of the command among African governments and their people. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congressional Interest and Oversight Issues", "paragraphs": ["Congress has followed the evolution of U.S. military engagement on the African continent with interest and continues to engage the Executive Branch on issues related to AFRICOM's development. Several Members of Congress expressed interest in the creation of a combatant command for Africa prior to the Bush Administration decision to establish AFRICOM. In 2006, Senator Russ Feingold introduced S.Amdt. 4527 to S. 2766 , the Senate version of the FY2007 National Defense Authorization Act (hereafter these authorization bills are referred to as NDAAs) requiring a feasibility study on establishing a new command for Africa. In December 2007, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen introduced H.Res. 897 , recognizing the strategic importance of the African continent and welcoming AFRICOM's establishment. Senator James Inhofe introduced similar legislation, S.Res. 480 , in March 2008. These resolutions also urged the Departments of Defense and State, as well as USAID, to consult with African partners to address concerns regarding the command's mandate. Multiple committees held hearings on the command during its first year. General Carter Ham delivered AFRICOM's most recent posture statement to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees in April 2011.", "Congress has addressed issues associated with the command's development in report language accompanying several authorization and appropriations bills. In the command's first year, the Senate Armed Services Committee expressed its support for AFRICOM in S.Rept. 110-77 (accompanying S. 1547 , the Senate version of the FY2008 NDAA), but raised questions regarding authorities needed to stand up and staff the command; authorities and funding mechanisms for interagency staff; location; planned staffing levels; and anticipated costs. The committee repeated its support in S.Rept. 110-335 ( accompanying the FY2009 NDAA; P.L. 110-417 ), but expressed concern that other U.S. government agencies may not have the resources to support the command's \"whole of government\" approach. ", "Congress has focused some of its attention on AFRICOM on the command's headquarters location. In 2008, the House Appropriations Committee raised concern with unanswered questions related to the headquarters location in H.Rept. 110-775 (accompanying H.R. 6599 , the House version of the FY2009 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act). The House Armed Services Committee, in H.Rept. 112-78 (accompanying H.R. 1540 , the FY2012 NDAA), has directed the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress on the conclusions of an alternative basing review for AFRICOM by April 2012, noting the committee's view that AFRICOM's location should \"provide the maximum military value to the realigned command and at the minimum cost required to implement the relocation.\" In July 2011, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison introduced S.Amdt. 562 to H.R. 2055 , the FY2012 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill, which would restrict the use of funds for a permanent AFRICOM headquarters outside the United States until the Secretary of Defense provides the congressional defense committees with an analysis of the military construction costs associated with establishing a permanent location overseas versus in the United States. DOD has used military construction funds in previous years to update the headquarters facilities currently used by AFRICOM in Stuttgart and is not currently requesting funds for further headquarters construction. ", "Several committee reports have raised questions associated with military construction in Djibouti associated with AFRICOM's Combined Joint Task Force\u2013Horn of Africa. In S.Rept. 111-35 (accompanying S. 1390 , the Senate version of the FY2010 NDAA), the Senate Armed Services Committee expressed support for the persistent regional engagement activities conducted by CJTF-HOA, but requested clarification from DOD on the future role of the Task Force on the continent. In the final version of the FY2011 NDAA ( H.R. 6523 , P.L. 111-383 ), the House Armed Services Committee required DOD to submit a report evaluating CJTF-HOA's activities to counter violent extremism on the continent and the extent to which the Task Force's activities are aligned with AFRICOM's mission. Most recently, in S.Rept. 112-29 (accompanying the Senate version of the FY2012 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill), the Senate Appropriations Committee reiterated support for maintaining a military presence in the Horn of Africa at Camp Lemonnier, given the region's strategic importance in the war against terrorism, but repeated concerns about \"the long range mission of AFRICOM at Camp Lemonnier and the planned development and security of the installation,\" as well as about the long-term funding options for CJTF-HOA.", "AFRICOM's mandate has also been considered by Congress within the broader context of DOD's role in U.S. foreign affairs. In 2008, AFRICOM was the focus of a series of hearings by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform's Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs. The command has also been discussed in hearings on foreign assistance and national security reform, on interagency cooperation, and on the concept of \"smart power.\" The House Armed Services Committee, which commissioned a Panel on Roles and Missions (of not only the various military branches, but also of the various civilian agencies involved in protecting U.S. security), found that shortcomings in the interagency process have led the military to take on missions that are not part of its core responsibilities. The FY2008 NDAA required the military to examine its core competencies, a review which may ultimately have implications for AFRICOM, as may a requirement in H.Rept. 111-288 accompanying the FY2010 NDAA for DOD to evaluate the relationship between DOD's authorities to conduct security cooperation and the Department of State's authorities for security assistance. Some observers have cautioned that AFRICOM could develop independent institutional imperatives that demand resources regardless of need, rather than reflecting genuine strategic interests.", "Given that a large part of AFRICOM's mandate is to build the indigenous capacity of African defense forces, the ease with which the command can conduct security cooperation programs will be key to its success. DOD officials suggest that inefficiencies exist in the authorities through which funding is provided for the U.S. military's security cooperation activities. Some military officials have argued that the applicable laws need simplification to allow the combatant commands greater flexibility to respond to emerging threats and opportunities. Others have raised concerns, though, that modifying the administrative authorities could interfere with the Department of State's diplomatic decisions or bilateral relationships. The National Security Council is currently conducting a Security Sector Assistance Review that may address some of these issues. The U.S. military has faced other policy restrictions in its operations with some African governments and militaries. ", "The establishment of a new unified command requires both financial and human resources, and although some have been redirected from other commands, military resources have been stretched by major theater operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, making troop readiness and costs associated with AFRICOM's development a key issue for Congress. A June 2011 DOD report on the organizational structure of combatant commands noted that AFRICOM's headquarters staffing is not currently sufficient for full-time operational capacity during an extended crisis. The report states that during Operation Odyssey Dawn in Libya, AFRICOM headquarters was augmented by 90 personnel, and additional personnel would have been required to maintain continuous operations if Odyssey Dawn had continued longer than it did. The June 2011 report also notes that the command is open to increasing State Department and USAID staffing at AFRICOM above current levels \"if, and when, these departments are able to provide additional manpower resources.\" Additional staffing of interagency personnel at AFRICOM may require additional resources from Congress. The Secretary of Defense has advocated on behalf of the civilian agencies, emphasizing that the State Department is critically understaffed.", "The development of AFRICOM's interagency staffing has been of interest to Congress. In the House Report to accompany H.R. 2082 , the Intelligence Authorization Act of FY2008, the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence expressed concern with interagency coordination on Africa, calling it \"flawed\" and suggesting that the intelligence community needed to realign its resources to \"better understand the threats emanating from this region.\" DOD officials point out that there are no legally binding requirements for agencies to coordinate their activities, which could make AFRICOM's \"pioneering\" interagency process more challenging, should other agencies not have the resources to participate adequately. Because AFRICOM's role is to support U.S. foreign policy objectives in Africa, close coordination with the State Department will be critical to its success. ", "As U.S. military activity on the continent has expanded in recent years, some observers have expressed concern with the idea that U.S. military efforts on the continent could overshadow U.S. diplomatic objectives. A 2006 Senate Foreign Affairs Committee Report found that:", "As a result of inadequate funding for civilian programs ... U.S. defense agencies are increasingly being granted authority and funding to fill perceived gaps. Such bleeding of civilian responsibilities overseas from civilian to military agencies risks weakening the Secretary of State's primacy in setting the agenda for U.S. relations with foreign countries and the Secretary of Defense's focus on war fighting.", "Former Senate Africa Subcommittee Chairman Russ Feingold, who was supportive of AFRICOM's creation, once cautioned that the command must \"contribute to, not define, the U.S. Government's overall strategy and objectives for the continent.\" Likewise, Senator Richard Lugar has suggested that AFRICOM could help the U.S. military develop a \"more sophisticated understanding of a region that is ever-changing and highly complex,\" but has also noted that, \"with greater expertise created within a new regional command, the hope is that there would be few disagreements between the two Departments on the appropriateness of security assistance to specific African nations. But undoubtedly, some differences of opinion will occur.\" As AFRICOM continues to develop, Congress may exert its oversight authority to monitor the command's operations to ensure that they support, rather than guide, U.S. political, economic, and social objectives for the continent.", "Appendix . ", "Appendix A. History of U.S. Military Involvement in Africa", "The United States maintained Wheelus Air Base in Libya from the 1940s until 1971 with some 4,000 American personnel. Wheelus served primarily as a bomber base for missions to Europe and as an Air Force training location, although U.S. forces from the base did provide emergency humanitarian assistance to earthquake and flood victims in Libya and Tunisia in the 1960s.", "Africa was not included in the U.S. military command structure until 1952, when several North African countries, including Libya, were added to the responsibilities of U.S. European Command because of their historic relationship with Europe. The rest of the continent remained outside the responsibility of any command until 1960, when Cold War concerns over Soviet influence in newly independent African countries led DOD to include Sub-Saharan Africa in the Atlantic Command (LANTCOM), leaving North Africa in EUCOM. The Unified Command Plan was revised again in 1962 by President John F. Kennedy, and responsibility for Sub-Saharan Africa was transferred to a newly-created Strike Command (STRICOM), which was responsible for operations in the Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia and located at McDill Air Force Base in Tampa, FL. STRICOM was redesignated as Readiness Command (REDCOM) in 1971, and its responsibility for Africa was dissolved, leaving Sub-Saharan Africa out of the combatant command structure until 1983. Under the Reagan Administration, U.S. military involvement in Africa was largely dominated by Cold War priorities, and the Administration's \"containment\" policy led DOD to divide responsibility for Africa into its current configuration.", "In the 1980s, the U.S. military was involved in repeated skirmishes with Libyan jets in territorial disputes over the Gulf of Sidra, and those engagements later escalated as Libya was implicated for supporting international terrorism. On April 15, 1986, the United States initiated air strikes against multiple military targets in Libya under the code name Operation El Dorado Canyon to \"inflict damage to Qadhafi's capability to direct and control the export of international terrorism;\" several civilian targets including the French Embassy in Tripoli were also inadvertently hit.", "After the end of the Cold War, U.S. policy toward Africa was driven by President George H. W. Bush's vision of a \"New World Order\" and later by President Bill Clinton's policy of \"assertive multilateralism.\" U.S. military involvement in Africa was dominated by the deployment of U.S. forces to Somalia to secure humanitarian operations, first in 1992 under the U.S.-led Unified Task Force (UNITAF), also known as Operation Restore Hope, and later under the United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) II. U.S. military efforts in Somalia were unprecedented on the continent\u2014over 25,000 U.S. soldiers were deployed by President George H.W. Bush under UNITAF, which was led by CENTCOM and included forces from 24 other countries.", "The number of U.S. troops was significantly reduced under President Clinton as operational responsibility was shifted from UNITAF to UNOSOM II. In October 1993, U.S. Special Operations soldiers in the U.S.-led Task Force Ranger engaged Somali militia forces in the battle of Mogadishu, which ultimately resulted in the deaths of 18 American soldiers and hundreds of Somalis. President Clinton ultimately ordered the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Somalia in March 1994, the same month that a limited U.S. deployment of 3,600 soldiers was dispatched to Central Africa to assist in humanitarian efforts for Rwandan refugees and to provide protection for humanitarian supplies in Rwanda.", "In 1995, DOD outlined its view of Africa in its U.S. Security Strategy for Sub-Saharan Africa, asserting that \"ultimately we see very little traditional strategic interest in Africa.\" While the U.S. military was deployed almost annually during the 1990s to conduct Non-Combatant Evacuation and Repatriation Operations (NEO) in African countries that had become politically unstable, other contingency operations involving U.S. forces in Africa in latter half of the 1990s were limited. In 1998, following the attacks on two U.S. embassies in East Africa, the United States conducted retaliatory cruise missile attacks against a pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum, Sudan, that Clinton Administration officials initially contended was producing precursors for chemical weapons for al Qaeda.", "In 2003, the United States responded to calls to intervene in Liberia's civil war by deploying a U.S. Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) off the coast of Liberia to provide assistance to the ECOWAS mission in Liberia (ECOMIL) through Joint Task Force Liberia, under the command of EUCOM. Out of an estimated 5,000 U.S. forces deployed to the area under Operation Sheltering Sky, only approximately 200 U.S. soldiers came ashore.", "More recently, U.S. military personnel have provided training and logistical support for African peacekeepers in both Sudan and Somalia and counterterrorism training to select African military units in the Sahel and East Africa. As discussed above, the U.S. Navy continues to conduct anti-piracy patrols off the coast of East Africa. According to media reports, the U.S. military also has, in recent years, engaged in air strikes against suspected terrorist targets in Somalia. AFRICOM officials have acknowledged that the command provided logistical and advisory support for a joint military operation between the armies of Uganda, the DRC, and Southern Sudan in December 2008 against the Ugandan insurgent group known as the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). The U.S. government is currently reviewing its strategy to address the LRA threat.", "In March 2011, the United States commenced military operations in Libya under Operation Odyssey Dawn, the U.S. contribution to a multilateral military effort to enforce a no-fly zone and protect civilians in Libya, in support of U.N.
