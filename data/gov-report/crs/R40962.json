The individual 2017 allowances initially increased by 3.9% from 2016, and then by another $25,000 when the House agreed to H.Res. 411.

A few scholars have also examined how Members typically spend their office allowances, analyzing spending within broader theories of representation. Individual office spending may be as varied as the districts Members represent. Factors affecting spending include the tenure or interests of the Member, levels of casework, geography, unexpected events, and even the congressional calendar.

It may not be used for personal or campaign purposes.
