For the duration of the disability, the Vice President discharges the President's powers and duties as Acting President. When the President transmits \"a written declaration to the contrary\" to the President pro tem and the Speaker, he or she resumes the powers and duties of the office. Section 3 is intended to cover either unanticipated disability, such as injury or illness, or anticipated disability, such as medical treatment. It has been activated three times under circumstances in which the President underwent general anesthesia for medical treatment. It was informally implemented by President Ronald Reagan in 1985 and was formally implemented twice by President George W. Bush, in 2002 and 2007, under similar circumstances.", "Section 4 provides for instances of contingent presidential disability. It was intended by the Twenty-Fifth Amendment's authors to provide for cases in which a President was unable or unwilling to declare a disability. In these circumstances, the section authorizes the Vice President and a majority of either the Cabinet, or such other body established by law (a presidential disability review body), acting jointly, to declare the President to be disabled. When they transmit a written message to this effect to the President pro tem and the Speaker, the Vice President immediately assumes the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.", "If the President, at a time of his choice, transmits a written message to the President pro tem and the Speaker that no disability exists, he or she resumes office. The Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet or disability review body may, however, contest this finding by a written declaration to the contrary to the aforementioned officers, delivered within four days of the President's declaration. Congress then decides the question, assembling within 48 hours if it is not in session. If Congress decides by a two-thirds vote of both houses that the President is unable to discharge the duties of the office, the Vice President continues as Acting President until the disability is resolved. If the two-thirds margin is not obtained, or if Congress is in session at the time but does not vote on the question within 21 days of receiving the requisite declaration, then the President resumes the powers and duties of the office. Similarly, if Congress is not in session at the time, and assembles as required by Section 4, but does not vote within 21 days of the day on which it is required to assemble, then the President resumes the powers and duties of the office.", "Section 4's complexity and concern about its potential for misuse have raised questions among some observers that it could be implemented for political purposes. During debate on the amendment, its authors and proponents largely rejected such claims. They insisted the section was not intended to facilitate the removal of an unpopular or failed President, in support of which they cited checks and balances incorporated in the amendment that were designed to prevent abuse of the procedure. To date, Section 4 has not been implemented.", "Two bills pending in the 115th Congress would establish a presidential disability review body as authorized by Section 4 of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment: H.R. 1987, introduced on April 6, 2017, and H.R. 2093, introduced on April 14 of the same year. H.R. 1987 has been referred to the House Committee on House Rules and the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.

It did not, however, provide any mechanism or procedure for determining presidential inability. The same clause authorized Congress to provide by law for instances of removal, death, resignation, or inability of both the President and Vice President, which it did with the Succession Act of 1792 and its subsequent revisions in 1886 and 1947. Despite several instances of incapacitating presidential illness during the 19 th and 20 th centuries, however, it was not until ratification of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment in 1967 that procedures governing inability or disability of the President were established in the Constitution.", "This report provides a description and analysis of Sections 3 and 4 of the amendment, which deal with presidential disability or inability.

By so doing, the President transfers authority of the office to the Vice President, who exercises it as Acting President until the President reclaims his authority by declaring the disability to be ended. ", "The vehicle for implementing Section 3 is described in the amendment as a written declaration, which the President \"transmits\" to the Speaker and the President pro tempore. The declaration would be delivered to the Speaker and President pro tempore and would take effect regardless of whether Congress was in session. This language arguably allows for a variety of delivery options, including physical delivery or transmission by various electronic media. The amendment's language suggests, however, that these officers must receive the declaration before it can take effect. Given this requirement, it could be argued that the Speaker and the President pro tempore might appropriately issue an official acknowledgement of the declaration, either jointly or separately.", "Section 3 can be invoked to cover either an unanticipated disability, such as a sudden injury or illness, or an anticipated disability, such as scheduled medical treatment that might leave the President less than fully aware or cognizant for some period of time. It may potentially cover other situations, such as absence from the country or a period of \"intense grief over the loss of a loved one.\" Opinion among scholars as to whether a President could invoke Section 3 to concentrate on defense in a case of impeachment remains divided.", "The amendment's authors intended Section 3 to give the President broad discretion over the duration of any anticipated disability declaration. For an anticipated event, the President can set a specific time in the declaration of disability at which the Vice President will assume the powers and duties of the office. By setting a time and date certain for Section 3 to take effect, the President can determine the exact moment at which the Vice President becomes Acting President, while also ensuring that the Vice President has adequate preparation time to assume the powers and duties as chief executive.", "The President could also issue a declaration of disability as a result of an unanticipated injury or diagnosis of serious illness. Such a contingent declaration could take effect immediately on transmission to the Speaker and the President pro tempore.", "The President also enjoys broad discretion when declaring a disability to be ended. According to scholar John D. Feerick, under Section 3, \"a President is permitted to declare himself disabled either for an indefinite or a specified period of time and to name the hour when the Vice President is to become Acting President.\" The President would be free to declare any disability ended at his sole discretion at any time, without need for consultation with, or concurrence by, the Vice President, the Cabinet, or Congress. The amendment's legislative history supports this interpretation: ", "Under the terms of Section 3, a President who voluntarily transfers his duties and powers ... may resume these powers and duties by making a written declaration of his ability to perform [them].... This will reduce the reluctance of the President to utilize the provisions of this section in the event he fears it would be difficult for him to regain his powers and duties once he has voluntarily relinquished them.", "The chief executive would remain President for the duration of any disability declaration, but the powers and duties of the office would be transferred to the Vice President.", "The question might arise as to whether the President's declaration that a disability no longer exists under Section 3 might be contested using Section 4's procedure authorizing the Vice President and the Cabinet or disability review body to dispute such a declaration. The record indicates that the amendment's authors considered the two sections to be separate, and that a President's actions under Section 3 would not in their view be subject to challenge using Section 4's authorization.", "Section 3 also affects the Vice President: the Twenty-Fifth Amendment created a new constitutional office with its provision that in the event of a declared presidential disability, the Vice President discharges the powers and duties of the office of chief executive as Acting President . During service as Acting President, however, the question might be raised whether the Vice President would lose the title of President of the Senate, and be succeeded for the duration of the declared disability by the President pro tempore. Support for this assertion could be inferred from the provisions of Article I, Section 3, clause 5 of the Constitution:", "The Senate shall chuse their other Officers, and also a President pro tempore, in the Absence of the Vice President, or when he shall exercise the Office of President of the United States.", "Under such a scenario, the President pro tempore would exercise the powers and duties as President of the Senate for the duration of the disability. The Vice President would resume both the title and duties of President of the Senate once the President declared his disability to be ended.", "Disability scholar John Feerick has questioned whether the Vice President would need to take the President's oath of office before becoming Acting President. He has suggested that \"the duty of acting as President is encompassed by his vice-presidential oath to perform his duties faithfully,\" and that assuming the office of Acting President constitutes a duty to be so performed.", "If the President were to leave office during an activation of Section 3, the Acting President would succeed to the presidency under the provisions of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment's Section 1, which provides that \"[i]n case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Section 3: Implementations to Date", "paragraphs": ["Section 3 of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment has been informally implemented once, by President Ronald Reagan in 1985, and formally implemented twice, by President George W.

The other is the case when the President, by reason of mental debility, is unable or unwilling to make any rational decision, including particularly the decision to stand aside.", "A more recent commentator on Section 4 emphasizes the constitutional gravity associated with implementing this section , noting that \"[t] he s eparation of a [P]resident of the United States from his powers and duties for any reason should be extraordinarily difficult and should not even be contemplated except under extraordinary circumstances.

Accounts of the amendment's legislative history reveal general support by Senators and Representatives active in the process, as well as by witnesses offering testimony during hearings on the proposal.

According to Professor Feerick, the following options were mentioned during debate on the amendment: Congress could designate itself; it could retain the Cabinet but enlarge or shrink it; or it could include a mix of Members of Congress and distinguished public figures. Others have suggested Justices of the Supreme Court, medical doctors, and the Surgeon General as possible members of such a body.", "In the context of the checks and balances of the legislative process, Congress has broad authority over the lifespan of a disability panel. It could establish the body as a permanent institution. Alternatively, it could require reauthorization at regular intervals\u2014for instance, specifying renewal of its mandate with each change of presidential administration. A review panel established by law during a Section 4 disability could also be limited by Congress to the duration of the disability during which it was created.

Some observers have argued that any President might be reluctant to cooperate in establishing a disability review panel while she or he is in good health. Here again, a deterrent factor might involve the \"scenarios for endless mischief ... and horror stories of what the 25 th [Amendment] might produce.\" Barring a veto override, it could be effected only with the President's approval.", "Section 4 does not place a time constraint on creation of a disability review panel. A panel could be established at any time\u2014at the beginning of a presidential administration, or in connection with a declared presidential disability. Some studies of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment considered this option, suggesting the prospective establishment of a standing review body\u2014\"standby equipment\"\u2014that would supplant the Cabinet and join with the Vice President in declaring a Section 4 presidential disability. Establishing a disability review body on a contingent basis\u2014that is, during the actual implementation of a Section 4 disability\u2014would, however, face a considerable obstacle in the timetable set by Section 4.

It could be minimal, or it could be a role of profound constitutional gravity.", "Assuming an uncontroversial activation of Section 4 followed by the President's eventual recovery and reclamation of powers and duties, the only congressional certainty would be that the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate would receive any initial declaration of disability from the Vice President and Cabinet (or disability review body) and the President's subsequent undisputed declaration that the disability was ended.", "The creation by law of a disability review body, as provided in Section 4 and discussed in detail earlier in this report, would place considerable additional responsibility on Congress. The legislative procedures necessary to establish such a body could present demands for what could involve complex action, potentially under strict time constraints. First, as discussed previously, the Constitution offers no guidance on composition of a review body: Congress would work from a blank slate should it decide to draft and consider the relevant legislation. Second, although a standing disability review body could be established prospectively under Section 4, it is also possible that Congress would decide to legislate in this area during a Section 4 disability, which would add an element of extreme urgency to such a task. ", "Finally, the most significant element of Congress's role during a Section 4 disability would be if it were called on to decide the issue during an instance in which", "the President has declared that his or her disability, as declared by the Vice President and the Cabinet or disability review body, is ended and that he or she is fit to resume the powers and duties of office; and this declaration is disputed by the Vice President and the Cabinet or disability review body.", "Under these circumstances, in the words of the amendment, \"Congress shall decide the issue ...\" The amendment further directs Congress to convene within 48 hours if it is not in session, and to vote to decide whether or not the President is still disabled within 21 days."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Section 4 Actions", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Declaring a Presidential Disability", "paragraphs": ["The first component of Section 4 is the declaration by the Vice President, acting in agreement with either a majority of Cabinet officers or a majority of the members of \"such other body as Congress may by law provide\" (the disability review body), that \"the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office....\" This constitutes a contingent, or unanticipated, implementation of the amendment, a process that could be invoked if the President were unable for any reason, or unwilling, to declare a disability.", "The vehicle for activating this component of Section 4 is the same as that for Section 3: a \"written declaration,\" which presumes a document jointly agreed to by the Vice President and his or her associates and transmitted to the Speaker and the President pro tempore. Although nothing in the amendment appears to prohibit the Cabinet or disability review body from acting independently to issue a declaration of presidential disability, such action would not be implemented without the Vice President's concurrence. It could be argued from this practical effect and the language in Section 4, which refers to the Vice President first and then the Cabinet or disability review body, that the amendment's framers intended the Vice President to take the lead in activating Section 4. Certainly, no action can be taken unless or until the Vice President issues a declaration. As with Section 3, the amendment's language arguably allows for a variety of delivery options, including physical delivery or transmission by various electronic media. It also suggests, however, that (1) these officers must receive the declaration before it can take effect; and (2) as with a declaration issued under Section 3, it would take effect immediately upon transmission to the Speaker and President pro tempore, regardless of whether Congress is in session. ", "Given the constitutional gravity of such a declaration, it could be argued that, as with Section 3, the Speaker and the President pro tempore might appropriately issue an official acknowledgement of the declaration, either jointly or separately.

First, Congress has 21 days to consider the question of the President's disability if it is in session when the Speaker and President pro tempore receive the joint declaration. If it is not in session, Congress must assemble within 48 hours, after which it then has 21 days to consider the question, a theoretical maximum of 23 days.", "If Congress determines by a two-thirds vote of the Members of both houses present and voting that \"the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office,\" the state of disability continues and \"the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President.\" If the required two-thirds majority is not obtained within the specified time period, \"the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office[,]\" presumably in most cases immediately following a failed vote in the House and Senate. The amendment does not address the question of appropriate procedures when Congress considers a disagreement on Section 4 presidential disability, but some of the elements might be discerned in the supporting congressional documents and original debate in Congress on the amendment.", "For instance, the Senate's report on the amendment emphasized that \"congressional action [on a question of presidential disability] ... should be taken under the greatest sense of urgency.\" Congress would be able to proceed in considering the question in whatever manner it chooses: \"[t]he discussion of the committee made it abundantly clear that the proceedings in the Congress ... would be pursued under rules prescribed, or to be prescribed, by the Congress itself.\" The language requiring a \"two-thirds vote of both Houses\" to confirm a finding of continued presidential disability was interpreted by the amendment's framers as meaning a two-thirds vote of Members present and voting, the same requirement as for proposal of a constitutional amendment. In addition, during debate on the amendment in the House of Representatives, Representative Richard Poff suggested that Congress had a de facto third option to its two choices of voting with the Vice President and Cabinet to confirm the disability or to agree with the President when considering a declaration\u2014it could decide to take no action at all on continuation of the disability: \"Circumstances may be such that the Congress by tacit agreement may want to uphold the President in some manner that will not amount to a public rebuke of the Vice President who is then Acting President....

According to Fielding, the group discussed implementing Section 4 of the amendment, until it was learned that the President's surgery had been successful and that his medical team predicted a full recovery.", "Presidential succession and disability scholar John D. Feerick further noted in The Twenty- Fifth Amendmen t : Its Complete History and Applications that James A. Baker (the Chief of Staff), Michael Deaver (his deputy), and Edwin Meese (counselor to the President) discussed implementing Section 4 of the amendment while they were at the hospital, during the President's surgery.

As noted above, news of the President's condition was denied by his inner circle of advisors, and the Vice President was never informed of the President's condition or briefed on pending issues, and was excluded from any role in, or information on, policy determination and decisionmaking."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1955-1957", "paragraphs": ["The attention of Congress and the nation focused to perhaps a greater extent in the 1950s on the question of presidential disability. The three illnesses suffered by President Dwight Eisenhower during his tenure in office (1953-1961) that left him hospitalized or physically disabled for varying periods while he convalesced were a major contributing factor to this attention. There was, however, a departure from official reporting practices associated with the earlier illnesses and disabilities suffered by Presidents Wilson and Roosevelt, which had been concealed from the public. In contrast, President Eisenhower and his staff decided that his illnesses should be reported through regular White House announcements that were then published in the press and reported on radio and TV. In further contrast to these earlier presidential disabilities, Vice President Richard Nixon was kept informed of the President's condition throughout his illnesses. In a change from previous Vice Presidents, he had been informed from the beginning on policy questions and given a previously unprecedented level of participation in administration policy consideration. During the President's illnesses, he was further briefed by the President's closest advisors and was authorized to discharge routine executive duties during Eisenhower's recuperation.", "During his first term, President Eisenhower suffered a heart attack while on vacation in Colorado and was hospitalized between September 24 and November 11, 1955. After a further two-month convalescence, he returned to the White House, resuming a full schedule of duties on January 16, 1956. Less than a year later, on June 9, 1956, the President underwent surgery for a partial intestinal blockage resulting from what was later diagnosed as Crohn's disease. On November 25 of the same year, he suffered a mild stroke, from which he apparently recovered in little more than a week. During his illnesses, the President arrived at an informal understanding with Vice President Nixon whereby the latter represented him at official functions and presided over Cabinet meetings. On March 3, 1958, the disability agreement was formalized when President Eisenhower released a document outlining the Vice President's role in the event of his incapacitation any time during the balance of his term:", "The President and the Vice President have agreed that the following procedures are in accord with the purposes and provisions of Article 2, Section I, of the Constitution, dealing with Presidential inability. They believe that these procedures, which are intended to apply to themselves only, are in no sense outside or contrary to the Constitution but are consistent with its present provisions and implement its clear intent.", "(1) In the event of inability the President would\u2014if possible\u2014so inform the Vice President, and the Vice President would serve as Acting President, exercising the powers and duties of the Office until the inability had ended.", "(2) In the event of an inability which would prevent the President from so communicating with the Vice President, the Vice President, after such consultation as seems to him appropriate under the circumstances, would decide upon the devolution of the powers and duties of the Office and would serve as Acting President until the inability had ended.", "(3) The President, in either event, would determine when the inability had ended and at that time would resume the full exercise of the powers and duties of the Office.", "The Eisenhower-Nixon arrangement closely prefigured Sections 3 and 4 of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment in its general order and the procedures it established. It also set a precedent for later presidencies: Presidents John F. Kennedy (1961-1963) and Lyndon B. Johnson (1963-1969) implemented similar agreements with their Vice Presidents.", "A House Judiciary Committee staff study had addressed the question of disability in 1955, even before the President's first illness. Hearings on alternative vehicles to provide for instances of presidential disability, which included a draft constitutional amendment offered by the Administration, were held in the House Judiciary Committee in 1956. The Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments convened hearings in 1958, and voted to report amendments on presidential disability in both the 85 th (S.J.Res.61) and 86 th (S.J.Res. 40) Congresses, but the full Judiciary Committee did not act on either proposal. In fact, no floor action was taken in either chamber on the question during this period. According to several accounts, congressional leadership was unwilling to go beyond committee hearings on the disability question or on the disability agreement in order to avoid the appearance of partisan interest or congressional interference in executive branch prerogatives. "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Twenty-Fifth Amendment", "paragraphs": ["Concerns about presidential disability among the general public arguably eased following the election in 1960 of John F. Kennedy. When President Eisenhower left office at 70, he was the oldest person to have served as President up to that time, while Kennedy, at 43, was the youngest elected President in the nation's history.", "The issue continued to be of interest to many in Congress, however. In 1963, Senators Estes Kefauver and Kenneth Keating introduced a resolution, S.J.Res. 35 (88 th Congress) that proposed a constitutional amendment to establish procedures in the event of presidential disability. As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments, Kefauver convened hearings on the amendment in June 1963, with the support of the Kennedy Administration. The proposal was reported favorably to the full Judiciary Committee on June 25, but Kefauver's unanticipated death on August 10 brought an end to further legislative activity."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Assassination of President Kennedy", "paragraphs": ["The situation was dramatically transformed by the assassination of President Kennedy on November 22, 1963. News of his death astonished and saddened the nation, and while the President succumbed to his wounds within an hour of being shot, the issue of disability, which had been so recently before Congress, was soon raised again: \"[s]uppose President Kennedy, following the shooting had lingered in a coma? Who could declare him unable to perform the duties of his office?\" To this, the question of succession was now also added: Vice President Johnson was sworn in as President the same day, but under the Constitution, the vice presidency would remain vacant for 14 months, until the President and Vice President to be elected were inaugurated on January 20, 1965. During that period, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate were first and second in line to succeed the President.", "Among the compelling images of the period were those of President Johnson when he appeared before a televised joint session of Congress on November 27, 1963. House Speaker John McCormack and Senate President pro tempore Carl Hayden were seated directly behind him on the dais in the House chamber. Press accounts of the period noted that McCormack was 71 years old, while Hayden was 86 and visibly frail. Against this backdrop, according to John Feerick, \"[t]he ability of both to act as President should it become necessary was seriously questioned, and it was suggested that they resign their positions so that persons more suitable in the line of succession could replace them.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative History of the Amendment", "paragraphs": ["Before the end of 1963, Senator Birch Bayh, new chairman of the Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments, introduced an amendment proposal, S.J.Res. 139 in the 88 th Congress. After amendments in the subcommittee, the measure as reported to the full Judiciary Committee incorporated provisions that were substantially identical to the amendment as it was eventually ratified. It settled the long-standing question of presidential succession, provided for the filling of vice presidential vacancies, and established provisions governing presidential disabilities substantially identical to those found in Sections 3 and 4 of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment. The Senate approved S.J.Res. 139 on September 29, 1964, but the House took no action on the proposal before the 88 th Congress adjourned sine die. Feerick attributes this at least in part to a protective reaction by House Members to questions raised about Speaker McCormack's fitness to serve as President during the 14-month period between the Kennedy assassination and the inauguration of Vice President Humphrey in January 1965. As Senator Bayh wrote, \"[a]fter the next election, there would be a Vice President, and such a legislative proposal could no longer be interpreted as an affront to the Speaker of the House, or, to a lesser extent, to Senator Hayden.\"", "The proposed amendment was introduced early in the 90 th Congress as S.J.Res. 1 by Senator Bayh, with a companion measure, introduced in the House as H.J.Res. 1, by Representative Emanuel Celler of New York, the House Judiciary Committee chairman.", "In the Senate, the measure was reported favorably by the Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments on February 1, 1965, and by the full Judiciary Committee on February 10. The primary focus of debate on the Senate floor concerned Section 4, particularly the procedures for resolving presidential disability disputes. Some Senators questioned the wisdom of including such a level of detail within the amendment, preferring that Congress be authorized to provide these arrangements by statute. Supporters of the Bayh proposal as reported prevailed, however, and the resolution was adopted by the Senate on February 19, with only minor technical amendments.", "The House of Representatives began consideration of H.J.Res. 1 with hearings before the full Judiciary Committee in early 1965. Here, again, debate centered on procedures by which a President could be declared to be disabled, and on subsequent disputes that might arise as to whether\u2014and when\u2014the period of disability was over. The committee reported its version, which incorporated changes indicated by these concerns, on March 24. The full House passed its own amended version of the proposal April 13, by a vote of 368 to 29, voting to substitute it for the Senate resolution. Conferees required two months to resolve differences between the competing amendments before the House approved the conference report by a voice vote on June 30, with which the Senate concurred on July 6 by a vote of 68 to 5.", "The proposed amendment was circulated to the states on July 7, 1965. Although it enjoyed widespread support, most state legislatures were not able to begin ratification proceedings immediately, since many had adjourned for the year by the time the proposal was transmitted. Ratification by the necessary 38 states (three-fourths, as provided by the Constitution) required 19 months, and was completed on February 10, 1967, at which time the Twenty-Fifth Amendment became an operative part of the Constitution."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["The provisions of Article II, Section 1, clause 6 of the Constitution created uncertainties concerning aspects of (1) presidential succession, (2) vacancies in the vice presidency, and (3) presidential disability that remained unresolved from the time government under the Constitution was established in 1789 until ratification of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment in 1967.", "The Twenty-Fifth Amendment benefited from the alignment of factors that are shared by amendments that have met the stringent requirements imposed by Article V of the Constitution. Most successful constitutional amendments have emerged as responses to the stimulus of sudden transformative events, or have benefited from the \"ripeness\" of an idea that has been before the public for many years. Both factors contributed to the successful proposal and ratification of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment. A decade of congressional investigation of the issue of presidential disability, combined with the shock President Kennedy's assassination, provided a galvanizing impetus to congressional action on issues\u2014presidential succession and disability\u2014that had been discussed and debated for decades. A final element was the committed approval and active leadership support from senior Members of both chambers, including House Judiciary Committee Chairman Emanuel Celler and Senator Birch Bayh, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments.", "Of the amendment's two sections concerned with presidential disability, Section 3 has been explicitly implemented twice since ratification, during the George W. Bush presidency, and implicitly once, during the Ronald Reagan presidency. On all three occasions, the President implemented and rescinded declarations of disability in connection with routine medical procedures that presented no complications and generated little comment. To date, it has arguably met its framers' expectations with little controversy or criticism.", "Section 4's comparative complexity, particularly its potential for declaring a President to be disabled without his or her concurrence, has troubled some observers. The section, they have argued, provides opportunities for political mischief and the potential usurpation of the President's authority. It might be further suggested that Section 4, like the impeachment process, is a procedure so powerful and fraught with constitutional and political implications that it would likely be used only in the most compelling circumstances, since its invocation might arguably precipitate a constitutional crisis. In response to these concerns, however, it may be noted from the record that Senator Bayh and the framers of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment gave these issues serious consideration and included powerful checks to deter abuse. These include the President's ability to challenge a Section 4 declaration of disability; the requirement of a timely decision by Congress; and, ultimately, the need for a two-thirds vote in both houses to sustain a contested Section 4 finding of disability by the Vice President and the Cabinet or disability review body. As one commentator quoted earlier in this report concluded, \"[b]ecause the Amendment deals with unpredictable human frailties, it is not a perfect solution, but few exist in constitutional history. The task is to make the most of what the Amendment encompasses. Success depends on the good judgment and good sense of our leaders and the citizenry.\""], "subsections": []}]}}
