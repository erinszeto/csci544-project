CBO estimated that a temporary reduction of payroll taxes would raise output cumulatively in the next two years by $0.10 to $0.90 per dollar of total budgetary cost and would increase employment by between one and nine jobs per million dollars of budgetary cost.

High-income taxpayers would receive a maximum benefit of $2,202 under a one-year, two percentage point payroll tax rate reduction. As a larger share of income is earned above the wage cap, benefits from the payroll tax rate reduction would be diminished. If, however, high-income earners were more likely to save payroll tax rate reduction benefits, rather than spend these benefits, recapturing these benefits through a high-income surtax would be less likely to dampen the stimulative impact of the payroll tax rate reduction.
