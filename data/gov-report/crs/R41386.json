Before the 1862 legislation was enacted, soldiers were buried in family-selected private cemeteries, military post cemeteries, or at the sites of their deaths. The first 14 national cemeteries were established in 1862.", "After the Civil War ended in 1865, the Army Quartermaster Department began the Federal Reburial Program to \"search for, recover, and identify the remains of all Union soldiers.\" Despite extensive efforts, many of the dead soldiers could not be located, and the identities of nearly half of those recovered and reburied were unknown. By 1870, approximately 300,000 Union soldiers were recovered and buried in 73 national cemeteries, most of which were located in the southeastern United States near Civil War battlefields and campgrounds.", "The National Cemetery Act of 1867, enacted on February 22, 1867, was the first major piece of legislation to provide funds and directives to national cemeteries. A number of amendments to the National Cemetery Act of 1867 were passed in the 1870s. On March 3, 1873, Congress passed an amendment that expanded eligibility and permitted \"the interment of honorably discharged Soldiers, Sailors, and Marines\" in national cemeteries.

The feeling spread throughout the country and eventually to Washington, DC. As a result, 264 Confederate soldiers were \"re-interred into a newly created 'Confederate section' at Arlington National Cemetery in 1901.\"", "The 1930s proved to be a time of great change in operations for national cemeteries. Congress established the Veterans Administration (VA) in 1930 and made it responsible for the National Homes for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers (NHDVS), later referred to as the National Homes for Disabled Veterans, and the 21 cemeteries located on these properties. On July 10, 1933, Section 2 of Executive Order No. 6166 transferred 11 national cemeteries \"from custody of the War Department and Army to the National Park Service (NPS) under the Department of the Interior (DOI).\" In 1934, eight World War I cemeteries established abroad were transferred to the custody of the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC).", "The next three decades were marked primarily by legislation that extended burial eligibility to certain categories of individuals who were not previously eligible to be buried in national cemeteries. In 1967, however, President Lyndon Johnson directed the VA to conduct a survey of veteran and Army national cemetery programs. The VA submitted its report on March 18, 1968, Congress later passed the National Cemeteries Act of 1973 ( P.L. 93-43 ), which authorized the transfer of 82 national cemeteries and the procurement of government headstones and markers from the Department of the Army to the Veterans Administration. The Army, however, maintained control and responsibility for Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, VA, and The U.S. Soldiers' and Sailors' Home National Cemetery in Washington, DC.", "When the official transfer took place on September 1, 1973, the VA elevated its 21 NHDVS cemeteries to the status of national cemeteries. Combined, the newly structured system consisted of 103 cemeteries. The 1973 act also permanently established the Advisory Committee on Cemeteries and Memorials. Under the VA, the National Cemetery System (NCS), in its first decade of operation, experienced the largest acreage expansion since the Civil War. Thirteen new national cemeteries were established during the 1970s and 1980s. In 1986, Congress passed the Veteran's Benefits Improvement and Health Care Authorization Act of 1986 ( P.L. 99-576 ), which ordered the VA to identify the U.S. areas that were in the greatest need of veteran burial grounds.", "On November 11, 1998, President Bill Clinton signed the Veterans Programs Enhancement Act of 1998 ( P.L. 105-368 ).

In 1999, the Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act ( P.L. 106-117 ) required the VA to study future burial needs and mandated the creation of six new national cemeteries in the areas where they were most needed.

In addition, the VA has begun an \"urban initiative\" to establish a secondary columbaria, crypt, or mausoleum facility to provide additional burial options for high-density urban areas with a national cemetery. Building a new national cemetery is a six-step process: (1) site selection; (2) environmental assessment; (3) land acquisition; (4) master planning and design development; (5) construction documents preparation; and (6) construction award and completion.", "The VA has also established a Rural Initiative to provide additional options for veterans in rural areas. Under the initiative, the VA will build National Veterans Burial Grounds within existing public or private cemeteries in rural areas where the unserved veteran population is 25,000 or less within a 75-mile radius. A National Veterans Burial Ground is a small, VA-managed section of three to five acres within an existing public or private cemetery. VA will provide a full range of burial options and control the operation and maintenance of these lots. These sections will be held to the same \"national shrine\" standards as VA-run national cemeteries.", "In addition to establishing national cemeteries, the VA assists in establishing state veterans cemeteries. The State Cemetery Grant Program established in 1978 provides burial funds for states, federally recognized tribal governments, or U.S. territories where national cemeteries do not meet veterans' burial needs. The VA can fund up to 100% of the development cost for the purpose of \"establishing, expanding, or improving Veterans cemeteries.\" Cemeteries established under the program must operate according to the rules, regulations, and guidelines of the NCA.", "Under the Veterans' Benefits Improvement and Health-Care Authorization Act of 1986 ( P.L. 99-576 ), and more recently the Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act ( P.L. 106-117 ), Congress required the NCA to submit reports on the current and future need for national cemeteries. The reports are primarily logistical recommendations on how best to reach their established goal of servicing 90% of veterans in need of burial services.", "To date, the VA has released four such reports. The 1987 and 1994 reports both identified 10 areas around the United States that were in the greatest need of veteran burial space and recommended against \"NCS acquisition of state veterans' cemeteries \u2026 noting that the states were particularly useful in providing services in less populous areas.\" The 1994 report also recommended continuing the expansion of existing cemeteries, stating that expansion is \"a viable alternative to opening new cemeteries.\" As a result of the reports, seven new cemeteries were established and a number of existing cemeteries were expanded.", "The 2001 report submitted to Congress concluded that the establishment and first-year operation costs for a national cemetery range \"between $16 million and $25 million.\" The report also made the following major recommendations: \"Continue to encourage grant program cemeteries; Continue to examine ways to expand the service life of existing cemeteries; Build new national cemeteries at or near the locations recommended \u2026 in combination with the previous options.\"", "According to the most recent 2008 report, \"No location in the U.S. will meet the criteria for the establishment of a new national cemetery under the current service area standard (i.e., 75-miles, 170,000 veterans) until 2015.\" At that time, the only community that met the qualifying population threshold of 170,000 was the St. Louis, MO, metropolitan area because of the planned closing of Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery around 2017. The report recommends retaining the 75-mile service area standard, but reducing the veteran population threshold from 170,000 to 110,000 to increase the number of unserved communities that could qualify for a new national cemetery. This change would allow two unserved communities to qualify for new national cemeteries: Charleston, WV, and Schuyler, NE.", "The Veterans' Benefits Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-275 ) required the Secretary to report, within one year, on the site selection, schedule for establishment, and required funding for establishment of new cemeteries in five areas: (1) in Southern Colorado; (2) near Melbourne, FL, and Daytona, FL; (3) near Omaha, NE; (4) near Buffalo, NY, and Rochester, NY; and (5) near Tallahassee, FL.
