The move came less than six months after Secretary of State Clinton announced in Jakarta that the Obama Administration would launch its formal interagency process to pursue accession. This report analyzes the legal and diplomatic issues involved with accession to the TAC.", "ASEAN is Southeast Asia's primary multilateral organization. Its 10 member-nations include over 500 million people. Collectively, ASEAN is one of the United States' largest trading partners, constituting about 5%-6% of total U.S. trade. Geographically, Southeast Asia includes some of the world's most critical sea lanes, including the Straits of Malacca, through which pass a large percentage of the world's trade. The TAC was first negotiated in 1976 and subsequently amended to allow non-regional countries to accede. Fifteen countries have done so, including U.S. allies Japan, South Korea, and Australia, as well as China, Russia, and India.", "Within ASEAN, accession to the TAC by non-members often is seen as a symbol of commitment to engagement in Southeast Asia, and to the organization's emphasis on multilateral processes. The United States is the last major Pacific power to have acceded. The fact that the United States was not a party to the TAC had been one of many pieces of evidence that Southeast Asian leaders cited in arguing that the United States neglected Southeast Asia generally, and ASEAN specifically. Southeast Asian leaders generally have welcomed the Obama Administration's move, which seems to be designed to boost the United States' standing in Southeast Asia by expanding the multilateral component of U.S. policy in the region. Some U.S. and Southeast Asian officials and analysts say that expanding U.S. engagement with ASEAN will help boost Southeast Asia's political stature, particularly as China seeks to continue expanding its influence in the region.", "The major concern with accession is whether the TAC's emphasis on non-interference in other countries' domestic affairs will constrain U.S. freedom of action, particularly its ability to maintain or expand sanctions on Burma. Proponents of accession often note that Australia has imposed and expanded financial and travel restrictions on Burma since it acceded in 2005. Canberra's restrictions are far less extensive than the sanctions the United States maintains on Burma. The Administration and ASEAN negotiated and exchanged side letters designed to alleviate these concerns. Other objections to accession included arguments that it will accord greater legitimacy to the ruling Burmese junta; a view that ASEAN is insufficiently \"action-oriented\"; and a belief that the TAC is an untested, arguably ineffectual agreement.", "One issue for U.S. policymakers was whether accession to the TAC should take the form of a treaty, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, or whether the President already has sufficient authority to enter the TAC without further legislative action being necessary.

Many leaders in the region have felt neglected by the United States in recent years. ASEAN leaders have long viewed the TAC not only as a constitutional document for the organization, but also as establishing guiding principles that have built confidence among members, thereby contributing to maintaining regional peace and stability. Accession to the TAC by non-members often is seen as a symbol of their commitment to engagement in Southeast Asia and the organization's emphasis on multilateral processes. As shown in Table 1 , prior to July 2009, the United States was the only major Pacific power that had not joined the TAC; traditionally, the U.S. presence in Southeast Asia has been organized primarily along bilateral lines. ", "Additionally, acceding to the TAC is also one of the three requirements for joining the East Asia Summit (EAS), a four-year old forum that features an annual meeting among the heads-of-state of the ASEAN members, China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, and New Zealand. The other two requirements are dialogue partnership and significant economic relations with ASEAN, both of which the United States already meets. It is unclear whether the Obama Administration plans to join the EAS, or to what extent U.S. participation would be resisted by EAS members, particularly China and Malaysia, which in the past have voiced reservations with U.S. participation. Australia's accession to the TAC in 2005, which reversed years of official policy, was primarily motivated by Canberra's desire to be a founding member of the EAS.", "Joining the TAC had been proposed by many in the Asia policy community for several years, and the idea was debated in the George W. Bush Administration. Objections to joining the TAC included arguments that the TAC's emphasis on non-interference in domestic affairs (particularly in Articles 2, 10, and 13) would constrain U.S. freedom of action, particularly its ability to penalize Burma; a concern that the treaty would undermine U.S. security agreements with Asian allies, notably Japan, South Korea, and Australia; a belief that acceding would accord greater legitimacy to the ruling Burmese junta; a view that ASEAN is insufficiently \"action-oriented\"; and a belief that the TAC is an ineffectual, largely symbolic agreement.", "Proponents of accession countered that the decisions by U.S. allies Australia, South Korea, and Japan to accede to the TAC should negate concerns that the TAC would constrain U.S. policy and/or undermine U.S. alliances. As discussed in detail below, as part of their accession negotiations, Australia and South Korea both signed side letters with ASEAN that were designed to alleviate similar concerns. (See Appendix B .) Along the same lines, Japan reached an understanding with ASEAN prior to its accession to the TAC. Following the Australian and South Korean model, the Obama Administration negotiated and exchanged side letters with the Chairman of ASEAN (who in July 2009 was the Thai Foreign Minister) designed to prevent the TAC from constraining U.S. foreign policy actions.", "During the debate over accession, Australia's October 2007 promulgation of targeted financial and travel restrictions on over 400 members of the Burmese regime in the aftermath of the regime's September 2007 crackdown against peaceful protesters was cited as evidence that the TAC would not necessarily constrain U.S. policy. Australia, like Japan, has generally followed a policy of quiet engagement of Burma, seasoned with occasional public criticisms and targeted penalties. Canberra's restrictions against the Burmese regime are not nearly as expansive as U.S. sanctions. During its first weeks in office, the Obama Administration announced it would initiate a review of U.S. policy toward Burma.

China in particular has expanded its presence and influence in Southeast Asia since the early 2000s. Some commentators have argued that Beijing's increased presence has jeopardized U.S. influence. Others contest this assertion, arguing that the U.S. and China are not locked in a \"zero sum\" situation in Southeast Asia, that some of China's actions since 2007 have made some Southeast Asians wary of Beijing's actions, and/or that Chinese diplomacy in Southeast Asia is perceived as successful because China has tended to prioritize areas of mutual agreement while putting off issues that are more difficult to resolve. Regardless of whether U.S. interests are materially threatened, China's increased presence in Southeast Asia has made many Southeast Asian leaders eager for a strong U.S. presence in the region.

Increasingly, ASEAN is a vehicle for Southeast Asian nations to resolve problems through the \"ASEAN way\" of informal, consensus-based, and confidence-building efforts rather than through binding commitments or agreements. Since the early 1990s, ASEAN also has been playing a leading role in moving the countries of East Asia toward organizing into cooperative multilateral arrangements. ASEAN often takes the lead in building multilateral institutions because it is viewed as less threatening than China or Japan. Some analysts speculate that this role of neutral convener may be losing some of its utility, as evidenced by the first-ever standalone China-Japan-South Korea tripartite summit in December 2008. Follow-on summits are expected.

ASEAN also has not appeared to play a role in some conflicts among members, such as the 2008 and 2009 border skirmishes between Thailand and Cambodia.

These moves often have been resisted by other members, particularly Vietnam, Cambodia, and Burma.

However, these items eventually were stripped from the charter. In July 2009, ASEAN's Foreign Ministers approved the creation of the organization's first-ever human rights body.

If all ASEAN Members consent to a candidate's proposed accession to the TAC, the Chairman is authorized to sign a preliminary declaration of consent to accession on behalf of ASEAN Members. The accession process is completed once all ASEAN foreign ministers sign an instrument formally consenting to the candidate party's accession to the TAC, and the candidate party signs and submits the instrument of accession. The instrument of accession is typically signed and deposited by the acceding State's foreign minister.", "Negotiations regarding accession to the TAC may raise issues related to the interpretation and application of the agreement's provisions. In many cases, a party will attach a reservation, declaration, or understanding to an agreement at the time of accession or ratification when questions or concerns arise regarding an agreement's potential application. The TAC does not contain a provision barring this practice. However, ASEAN members have historically been unwilling to permit an acceding State to make a reservation or declaration upon accession.", "Some States seeking to accede to the TAC have instead sought to reach common understandings with ASEAN members regarding the interpretation of certain TAC provisions, and have recorded these shared understandings in an exchange of notes (\"side letters\") with the ASEAN Chairman prior to acceding to the TAC. Although these side letters are not understood to amend or modify the TAC, they may serve as important interpretative guidance as to the meaning of its provisions. The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which is recognized as an authoritative guide to treaty law and practice, states that \"any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty\" may be relied upon to assist in interpreting the underlying treaty.", "The United States memorialized its understanding of certain TAC requirements during communications with the ASEAN Chairman regarding its proposed accession.

Legally binding international agreements entered into by the United States take the form of either a treaty or an executive agreement. If an agreement is entered into as a treaty, the Senate must provide its advice and consent by a two-thirds majority for the agreement to become \"the Law of the Land.\" The great majority of international agreements that the United States enters into are not treaties but executive agreements\u2014agreements made by the executive branch that are not submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent. Depending upon the circumstances, authority to enter an executive agreement may derive from different sources, including from a statute enacted by Congress which authorizes the Executive to enter the agreement (a congressional-executive agreement), or pursuant to the Executive's constitutional authority in a given area (sole executive agreement). There are a number of provisions in the Constitution that may confer limited authority upon the President to promulgate sole executive agreements, including his Commander-in-Chief authority and power in the area of foreign affairs. Ultimately, the executive branch opted to accede to the TAC as a sole executive agreement, presumably because the agreement is deemed to focus solely upon relations between TAC parties and impose no requirements upon parties' domestic activities.", "Arguably, U.S. accession to the TAC could have taken the form of a treaty, with accession being subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, or an executive agreement. Agreements concerning friendly relations, consultation, and cooperation between countries have taken both forms. The United States has concluded numerous agreements which concern amity or friendly relations between parties as treaties. However, these agreements have traditionally focused on different matters than the TAC. Agreements concerning amity and cooperation that have taken the form of treaties generally focus on the rights afforded to each party's nationals in the territory of the other State party. In contrast, the ASEAN TAC appears to focus exclusively on State-to-State relations. It does not appear that the TAC is intended to afford parties' nationals with individually enforceable rights in the territory of other TAC parties, or otherwise modify a State's internal practices.", "The United States has concluded several international agreements as executive agreements that address one or more issues covered by the ASEAN TAC\u2014e.g., cooperation on matters involving security, economics, and science and technology. In a few instances, the United States has entered international agreements of similar breadth to the TAC (and in some cases greater breadth) by way of executive agreement. For example, in 1982, the United States concluded an executive agreement with Spain in order to \"promote their cooperation in the common defense, as well as \u2026 economic, scientific, and cultural cooperation.\" Beyond establishing a general framework for relations in these areas, the agreement also contained specific provisions related to basing rights, defense procurement, the status of U.S. forces in Spain, and the establishment of joint committees to promote cooperation on economic, scientific, and cultural matters.", "The form that U.S. accession to the TAC would take was the subject of discussion between the executive and legislative branches. One issue that was discussed was the significance of the agreement being titled the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. Although agreements similar to the TAC have often been entered via executive agreements, none of these agreements referred to themselves as \"treaties.\" An examination of official compendiums of international agreements and other sources by CRS found only a single agreement currently in force at the time of U.S. accession to the TAC which, although referring to itself as a \"treaty,\" was concluded by the United States via executive agreement \u2014the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure.", "Although the TAC refers to itself as a \"treaty,\" it is important to distinguish the meaning of this term in the context of international law, in which \"treaty\" and \"international agreement\" are synonymous terms for all binding agreements, and \"treaty\" in the context of domestic American law, in which the term more narrowly refers to a particular subcategory of binding international agreements. In other words, the fact that the TAC uses the word \"treaty\" in its title does not necessarily mean that it must take the form of a \"treaty\" for purposes of U.S. law. Perhaps to prevent confusion, U.S. negotiators have generally avoided using the term \"treaty\" whenever drafting language of an international agreement which is unlikely to be presented to the Senate for its advice and consent. Because the United States did not participate in the drafting of the TAC, it was not involved in the decision to entitle it a \"treaty.\"", "Shortly after the United States acceded to the TAC by way of executive agreement, Senator Mitch McConnell submitted into the Congressional Record a July 10, 2009, letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that had been signed by Senator McConnell as well as Senators John Kerry and Richard Lugar, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, respectively. In the letter, written prior to U.S. accession to the TAC, the Senators expressed their view that \"it is consistent with U.S. practice for the United States to accede to the TAC as an executive agreement.\" However, the Senators also expressed their belief that, while the TAC could properly be entered as a sole executive agreement, other agreements labeled \"treaties\" should generally be submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent. Specifically, the letter stated:", "We note that the title of the agreement refers to the agreement as a \"treaty,\" and we are unaware of any precedent for the United States acceding to an agreement styled as a \"treaty\" without the advice and consent of the Senate as provided for in Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution. At the same time, we are mindful that other factors apart from the formal name of the agreement could suggest that it is consistent with U.S. practice for the United States to accede to the TAC as an executive agreement. Of particular importance, the agreement is largely limited to general pledges of diplomatic cooperation and would [generally] not appear to obligate the United States to take (or refrain from taking) any specific action \u2026 We also note that the United States did not take part in the negotiations among ASEAN countries leading up to the conclusion of the TAC in 1976, or in the decision to characterize it as a treaty. In light of these unique considerations, we will not object to the Department's plan to accede to the TAC as an executive agreement. We continue to believe, however, that the use of the term \"treaty\" in the title of an agreement will generally dictate that Senate advice and consent will be required before the United States may accede to the agreement. In\u00a0this regard, treatment of the TAC as an executive agreement should not be considered a precedent for treating future agreements entitled \"treaties\" as sole executive agreements. To ensure our understanding that the process surrounding this agreement is not misinterpreted in\u00a0the future as a precedent, we will submit this letter into the Congressional Record. We would also request that the State Department include it in the next edition of the Digest of United States Practice in International Law.", "If Congress believes that accession to the TAC via sole executive agreement is inappropriate, or disagrees with the manner in which the Executive implements TAC requirements, it has several tools available by which it may address these concerns. For example, Congress could enact new legislation that modifies or repudiates U.S. adherence to or implementation of the agreement. It could require the Executive to submit information to Congress or congressional committees regarding U.S. implementation of its TAC commitments. Congress could also limit or prohibit appropriations necessary for the Executive to implement the provisions of the TAC, or condition such appropriations upon the Executive implementing the agreement in a particular manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Implications of TAC Accession for U.S. Law", "paragraphs": ["While the TAC may impose obligations upon parties in their mutual relations as a matter of international law , its requirements do not appear to be of the kind that would create binding federal law enforceable by U.S. courts. Many of the agreement's clauses address parties' obligations in non-specific terms\u2014e.g., requiring parties to \"endeavor to develop and strengthen \u2026 ties\" and \"achieve the closest cooperation on the widest scale.\" Such clauses appear to lack the precision necessary to be considered legally enforceable, though they may nonetheless carry political or moral weight for TAC parties. More broadly, while the agreement establishes guidelines for parties in their relations with one another, it does not expressly require parties to modify any of their existing domestic laws, even if such laws arguably conflict with the principles espoused by the TAC. Instead, the TAC expressly calls on parties to resolve any dispute between them through diplomatic means. Accordingly, it does not appear that U.S. accession to TAC would have the effect of modifying or limiting the enforcement of existing domestic laws, though the United States would have an obligation under customary international law to execute its obligations under the TAC in good faith.", "Nonetheless, the TAC may have implications for U.S. policies, at least as a matter of international law. Some States that have acceded to the TAC, including the United States, negotiated side letters that address the issues discussed in the following sections."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Right to Individual and Collective Self-Defense", "paragraphs": ["TAC Article 2 provides that a \"fundamental\" guiding principle in the relationship between parties is the \"renunciation of the threat or use of force.\" This prohibition is similar to that contained in Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter, which bars U.N. Member States \"from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.\" Unlike the U.N. Charter, however, the TAC does not provide an express exception to this bar in cases where force is used in self-defense.", "Even in the absence of a TAC provision recognizing parties' right to use force in self-defense, there is good reason to believe that the agreement is not intended to abrogate this right. Although TAC Article 2 lists six fundamental guiding principles in relations between TAC parties, including renunciation of the threat or use of force, it does not specify that these are the sole principles that may guide relations between State parties. Article 51 of the U.N. Charter recognizes that Members possess \"the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs.\" A nation's right to defend itself from attack is believed by many to be a peremptory norm ( jus cogens ), and accordingly any provision of an international agreement that derogated from this principle would not be legally binding. As such, it seems reasonable to interpret the TAC in a manner that would not be inconsistent with well-established principles concerning a nation's right to defend itself. Nonetheless, in negotiations concerning accession to the TAC, some States have found it necessary to exchange side letters in which it was made clear that parties to the TAC did not interpret the agreement as modifying parties' rights and obligations under the U.N. Charter, including as they relate to the right to self-defense.", "Related considerations might be raised with respect to the TAC's effect upon U.S. security arrangements. The United States is a party to numerous bilateral and multilateral security arrangements, including some which oblige parties to assist in the defense of any party that is attacked. Some TAC parties with security arrangements with the United States acceded to the TAC after reaching an understanding with ASEAN members that the TAC was not intended to affect other agreements to which they were parties. Prior to acceding to the TAC, the United States exchanged side letters reflecting its understanding that nothing in the TAC would affect its existing bilateral or multilateral relationships, its rights and obligations under the U.N. Charter, or its ability to take actions it \"considers necessary to address a threat to its national interests.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Relationship Between the TAC and Other Agreements Concerning Human Rights, Trade, Terrorism, Transnational Crime, and Other Matters", "paragraphs": ["The TAC might also be interpreted as having implications for U.S. policy on matters occurring in the territory of another party to the agreement, if the policy is interpreted as violating the TAC parties' obligations concerning non-interference. TAC Article 2 provides that relations between parties shall be guided by the principle of \"non-interference in the internal affairs of one another.\" This obligation could be interpreted as being a narrowly circumscribed requirement, prohibiting parties from actively attempting to undermine other parties' sovereignty or territorial integrity. However, it is possible that some countries might argue that the prohibition is more broadly applicable to TAC party activities towards one another, including, for example, criticism of another party's domestic human rights record. It is also possible that some countries may argue that the TAC bars the imposition of economic or other sanctions upon a TAC party on account of that party's domestic activities. This issue may be of particular concern for the United States on account of its stringent economic sanctions regime against Burma, a member of ASEAN whose consent is necessary for U.S. accession.", "State practice arguably conflicts with the view that the TAC is intended to deter parties from commenting upon or engaging on matters of international interest that arise within the territory of another TAC party. Indeed, some TAC parties have adopted specific measures, including economic sanctions, to deter human rights violations and other practices occurring in the territory of another party. For example, as mentioned above, both Australia and France, which are each parties to the TAC, have imposed sanctions upon Burma. Nonetheless, it is possible that U.S. sanctions policy may become an issue of contention with some TAC members.", "The United States and most other parties to the TAC are also parties to international agreements that obligate or permit members to take action to deter specified activities arising in other countries, including with regard to matters involving unfair trade practices, transnational criminal activity, international terrorism, and gross human rights violations. Further, all TAC parties are members of the United Nations, and may be required to comply with Security Council resolutions imposing economic sanctions upon a particular country (including, potentially, another party to TAC). In addition, Article 1 of the U.N. Charter provides that one of the purposes of the organization is \"to achieve international cooperation ... in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.\" This language arguably imposes a right and obligation upon U.N. Members to abide by these principles in their relations with other States. Some States acceding to TAC have exchanged side letters with ASEAN Members to clarify the parties' mutual understanding that the TAC is not intended to prevent parties from exercising rights and obligations under other international agreements, including the U.N. Charter.

The letters reflected the shared understanding that the High Council could not resolve a dispute in which a State outside Southeast Asia was directly involved without the State's consent, and that if the State agreed to the High Council being convened, it would be permitted to participate in the Council.

First, Australia's accession to the Treaty would not affect Australia's obligations under other bilateral or multilateral agreements. Second, the Treaty is to be interpreted in conformity with the United Nations Charter, and Australia's accession would not affect Australia's rights and obligations arising from the Charter of the United Nations.
