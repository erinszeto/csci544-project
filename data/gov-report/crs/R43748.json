Its main purpose is for members to form a regional trading bloc and forge stronger economic ties with the Asia-Pacific region. Costa Rica and Panama are candidates to become full members once they meet certain requirements. The United States joined the Alliance as an observer on July 18, 2013. The United States has free trade agreements with all four countries and has significant trade and foreign policy ties with the region. The Pacific Alliance is of interest to Congress because of the role of the United States as an observer country and also because of the strong linkages between the United States and the member countries. It may also be of interest to Congress in the context of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement. Three of the four Pacific Alliance member countries are parties to the TPP.", "The Alliance was officially created when the heads of state of Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru signed a Presidential Declaration for the Pacific Alliance, now known as the Lima Declaration. The objectives are to build an area of deep economic integration; to move gradually toward the free circulation of goods, services, capital, and persons; to promote economic development, regional competiveness, and greater social welfare; and to become a platform for trade integration with the rest of the world, with a special emphasis on the Asia-Pacific region. One of the requirements for membership is that a country must have free trade agreements with all other member countries.", "The four member countries have embraced free trade as far back as the 1980s and have multiple free trade agreements with many countries, including the United States, Canada, China, and the European Union. They represent 37% of Latin America's population, 35% of its total GDP; 46% of its exports, and 50% of its imports. Mexico accounts for much of the economic strength of the group, representing 61% of the combined gross domestic product.", "Observer countries play an important role within the Alliance. Being an observer country may help a country better understand the issues being negotiated and also provides opportunities for participation in activities such as trade forums and educational seminars. The Alliance has 42 observer countries, including the United States, Australia, Canada, China, several Central and South American countries, numerous European countries, Israel, Japan, Turkey, and others.", "The Alliance's approach to trade integration is often looked upon as a pragmatic way of deepening economic ties. It is more outward focused than other regional initiatives such as the Common Market of the South (Mercosur). Another unique characteristic is that the four member countries share similar economic and political ideals and are moving forward quickly to accomplish their goals. Member countries have signed various agreements to share use of their facilities or embassies and consulates to further advance the objectives of the integration process. In February 2014, Presidents of Pacific Alliance countries signed the Additional Protocol of the Framework Agreement, which immediately eliminated 92% of tariffs among members. Some analysts see the Pacific Alliance as a potential rival to Mercosur and have noted that it could put pressure on other Latin American countries to pursue more market-opening policies. The Alliance has a larger scope than free trade agreements, such the proposed TPP, since the Alliance involves the free movement of people and includes measures to integrate the stock markets of member countries."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Pacific Alliance is a regional integration initiative comprised of Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru.

Observer status may help countries better understand the issues being negotiated in the Alliance and could help a country ultimately decide if wants to join as a member. One of the goals in the case of Australia, for example, would be to diversify trade by going beyond supplying the energy and minerals that have dominated its trade with Asia. While that particular trade pattern has led to a substantial increase in Australia's gross domestic product, it has not resulted in higher productivity, which would be necessary to raise living standards.

", "As the four countries deepen their efforts and add new members to the group, they may face challenges in sustaining the current dynamism and focus. One of the major challenges is that trade among the partner countries is low and the countries are a long way from exporting goods entirely made within the region. Member countries may have to make considerable efforts and heavily involve the private sector to create supply chains. They may have to focus on developing the appropriate policies to create conditions within the region that would allow for the development of supply chains. There also may be challenges in increasing trade linkages with Asian countries. Attempts to expand trade liberalization measures with other countries may prove difficult because of the potential complexities in coordinating and managing these efforts. Although the Alliance has drawn much international attention, the future of the regional trade initiative is uncertain. According to one Latin America policy expert, there may be a \"disconnect to some extent between some of the great projections and expectations and the real continuing deficiencies in key areas like infrastructure.\"", "One of the major strengths of the initiative is that member countries share similar economic goals. These similarities can provide the pragmatic flexibility to move forward together on their objectives. As long as member countries focus on trade and investment, and not politics, the likelihood for deeper integration may be greater. Some observers believe that the Pacific Alliance can serve as a \"hub for knitting together FTAs with Latin American partners and linking up to the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.\" Other observers contend that the Alliance may fall victim to past patterns of regional initiatives and lose its momentum. The government of Chilean President Michelle Bachelet expressed concerns about moving ahead with the Pacific Alliance if it meant leaving other countries in the region behind. In June 2014, Chile's former President Ricardo Lagos and Brazil's former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva expressed their view that the Alliance would be more effective in achieving its goals by first deepening the trade relationship with Argentina and Brazil. These views may have prompted the Alliance to reach out to representatives from South America's big trade bloc Mercosur. ", "Three of the four Pacific Alliance members (Chile, Mexico, and Peru) are parties to the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, a proposed FTA among 12 countries, including the United States, which aims to liberalize trade in goods and services, remove barriers to foreign investment, and enhance trade rules and disciplines on a range of issues. While the Pacific Alliance has a larger scope than the proposed TPP since it involves the free movement of business people for certain time periods and an integration of the stock markets of member countries, numerous observers have noted that the two could be complementary agreements.
