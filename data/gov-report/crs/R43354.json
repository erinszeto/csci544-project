Federal law contains a number of such restrictions, each of which applies to different entities and supplies, and imposes somewhat different requirements. Some of these restrictions have, however, been waived pursuant to the Trade Agreements Act (TAA).", "The Buy American Act of 1933 is the earliest and arguably the best known of the major domestic content restrictions. It generally requires federal agencies to purchase \"domestic end products\" and use \"domestic construction materials\" on contracts exceeding the micro-purchase threshold (typically $3,500) performed in the United States. Unmanufactured end products or construction materials qualify as \"domestic\" if they are mined or produced in the United States. Manufactured ones are treated as \"domestic\" if they are manufactured in the United States, and either (1) the cost of components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50% of the cost of all components, or (2) the items are commercially available off-the-shelf items. Agencies may, however, purchase \"foreign\" supplies in exceptional circumstances (purchase of domestic goods or use of domestic construction materials would be \"impracticable\").", "The TAA permits the President to waive the application of domestic content restrictions that would discriminate against \"eligible\" products or suppliers from countries that have trade agreements with the United States or meet certain other criteria. The Buy American Act is one restriction that has been so waived. This means that certain federal agencies must generally treat end products or construction materials that have been wholly grown, produced, or manufactured in designated countries, or that have been \"substantially transformed\" into new and different articles within designated countries using materials from other countries, the same as domestic ones when acquiring goods or services whose value exceeds certain monetary thresholds.", "The Berry Amendment, as currently codified in 10 U.S.C. \u00a72533a, requires that food, clothing, tents, certain textile fabrics and fibers, and hand or measuring tools purchased by the Department of Defense (DOD) using appropriated or other funds be entirely grown, reprocessed, reused, or produced within the United States, with certain exceptions (e.g., procurements by vessels in foreign waters). Until 2006, the Berry Amendment also required that any \"specialty metals\" (certain types of steel and metal alloys) contained in aircrafts, missile and space systems, ships, tank and automotive items, weapon systems, ammunition, or any components thereof, purchased by DOD be melted or produced in the United States, with certain exceptions. However, that prohibition has since been codified in 10 U.S.C. \u00a72533b.", "The Buy America Act is the name commonly given to domestic content restrictions imposed on states, localities, and other nonfederal entities as a condition of receiving specific grant funds administered by the Department of Transportation (DOT) and certain other federal agencies. The nature of the restrictions can vary depending upon the funds involved. However, by way of example, 23 U.S.C. \u00a7313 generally requires recipients of Title 23 funding to use in funded projects steel and iron produced in the United States, as well as manufactured products consisting \"predominantly\" of steel and iron that were produced in the United States, with certain exceptions (e.g., materials needed are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities of satisfactory quality).", "There are also a number of other domestic content restrictions that apply in specific contexts and, in many cases, are intended to address perceived \"gaps\" left by the four major domestic content regimes noted above."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["B roadly understood, domestic content restrictions are provisions which require that items purchased using specific funds appropriated by Congress be produced or manufactured in the United States.

However, these restrictions are potentially less stringent than they might at first appear, since Congress has permitted the President to waive them so that the United States may comply with its obligations under various international trade agreements and accomplish certain other goals, or expressly provided for supplies produced or manufactured in countries with which the United States has trade agreements to be treated the same as supplies produced or manufactured domestically. Such promotion of trade has also been seen as generally benefitting U.S. firms and labor by facilitating the export of supplies and services in whose production the United States enjoys competitive advantages. ", "Federal law currently has four major domestic content regimes, which apply in different contexts and impose different requirements upon the use of federal procurement, grant, and other funds: ", "1. The Buy American Act of 1933 , as amended, generally requires federal agencies to purchase \"domestic end products\" and use \"domestic construction materials\" on contracts exceeding the micro-purchase threshold (typically $3,500) performed in the United States. 2.

The Buy America Act \u2014which is the popular name for a group of domestic content restrictions that have been attached to specific grant funds administered by the Department of Transportation (DOT) and certain other federal agencies\u2014generally requires that steel, iron, and manufactured products made primarily of steel or iron and used in infrastructure projects be produced or manufactured in the United States.

Specifically, the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) implementing the Buy American Act require that, when a domestic offer (i.e., an offer of a domestic end product) is not the low offer, the procuring agency must add a certain percentage of the low offer's price (inclusive of duty) to that offer before determining which offer is the lowest priced, or provides \"best value\" for the government. This percentage typically ranges from 6%, in cases where the lowest domestic offer is from a large business; to 12%, when the lowest domestic offer is from a small business; to 50%, for Department of Defense procurements, although agencies may adopt higher percentages by regulation. If the domestic offer is the lowest, or tied for lowest, after the application of this price preference, the agency must generally award the contract to the domestic offeror. However, if the foreign offer still has the lowest price, the agency may generally award the contract to the foreign offeror pursuant to provisions of the Buy American Act permitting the purchase of foreign end products, and the use of foreign construction materials, when the costs of domestic ones are \"unreasonable.\"", "The Buy American Act makes separate provisions for federal agencies' purchase of supplies and their construction of \"public works,\" as discussed below. It also incorporates several exceptions that permit the use of foreign end products and construction materials even if the cost of domestic ones is not \"unreasonable.\" In addition, the application of the Buy American Act has been waived in certain procurements pursuant to the Trade Agreements Act (TAA).

Unmanufactured end products must be mined or produced in the United States in order to qualify as \"domestic\" for purposes of the Buy American Act. Manufactured end products, in contrast, qualify as domestic if they are manufactured in the United States, and either (1) the cost of the components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50% of the cost of all components, or (2) the end product is a commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item.", "The meaning of \"manufacture\" is not defined by the Buy American Act, executive orders implementing the act, or the FAR, and determining whether particular activities constitute \"manufacturing\"\u2014such that a product can be said to be manufactured in the United States\u2014can be complicated. In answering this question, judicial and other tribunals have, at various times, considered whether there were \"substantial changes in physical character\"; whether separate manufacturing stages were involved, or whether there was one continuous process; and whether the article is completed in the form required by the government. Operations performed after the item has been completed (e.g., packaging, testing) generally are not viewed as manufacturing.
