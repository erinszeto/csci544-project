However, many different algorithms/models may be developed to evaluate credit risk for different types of loans or other purposes, each including different factors or weighting the same factors differently. Additionally, aside from the major credit-score producers, there are other businesses generating and selling credit scores. Also, lender/creditors may develop their own in-house algorithms/models and generate their own scores rather than purchasing them from FICO, for example. These credit scoring algorithms/models and the credit scores generated by them constitute proprietary information of the firms developing them and/or the licensed users and retailers of such algorithms/models and the scores generated by them.", "According to the CFPB, several factors commonly are included in the calculation of a credit score:", "history for timeliness or delinquency in paying bills; number, types, available credit, current balances, and duration of credit accounts; percentage of available credit being used; recent credit activity such as applications for credit or opening new credit accounts; and existence and age of negative information, such as debt collection, foreclosure, or bankruptcy actions or other judgments or liens.", "A credit score represents a snapshot of a consumer's creditworthiness based on the credit report/history at the time the score was calculated. Therefore, it can change over time as a consumer's credit history continues to evolve. Different definitions of \"good\" and \"bad\" credit behavior and different uses of these attributes among scoring algorithms/models can affect the resulting score or range of scores produced with respect to a given consumer.", "Credit scores may be based partly on the information in a credit report and are used to evaluate creditworthiness. Therefore, the factors that may be used in calculating credit scores are subject to restrictions on credit reports under the FCRA, noted above, to the degree that they are derived from such reports, and are subject to prohibitions against discrimination under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA). The ECOA prohibitions include discriminating against any credit applicant on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status, or age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract); because all or part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program; or because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the ECOA.", "As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bureau issued a report in 2011 on the nature, range, and size of variations between credit scores sold to creditors and those sold to consumers by CRAs and whether such variations disadvantage consumers. The report summarized the types, uses, and FCRA disclosure requirements for credit scores and analyzed how a consumer could be adversely affected by the potential differences between an educational score purchased by the consumer and the actual score used by a prospective lender/creditor in determining whether to extend credit to the consumer or what the terms for credit will be. As noted above, there are various reasons for the differences among the scores that may be generated for a given consumer. All this is aside from any differences that may result from inaccuracies in the items comprising a credit report/history. A credit score purchased by a consumer that is different from the score purchased or generated by a lender/creditor could give the consumer a misleading impression of his/her creditworthiness. This could result in the consumer applying for a loan amount for which he/she will be denied, if the consumer-purchased score is more favorable than the one used by the lender/creditor. On the other hand, a consumer may be discouraged from applying for credit if a purchased score that is less favorable than the one generated by the algorithm used by the lender/creditor. ", "The CFPB issued a follow-up report in 2012 that analyzed credit score variations over approximately 200,000 credit files from three nationwide CRAs, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion, representing scores typically sold to consumers and to lender/creditors. The study concluded that for the majority of consumers \"the scores produced by different scoring models provide similar information about the relative creditworthiness of the consumers. . . . For a substantial minority, however, different scoring models gave meaningfully different results.\" Because consumers cannot know in advance whether the score he/she has purchased will be significantly different from the score the lender/creditor will use, the study cautioned that consumers should be wary of relying solely on the scores they purchase in assessing their creditworthiness when determining whether to apply for credit and what terms to expect. The report further advised consumers to (1) be aware that many scores exist in the marketplace; (2) check credit reports for accuracy, taking advantage of the annual free credit report, and dispute any errors since these are the basis for credit scores; and (3) shop for credit, because even if lenders use the same score, they may offer different loan terms based on other factors, such as different competitive pressures or risk models. Finally, the report emphasized that providers of educational scores should make clear to consumers that there is a potential for differences, sometimes significant, between the scores they purchase and the ones a lender/creditor might use."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Permissible Uses of Consumer Credit Reports", "paragraphs": ["The FCRA outlines the purposes for which a consumer credit report may be furnished to a requester.

An insurer may receive a report in connection with the underwriting of an insurance policy involving the consumer for which the consumer has applied.

In addition, because lenders increasingly use credit scores as thresholds for loan eligibility as well as to determine appropriate loan terms, there has been interest in Congress in regulating how credit scores are calculated. For example, S. 160 would bar including certain medical debt in credit reports on the grounds that people generally do not intentionally incur medical or health care expenses but rather incur them through \"no fault of the consumer\" or by an \"act of God.\" By restricting medical debt that has been in collection and subsequently paid or settled from being included in credit reports, S. 160 would effectively exclude such medical debt from credit score calculations. ", "There are, however, several concerns with regulating credit reports and scores. First, because credit scores are calculated pursuant to proprietary formulae, requiring CRAs to provide free scores may amount to an unconstitutional taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. While this concern was raised during Congress' consideration of the FACT Act provision requiring CRAs to provide free annual credit reports, courts do not appear to have resolved this issue yet.", "Second, a consumer does not have a single credit score. As noted above, creditor/lenders formulate or contract with third parties for credit score algorithms that reflect the creditor/lender's particular needs. As a consequence, consumers may have many credit scores, reflecting various algorithms that weigh factors differently. Thus, even if CRAs were statutorily required to provide a free credit score or even a range of free credit scores to consumers, these scores may not reflect the score that a creditor/lender actually uses to determine whether and under what terms to extend a loan to a consumer.", "Third, restricting or dictating how credit scores are formulated would arguably undermine a creditor/lender's ability to use credit scores to assess quickly a potential debtor/borrower's creditworthiness. While there may be legitimate concerns about credit score accuracy and fairness, limiting how creditor/lenders determine such scores precludes them from ascertaining risk factors that they deem relevant for assessing creditworthiness. Although a creditor/lender could always rely on the full credit report, a more detailed loan application, or interviews with the potential borrower/debtor, these alternatives could increase the creditor/lender's costs. In addition, dictating the content of proprietary formulas would set precedent for intervening legislatively in this type of financial product. Restricting certain items from appearing in credit reports would similarly affect the access of a creditor/lender to a complete and accurate picture of the creditworthiness of a debtor/borrower."], "subsections": []}]}}
