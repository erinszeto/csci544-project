In 2007, the basic minimum wage was raised, in steps, from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour. The basic minimum wage was raised to $7.25 an hour effective July 24, 2009. As of January 1, 2014, 21 states and the District of Columbia have minimum wage rates that are higher than the federal minimum wage. Basic minimum wage rates in American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) are lower than in the continental United States. In 2007, Congress passed the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-28), which mandated annual increases of $0.50 an hour in the minimum wages of American Samoa and CNMI. In 2010, Congress temporarily suspended these increases. The minimum wage in CNMI increased by $0.50 an hour to $5.55 on September 30, 2012, and is scheduled to rise to $6.05 an hour on September 30, 2014. In July 2012, Congress delayed the wage increases in American Samoa. The next minimum wage increases in American Samoa are scheduled for September 30, 2015.", "Subminimum Wage Rates", "Tipped employees may be paid less than the basic minimum wage, but their cash wage plus tips must equal at least the basic minimum wage of $7.25.

Congress also found that these decreased wages caused one-third of the U.S. population to be \"ill-nourished, ill-clad, and ill-housed.\" To counter these conditions, in 1938 Congress established a minimum wage of $0.25 an hour, gradually increasing to $0.40 an hour in 1945. Congress has since legislated several increases in the minimum wage. It now stands at $7.25 an hour.", "The FLSA also mandates a pay rate of one-and-one-half times an employee's hourly wage for every hour the employee works beyond a standard work week. When enacted, the FLSA required employers to pay overtime for hours worked in excess of 44 hours in a week. The 44-hour threshold was lowered to 40 hours in 1940. The purpose of the overtime provision is to reduce unemployment by encouraging employers to hire more workers, rather than requiring current employees to work more than 40 hours per week and pay the premium overtime rate. ", "Finally, under the FLSA Congress set certain conditions under which children could work. Not only was oppressive child labor considered immoral, as children often worked at the cost of their own health and education, but Congress also believed that the lower wages generally earned by children drove down the wages of adult workers.

Congress excluded from hours worked time spent traveling to and from work. Congress also stated that some \"preliminary\" and \"postliminary\" activities performed before or after the workday are not hours worked. However, workers could be compensated for such activities if the worker and employer agreed to such employment terms or if compensation for the activities was customary in the place of employment.
