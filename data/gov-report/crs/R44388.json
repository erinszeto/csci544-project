The act's authorization totaled roughly $305 billion for FY2016 through FY2020. This included $233 billion for highways and highway safety, $61 billion for public transportation, and more than $10 billion for Amtrak.", "Most of the funding for surface transportation bills has been drawn from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) since its creation in 1956, but the principal revenue source for the HTF, federal motor fuel taxes, has not generated sufficient revenue to cover HTF outlays since 2008. To fill this shortfall, Congress has relied on Treasury general fund transfers to make up the difference. Although Congress was unable to agree on a long-term solution to the HTF revenue issue, the FAST Act identified roughly $70 billion in budgetary offsets to support general fund transfers sufficient to pay for the five-year bill.", "The FAST Act builds upon the many programmatic changes made in the previous multiyear reauthorization bill, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21; P.L. 112-141).

This includes $233 billion for highways and highway safety, $61 billion for public transportation, and more than $10 billion for Amtrak.", "The five-year duration of the act reestablishes the pattern of five- or six-year surface transportation authorization bills (often bound together by a series of short-term authorization acts) that dates back to the early 1990s. The bill also provides sufficient funds for a modest increase in spending for both highways and public transportation over expected inflation. This is a change from the pattern of declines in real spending for highways since the early 2000s. On the programmatic side, the changes were small in comparison with the previous reauthorization act, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21 st Century Act (MAP-21; P.L. 112-141 ), which made major changes in programmatic structure and operations but provided for only two years of funding (FY2013-FY2014). Although the FAST Act creates several new discretionary programs, well over 92% of spending from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) will be distributed by formula under the law.", "The FAST Act makes two important changes in transportation programs. It is the first surface transportation act to emphasize the national importance of moving freight, and funds two new freight programs. It is also the first law to treat intercity passenger rail as an integral part of the federal surface transportation program; previously, Amtrak was authorized under separate legislation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Surface Transportation Finance and the Highway Trust Fund (HTF)", "paragraphs": ["Almost all of federal highway funding and about 80% of federal public transportation funding comes from the HTF. The HTF is financed from a number of sources, including taxes on fuels, tires, truck and trailer sales, and a weight-based heavy-vehicle use tax . However, approximately 90% of trust fund revenue comes from excise taxes on motor fuels, 18.3 cents per gallon on gasoline and 24.3 cents per gallon on diesel. The HTF consists of two separate accounts\u2014highway and mass transit. The highway account receives an allocation equivalent to 15.44 cents of the gasoline tax, and the mass transit account receives the revenue generated by 2.86 cents of the tax. Because the fuel taxes are set in terms of cents per gallon rather than as a percentage of the sale price, their revenues do not increase with inflation. The fuel tax rates were last raised in 1993.", "Sluggish economic growth and improved vehicle efficiency have depressed the growth of fuel consumption and therefore the growth of fuel tax revenue. Since FY2008, the revenues flowing into the highway account of the HTF have been insufficient to fund the expenditures authorized under the Federal-Aid Highway Program. Prior to the enactment of the FAST Act, resolving this discrepancy required seven general fund and other transfers totaling $73.3 billion (of which $62.5 billion went into the highway account) over a seven-year period. Without these transfers, FHWA might have faced delays in reimbursing states for completed work.", "Under the FAST Act, $70 billion will be transferred from the general fund to the HTF to fund the projected difference between HTF revenues and authorized spending for FY2016 through FY2020. An additional $300 million was provided by transfers from the Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) trust fund . This mixing of revenue sources lessens the relevance of the arguments that HTF funds should be used only on highways. It also reduces the salience of states' complaints that they are not receiving a fair share of highway spending relative to their highway tax payments to the HTF (the so-called donor-donee state issue). Under the FAST Act, the general fund transfers allow for spending levels for all states that will likely exceed their highway tax payments.", "A gap between dedicated HTF revenues and outlays is expected to persist after the FAST Act expires at the end of FY2020. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that beginning in FY2021, revenues credited to the highway and transit accounts of the HTF will be insufficient to meet the fund's obligations. CBO projects that over the five years following the expiration of the FAST Act, from FY2021 through FY2025, HTF receipts will fall $96 billion short of the amount needed to fund highway and public transportation programs at the current level, adjusted only for projected inflation. Congress will face the need to approve some combination of new taxes, an increase in existing dedicated taxes, further general fund transfers, an increase in federally supported debt financing, or reductions in the scope of the federal surface transportation program, if the FAST Act is to be replaced or extended in 2021."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Highways", "paragraphs": ["The Federal-Aid Highway Program (FAHP) is an umbrella term for the separate highway programs administered by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). These programs are almost entirely focused on highway construction, and generally do not support operations (such as administrative salaries or fuel costs) or routine maintenance (such as mowing roadway fringes or filling potholes). Each state is required to have a State Transportation Improvement Plan, which sets priorities for the state's use of FAHP funds. State departments of transportation (state DOTs) largely determine which projects are funded, award the contracts, and oversee project development and construction. More recently, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) have played a growing role in project decisionmaking in urban areas, but federal project funding continues to flow through state DOTs.", "The FAHP, unlike most other federal programs, does not rely on appropriated budget authority. Instead, FHWA exercises contract authority over monies in the HTF, and may obligate (promise to pay) funds for projects funded with contract authority prior to an appropriation. Once funds have been obligated, the federal government has a legal commitment to provide the funds. This approach shelters highway construction projects from annual decisions about appropriations.", "Under the FAST Act, 92% of FAHP funding is distributed through five core programs. These are the National Highway Performance Program (NHPP), the Surface Transportation Block Grant Program (STBG), the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP), the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ), and the National Highway Freight Program. The STBG was formerly known as the Surface Transportation Program, but was renamed in the FAST Act.", "All five core programs are formula programs, meaning that each state's share of each program's total annual authorization is based on a mathematical calculation set out in the law. The remaining programs, generally referred to as discretionary programs, are administered more directly by FHWA, but the funding distribution of some of these programs (such as the Construction of Ferry Boats and Ferry Terminal Facilities Program) is formulaic as well. The FAHP does not provide money in advance. Rather, a state receives bills from private contractors for work completed and pays those bills according to its own procedures. The state submits vouchers for reimbursement to FHWA. FHWA certifies the claims for payment and notifies the Department of the Treasury, which disburses money electronically to the state's bank, often on the same day the voucher is submitted by the state.", "After several years of flat funding in terms of nominal dollars, the FAST Act provides highway funding increases of 4.2% above previous law adjusted for expected future inflation (see Figure 1 and Table 1 ). The Federal-Aid Highway and research titles authorize an average of $45 billion annually for FY2016-FY2020. Of this, an average of $41 billion is provided annually for Federal-Aid Highway programs. The act includes no new congressional earmarks for highway projects.", "A major focus of the FAST Act is the movement of freight.

However, no transfers are permitted of funds that are suballocated to areas by population (such as a portion of STBG funds) or of Metropolitan Planning funds.

Bus Program funding increases to $809 million in FY2020, with $465 million (57%) provided for formula grants and $344 million (43%) for discretionary grants. Of the discretionary amounts, $55 million per year is set aside for the acquisition of low- or no-emission buses and related facilities.

The FAST Act seeks to facilitate infrequent bus purchases with a pilot program for the creation of voluntary state funding pools for transit agencies. The pilot program will allow formula Bus Program funds apportioned to transit agencies in urbanized areas with a population of 200,000 to 999,999 to be transferred between recipients participating in a pool. The distribution of funds to each recipient by the state funding pool over the FY2016-FY2020 period must be equal to the amount of funds that each would have received individually according to the Bus Program formula.", "The Capital Investment Grant (CIG) program (commonly known as the New Starts program) is a discretionary funding program for the construction of new fixed-guideway public transportation systems and the expansion of existing systems. The FAST Act increases the general fund authorization for the New Starts Program from $1.9 billion per year to $2.3 billion per year. However, these amounts are subject to appropriation. The new law changes the definition of a Small Starts project to one that involves $100 million or less of CIG funding (up from $75 million) and costs less than $300 million (up from $250 million). Another change to the New Starts Program is the authority to fund projects that benefit both public transportation and intercity passenger rail (although the eligible costs must be attributable to the transit portions of the project).
