Some itemized deductions are visible candidates for \"broadening the base\" of the individual income tax and cutting back on tax expenditures and primarily consist of deductions for mortgage interest, state and local taxes, and charitable contributions. The benefits of itemized deductions are concentrated among higher-income individuals, and that is particularly the case for state and local income tax deductions and charitable deductions.", "Proposals for addressing these provisions fall into two general classes. One approach could include repealing or restricting all itemized deductions. A different approach would consider each type of deduction and tailor a reform to the particular objectives and merits of the deductions, such as a lower ceiling on home mortgage interest deduction and a floor for charitable contributions.", "This report analyzes various proposals to restrict itemized deductions\u2014both across-the-board and individually tailored\u2014using standard economic criteria of economic efficiency, distribution, simplicity, and estimated revenue effects. In particular, this report estimates each proposal's potential to contribute to revenue-neutral reductions in income tax rates and the consequences for economic behavior.

One objective of lower rates is presumably to reduce the distortionary effects on labor supply and saving. The analysis in this report, however, shows that this trade-off, with respect to effects on labor supply or saving, may be more apparent than real. Economic theory indicates that the tax rate that should determine the supply responses is not the statutory marginal tax rate but the effective marginal tax rate (EMTR). If part of the earnings of the last dollar is spent on tax exempt uses, then EMTRs are lower, and eliminating these deductions raises them.", "It is possible for a revenue-neutral tax reform to have no effect on EMTRs, or even raise them, which, for some, may defeat the purpose of tax reform. Analysis in this report suggests that eliminating itemized deductions would increase the top EMTR by approximately 4\u00bd percentage points but permit a statutory rate reduction in a distributionally and revenue-neutral change by about 5 percentage points. Thus, the net effect of this change is a reduction of \u00bd a percentage point (a tenth the size of the statutory reduction). Proposals with ceilings could easily raise EMTRs.", "A traditional concern of tax expenditures is generally that they distort economic behavior. However, for each type of deduction there are also some justifications, although the magnitude may be in question. The provision that may have the most support from an economic efficiency standpoint is the deduction for charitable contributions.", "Some types of tax reform may simplify the tax code, but others can make it more complex.

The President has proposed substantive tax policy changes in his budget outlines. Further, both tax-writing committees have held hearings and have working groups on tax reform.

Itemized deductions are a group of tax expenditures likely to be considered as important candidates for reform. The major itemized deductions are for mortgage interest, state and local taxes, charitable contributions, and medical costs. The Ways and Means Committee has recently held hearings on provisions affecting state and local governments, charitable contributions, and housing tax provisions (including the home mortgage interest deduction).", "Itemized deductions account for about one-fifth of all tax expenditures, and may be easy targets of reform, based on their visibility and some policy grounds. In particular, itemized deductions are already listed on the 1040 income tax form and are easily measured. Eliminating some of them might contribute to tax simplification (unlike revisions such as including employee fringe benefits in income). At the same time, itemized deductions have broad support, and are claimed by roughly one-third of tax filers. Arguments can be made to justify some of these deductions and some of them are among the longest-standing provisions of the federal income tax code (see Appendix A for a brief history of itemized deductions).", "Reducing incentives and subsidies that alter taxpayers' choices is one potential objective of tax reform. In addition, as suggested by the differing budget resolutions, some proponents of reform see broadening the tax base as a means of raising revenue without raising tax rates, while others see it as a way to pay for reduced tax rates. For a given revenue target, tax reform can involve a trade-off between a broader base and lower rates. In addition, as outlined in this report, base-broadening could have unintended side effects, such as effects on savings incentives or the labor supply.", "A variety of proposals for limiting itemized deductions, either as an overall proposition or through specific revisions to certain deductions, have been advanced by policy makers, economists, and tax experts.

Tax deductions for state and local personal property taxes (on motor vehicles) were $7 billion. Mortgage interest deductions totaled $401 billion in 2010. Less than $2 billion of that amount was for home equity loan points, and less than $7 billion for qualified mortgage insurance premiums. The latter is also an \"extender.\" Charitable contribution deductions totaled $172 billion in 2010. Of these deductible contributions, $135 billion was in cash, $44 billion in property, and $31 billion carried over from prior years (due to limits on deductions as a percentage of income). Medical and dental expense deductions above the 7.5% floor totaled $85 billion in 2010. ", "These deductions have diverse purposes. Notably, for example, the deduction of extraordinary medical expenses is not an incentive to encourage spending but a provision to reflect ability to pay taxes. State and local income taxes are not under the control of the taxpayer in the short run (and cannot be avoided other than relocating), but the deduction may encourage state and local governments to enact these taxes. Benefits for homeownership and charitable contributions, however, arise from explicit choices of the taxpayer and are incentives to make the choice to own a home or donate to charity.", "Itemized deductions not classified as tax expenditures were $264 billion, although only $117 billion were allowed because many of these deductions are subject, as a group, to a floor and only amounts in excess of 2% of income are deducted. Examples of these itemized deductions (some limited and some not) are investment interest expenses, unreimbursed employee expenses, tax preparation expenses, other costs of earning income, such as investment expenses, and gambling losses.

These options may be limited for a variety of reasons, including difficulties in imputing income (as in the case of the present value of defined-benefit pension plans), difficulties in limiting the effects on middle-class taxpayers (as in the case of employer-provided health benefits), desires to protect savings incentives, or aversions to potential behavioral effects that reduce revenue (as in the case of capital gains).", "The maximum revenue gain from an elimination of itemized deductions is projected at $190 billion in 2015, which is 12% of individual income taxes and 44% of the projected deficit under the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO's) standard baseline.

Some are interested in keeping statutory tax rates low because they presume that lower rates limit the distorting effects of taxes on wage and capital income, thereby also limiting the effect of taxes on labor supply and savings rates (which are components of long-term growth). ", "This objective may not be obtainable, as there are many circumstances where restrictions on itemized deductions have similar effects to increases in tax rates; thus base broadening to permit lower rates should not be expected have a supply-side effect. As explained below, it is not the effect of pushing taxpayers into a higher rate bracket, but affecting the tax collected from a marginal dollar of income, which affects taxpayers in the top bracket as well as those in other brackets. This effect is often on the periphery of tax reform discussions, but it is an important issue because designing an efficient proposal to reform itemized deductions that does not lead to significant increases in effective marginal rates may conflict with distributional objectives.", "A recent article by Martin Sullivan, Chief Economist at Tax Analysts, argued the narrower point that base-broadening can increase marginal tax rates because, in some cases, because base-broadening expands taxable income enough for some itemizers to push them into higher tax brackets. Of course, this effect would not apply to the highest tax bracket because these tax filers are already being taxed at the top marginal tax rate.", "While this effect could certainly be a concern for some, there is a much more important and direct relationship between base-broadening, through restricting itemized deductions, and effective marginal tax rates. Whereas the statutory income tax rates are set in law, the effective tax rates at the margin are the share of an additional dollar of income that is paid in taxes. If part of an additional dollar of earnings is spent in a way that generates a tax deduction, it reduces the effective marginal tax rate (EMTR) for that tax filer. If that deduction is eliminated, then the EMTR rises. It is the EMTR\u2014not the statutory tax rate\u2014that could discourage the supply of labor or savings. Despite this potential concern, from a theoretical perspective, prior studies indicate that there is not a consensus among economists whether these marginal effects are statistically or economically significant.", "The most straightforward example of this effect is the itemized deduction for state and local income taxes. According to IRS statistics in 2010, the average deduction on itemized returns for state and local income taxes was 5.5% of income for those with an AGI of $200,000 or greater. Because most state income tax rates are progressive, income taxes paid as a share of income would be even higher at the margin. Using an example of 6%, if the federal statutory income tax rate is 35%, and the state income tax is deductible, the total EMTR is 35% plus 6% minus the value of the tax deduction (0.35 times 6%), or 38.9%. If the state and local income tax deduction is eliminated or capped, the EMTR rises to 41% (35% plus 6%). On average then, disallowing the state income tax deduction is the equivalent of raising the EMTR by 2.1 percentage points for those tax filers that would otherwise claim the deduction. Put another way, retaining the state and local deduction and simply raising the federal statutory rate to 37.2% for this bracket would achieve the same effect.", "As will be discussed in more detail when specific options are considered, how much of an increase in EMTR occurs depends on the nature of the proposed change, as some approaches are more likely to affect these marginal rates than others, across the various income groups. Similarly some itemized deductions are more likely to have a larger effect on marginal tax rates relative to revenue gain than others."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Behavioral Effects and Allocative Efficiency", "paragraphs": ["Itemized deductions were enacted into the federal tax code to serve a particular purpose.

", "Yet traditional tax reform presumes that provisions that are to be eliminated or constrained are undesirable in some fashion and one of the arguments is that they distort the allocation of resources. This concern suggests specific attention to the itemized deductions one by one.

Currently, there are tax provisions that favor individuals who have a preference for home ownership, or for charity, or for living in areas that provide a high level of state and local service. On the other hand, itemized deductions may increase horizontal equity in some instances, for example, between homeowners who can finance more of their home out of assets and those who need larger mortgages.

An additional flat-cap on itemized deductions would add complexity to the process of filing taxes. Compared with some other reform options, though, the flat-cap is simpler because it is not dependent on calculations of income or other tax benefits (e.g., exemptions). Tax filers who anticipate itemizing their deductions can tally their deduction-eligible activities (e.g., charitable contributions or home mortgage interest) as they go.

However, restricting tax provisions causes effective marginal rates to rise and could defeat the purpose of base-broadening to lower tax rates. This section discusses this issue for several types of revisions.", "The effective marginal rate is affected by tax-free uses of income, many of which are embodied in itemized deductions and affect the marginal rate on all types of income (e.g., wage, investment, self-employment). In the illustrations in this section, the calculations do not take into account the reductions in effective marginal rates for all tax expenditures that might have marginal effects or the lower tax rates on capital gains. Therefore, they should be seen as an illustration of what would occur for a taxpayer whose only tax benefits are itemized deductions.", "Not all itemized deductions have a marginal effect at every point along the income distribution. Some insight can be gained by looking at the pattern of deductions across income classes. If a deduction rises as income rises, it is likely that the deduction is not only marginal (affecting the last dollar of income) across all incomes, but is also higher at the margin than on average. As shown in Table 7 and in the earlier Table 2 , of the four major itemized deductions, the share of returns and AGI for two deductions tends to rise with income at almost every class over an AGI of $200,000: state income taxes and charitable gifts. If deductions rise as a share of income, the implication is that the deduction out of each marginal dollar is growing, and thus the elimination of deductions would increase effective taxation at the margin even in a revenue neutral tradeoff for lower statutory rates. If this share is falling, the deduction at the margin is smaller than the average deduction and could be zero. The mortgage interest deduction tends to decline with income at very high income levels (e.g., $10 million), which is not surprising as higher-income tax filers generally do not need to borrow as much (as a share of their income) to purchase their homes. In addition, homes may be a smaller part of these tax filers' budgets, which is also reflected in the declining value of property tax deduction claims as a share of AGI. In general, itemized deductions are a smaller percentage of itemizers' AGI as income rises.", "Outside of itemized deductions other provisions may involve tax-exempt income because of exclusions from income. For example, employer-provided benefits such as health insurance and pensions (or similar benefits for the self-employed) reduce the effective marginal tax rate on earnings from wages or self-employment. However, some of these benefits, for example, tax exclusions for health insurance, are unlikely to increase with income on average, especially when income grows to very high levels. Pension benefits are more likely to be marginal because pensions are related to income. Other benefits, such as tax-exempt state and local bonds, are more likely to rise with income and be marginal in some cases because these bonds are more attractive to taxpayers with higher tax rates.", " Table 7 also shows another potential issue with base-broadening through restricting itemized deductions: the \"costs\" of base-broadening might be concentrated among middle-income itemizers whereas the tax benefits of statutory rate reductions could spread across all tax filers. In all cases, a large share of these itemized deductions is on tax returns that have an AGI less than $200,000. Thus, if the policy goal is to protect middle-income itemizers from increased tax burdens through high ceilings, potential revenue gains are limited. For high-income taxpayers, who retain an average, but not a marginal, benefit from itemized deductions, the statutory rate reductions to keep their burden fixed would be too small to offset the rise in effective marginal tax rates from the loss of deductions at the margin. If ceilings are lowered to increase revenue and permit higher top statutory rate reductions, the burden on middle class taxpayers would increase. To avoid that effect, intermediate rates would have to be reduced, leaving less revenue for reducing the top rate (or rates)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Effects of Across-the-Board Options to Restrict Itemized Deductions on Effective Marginal Tax Rates", "paragraphs": ["As is the case with restricting individual itemized deductions provisions, some of the across-the-board options for base-broadening through restrictions on itemized deductions have consequences for effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs).

According to the data in Table 1 , a flat-cap would have to be around $50,000 to largely confine the effects to taxpayers with $250,000 or more in income (most itemized returns with high incomes are joint returns).

If a flat-cap is designed to largely avoid increasing EMTRs on returns with an AGI less than $250,000, the cap would probably raise relatively little revenue (see Table 5 ) because it would retain a large non-marginal benefit for itemized deductions from a smaller pool of higher-income tax filers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Share of AGI Cap on Itemized Deductions", "paragraphs": ["A percentage of income cap on all itemized deduction claims could be used to limit the marginal tax rate effect to a smaller number of tax filers.

First, they could increase the rates of homeownership and increase the average size of homes. According to empirical research on the issue, it is the tenure choice (i.e., renting versus owning), rather than the size of homes, that is more likely to lead to positive externalities in a community. Evidence, however, suggests that tenure choice is not affected very much by the tax benefits. Historically, the rate of homeownership has not changed although changes in inflation and tax rates have significantly affected the relative cost of owning versus renting. Also, homeownership rates are high in many countries without these benefits. Those on the margin between choosing to rent or own are likely to be younger or have lower incomes, and thus are less likely to itemize their deductions. Finally, the major barrier to owning a home is saving enough to provide a down payment, an issue that is not affected by the tax subsidy. The mortgage interest deduction and property tax deduction (as well as the exclusion of imputed net rent) may, instead, provide additional incentives for individuals who already intend to choose owning over renting to spend more on housing than they would absent the tax deduction.", "Some proposals for restricting the deductions related to homeownership would target them more towards moderate-income individuals.

The current home equity loan deduction is not targeted towards a particular behavior because home equity funds can be used to finance spending unrelated to the home. Instead of these tax incentives, a more desirable alternative for some could be loan programs that make it possible for younger families to acquire homes.", "The mortgage interest deduction and deduction of real property taxes are not the only provisions that reduce the cost of acquiring and maintaining a home. Economists argue that owner-occupied housing is also subsidized by the exclusion of net imputed rental income. Imagine two homeowners renting their houses to each other: they would include the rent received in income but deduct the homeownership costs, including depreciation, insurance, and maintenance as well as mortgage interest and property taxes. Thus, rather than claiming just deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes they would also increase their respective incomes by the net rental income. In other words, even if the deductions for home mortgage interest and real property taxes were eliminated, there would still be some tax benefits in place for homeowners. Moreover, eliminating deductions for home mortgage interest could put lower-income tax filers at a comparative disadvantage, as other individuals could have sufficient assets (such as higher-income tax filers) to offset the loss of tax benefits from the deduction by paying off their mortgages. Those that can pay off their mortgages effectively retain tax exemption because earnings on these assets have fallen; their net income may be no different, since they pay less interest, but also receive less capital income."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Charitable Deductions", "paragraphs": ["Tax benefits for charity probably enjoy more support among economists because charitable contributions are subject to market failures due to \"free-rider\" problems. The free-rider issues in the charitable sector of the economy refer to the extent that contributions are often undersupplied because individual tax filers can benefit from the contributions of others (even if they do not contribute, themselves), thus giving some individuals an incentive not to contribute while still receiving the benefits of charitable activities. For example, transfers to enhance public health can provide a social benefit to donors and also to non-donors if there is a social value to non-recipients, such reduced risk of contracting illness.", "Two issues, however, could make the deduction questionable. The first issue is that an individual contributor could give less to charity than the revenue loss associated with their tax deduction claim. If this were the case, then government could provide more funds for charitable purposes through grants rather than a tax deduction. This effect occurs when the elasticity of charitable contributions (percentage change in charity contributions from a 1% change in tax rates) is less than one, which most current research shows. In other words, the low elasticity found in this research indicates that changes in charitable contributions are not very responsive to changes in tax rates. The second issue is that the contributors may receive direct benefits, implicit benefits, or their contributions may go to charities that much of the population does not benefit from. For example, contributors could receive fringe benefits, such as front-row seats at the orchestra or box seats at sporting events, or may give to individual universities and art museums. In contrast, less than 8% of charitable contributions, by some estimates, goes directly to aid those in poverty.", "Adding a floor to the deduction for charitable contributions is often discussed as one option for reform. A floor that permitted only large contributions relative to income, could increase the tax-induced charitable contributions per dollar of revenue loss. For example, Table 6 provides revenue estimates for three different floor options (2% of income, $500, and $1,000) for the deduction for charitable contributions. A floor could also increase tax compliance since small donations would no longer be eligible. According to the latest data available, about 14% of contributions would no longer have a marginal incentive with a 2% floor, although the revenue gain would be 37% of the total tax expenditure. The relatively larger gain in revenue compared with the reduction in incentive is because most of the value of the contributions are made by tax filers who would retain a marginal incentive to give even after disallowing contributions up to 2% of income. These individuals are more likely to be higher-income individuals.", "As discussed subsequently in the section on administrative and transitional issues, some options related to the deduction for charitable contributions (including the floor and also limits on gifts of property) are also aimed at increasing tax compliance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State and Local Income and Personal Property Tax Deductions", "paragraphs": ["Deductions for state and local taxes reduce the costs to state and local governments of imposing taxes, and they could be viewed by some as a federal subsidy to the states. This implicit subsidy to the states could encourage more taxes or government services at the state and local level, or provide incentives for some states and localities to favor federally deductible taxes in their choice of revenue sources.", "This assessment could lead some to question whether the federal taxpayers should subsidize activities in specific states or localities, whether via tax subsidies or via direct grants. Some government services provided by state and local governments do potentially benefit all federal taxpayers to some degree (e.g., roads) while others do not (e.g., residential waste management). Given the mobility of the population, there are some general benefits to educational services (which is also a recipient of some of the tax benefits of general obligation tax-exempt bonds). Similarly, taxpayers in one state or locality could benefit from the awareness that the poor are being cared for in another state or locality. Still, the overall spending of state and local governments tends to largely benefit their own residents. Moreover, federal tax deductions for state and local taxes are not targeted, particularly with regard to ability to pay federal income taxes. In addition, those states that have higher-income tax rates tend to also have a preference for higher levels of public goods so that taxpayers are receiving higher levels of public goods (that are exempt from income tax). Also, the fact that several states do not have income taxes creates an inequality in the benefits of federal tax deductions that vary depending on the mix of revenue sources.", "Even if there is consensus among policy makers that the rationale of a federal tax subsidy for state and local governments is justified, alternatives to the current policy could still fulfill this rationale while also meeting other policy goals associated with federal tax reform. Depending on the primary policy goal, the deduction for state and local taxes could be capped at a flat-dollar or share of income, replaced with a credit, or certain types of state and local taxes could be disallowed.

Some have proposed to have more revenue raised from higher income classes.", "Although itemized deductions tend to benefit higher-income groups because they have more income, are more likely to itemize, and have higher tax rates, the relative concentration of tax benefits from itemized deduction differs across different provisions. According to the estimates in Table 9 , the share of tax benefits in 2012 from certain itemized deductions classified as tax expenditures for tax filers with incomes above $200,000 (the highest income range in Table 9 ) is 58% for charitable contributions and 56% for state and local taxes other than real estate. In contrast, those same tax filers receive 33% of the share of total tax benefits tax filers derived from the mortgage interest deduction and 25% share of the total tax benefits derived from the deduction for real estate taxes.", "Part of the reason some of the tax benefits of certain itemized deductions are concentrated in higher-income levels is because much of the income at that level is concentrated among a smaller number of tax filers. The distribution of tax benefits relative to incomes can also be illustrated visually using concentration curves, as shown in Figure 1 . The horizontal, x-axis of the concentration curve measures the cumulative percentage of income from poorest to richest. For example, the first 15% of cumulative adjusted gross income is the income reported by the poorest 50% of taxpayers in the sample. The vertical, y-axis measures the cumulative percentage of tax benefits of a tax expenditure. If the concentration is above the 45-degree diagonal line in the figures, then the tax benefits are larger as a share of income for lower-income taxpayers. If the concentration is below the diagonal line, then the tax benefits tend to accrue to high-income taxpayers (i.e., distributed more regressively).", "Note that the tax benefits for home mortgage interest, property taxes, charitable contributions and state and local sales or income taxes are each distributed regressively. The deduction for medical expenses is the only provision that exhibits some form of progressivity.", " Table 10 shows estimates from the Tax Policy Center (TPC) that provide a measure of progressivity by examining the tax benefits of certain itemized deductions as a share of a tax filer's after-tax income. If tax benefits are larger as a percentage of income for higher income individuals, then the provision is making after-tax income more unequal. TPC's data do not separate out real estate taxes, so the progressivity of state and local tax deductions reflects both the less progressive real estate taxes along with the more progressive income taxes and personal property taxes.", "In general, the effects of certain itemized deductions on after-tax income are relatively small for tax units with an income less than $50,000. The benefits of the mortgage interest deduction rise through the middle and upper classes, but eventually fall until they become negligible. On the other hand, the tax benefits as a share of income for the deductions for charitable gifts and state and local taxes rise with income.", "The percentage increase in after-tax income as a result of certain itemized deductions can help to inform the general number of percentage points that statutory tax rates could be cut to obtain a revenue-neutral, base-broadening restriction on itemized deductions. At the $500,000 and over income level, approximately where the top, marginal statutory tax rate begins, rates could be cut: approximately 1.75 percentage points if the itemized deduction for charitable gifts were eliminated, almost 3 percentage points if the deduction for state and local tax deductions were eliminated, and about 1.2 percentage points if the deduction for mortgage interest were eliminated. Overall, the top statutory rate could be reduced by about 5 percentage points in a revenue-neutral manner if all three of these itemized deduction provisions were eliminated.", " Table 11 shows the effects of various across-the-board options to restrict itemized deductions for the three highest income classes (i.e., over $200,000). For tax units in these higher-income classes, a flat-cap of $50,000 could eliminate most of the increase in after-tax income as a result of itemizing. By comparison, limiting the value to 2% of income would eliminate part of the tax benefits of itemized deductions to tax units at the highest income levels. In terms of statutory rate reductions, the $50,000 flat-cap option could permit reductions of slightly over 4 percentage points, and the limit in value to 2% of income could allow a rate reduction of 3 percentage points."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Horizontal Equity", "paragraphs": ["Whereas vertical equity considers the treatment of individuals with different income and presumably tax filers with different abilities to pay, horizontal equity considers taxpayers who have similar abilities to pay but different circumstances.

For example taxpayers who own their homes have a lower effective tax burden than renters \u2014 even if both taxpayers have the same AGI. As another example, taxpayers with a preference for charitable donations have lower tax burdens than those with other preferences.", "On the other hand, some itemized deductions could increase equity across taxpayers with similar abilities to pay. For example, a family with extraordinary medical expenses has a lesser ability to pay taxes than a family without those costs. A homeowner who has financed more of their home with assets will be effectively exempt from the income those assets are earning. By this logic, allowing a mortgage interest deduction may lead to more equitable treatment between those with a larger share of their home financed by a mortgage versus those with a lower share of their home financed by a mortgage. One could argue, however, the mortgage deduction also discriminates between homeowners and renters. In the context of eliminating the deduction for state and local taxes, a taxpayer who lives in a high tax state may pay more in federal taxes if state taxes are not deductible.

An outright repeal of itemized deductions, or a repeal of particular deductions, would tend to simplify both tax filing and compliance by reducing record-keeping and auditing for those deductions and reducing the general determination of whether a tax filer should choose to itemize their deductions or claim the standard deduction. Some particular reforms might also simplify tax compliance and administration. For example, applying a floor to charitable deductions could eliminate the need for record-keeping for small donations that might also be less likely to be documented. Limits on contributions of property, such as household goods and clothing, could also reduce administrative costs because these items are hard to value and monitor. Limiting the deduction for appreciated assets to basis could improve the valuation of assets by encouraging taxpayers to sell assets and donate the proceeds.", "On the other hand, some approaches could add complications to tax compliance, by requiring additional computations. The proposal to limit the value of deductions, such as the President's proposal or FFM, could be particularly complicated for some tax filers as it could require computing tax liabilities under multiple additional scenarios, and perhaps re-computing the alternative minimum tax (AMT), depending on what or if modifications are made to that provision. Current rules, for example, may require three tax calculations for high-income taxpayers, the basic, an adjustment for dividends and capital gains, and for the AMT. The FFM proposal would require a separate computation to compare tax liability income, with and without deductions, to determine the limit on tax benefits, and these might also have to be coordinated with capital gains and dividends calculations, as well as the AMT. In addition, calculations compared with the standard deduction would have to be made, because it is less obvious which is better. One question that could be asked is whether producing a tax code in which tax liability may need to be calculated as many as eight different ways a desirable step in tax reform? ", "Although these tax computation problems could be minor with the use of tax preparation software, they still could complicate choices for individuals who prepare their own returns without software. Moreover, any type of aggregate ceiling or floor would complicate year-to-year decisions about charitable contributions, which are the most easily adjusted in the short run. Other complications may arise relating to charitable contributions. For example, in the case of revisions to the treatment of donated property, individuals wishing to donate property may now need to sell that property. These additional transactions may add complexity for them, although it may relieve the charities of that burden. Floors and ceilings could lead to shifting charitable contributions across tax years to minimize effects.", "In addition to administrative issues, there are also transitional issues. These issues are probably the most serious in the case of mortgage interest deductions, in which taxpayers entered into mortgages under the assumption of tax deductibility. Especially in the case of middle-income taxpayers, the presence and size of a mortgage is quite variable and may not be offset for many taxpayers with a rate reduction if mortgages are entirely eliminated. That is, since both itemizers and non-itemizers will face the same rates, tax burdens for current itemizers will rise even if the tax reform is distributionally neutral. Two solutions to these issues are to grandfather existing mortgages and only disallow the deduction of interest on new mortgages or to slowly lower the cap on mortgages over time. A second transitional issue, relating to owner occupied housing, is the potential short-run effect on an already troubled housing market. The solution might be slowly phasing down the caps."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Brief Overview of the Ways and Means Draft Tax Reform Proposals for Itemized Deductions", "paragraphs": ["On February 26, 2014, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Camp (MI) released a discussion draft for comprehensive tax reform legislation.

Some of the major changes to itemized deductions include the following:", "Home mortgage interest deduction : the cap on deductions for interest on the first $1 million in home mortgage value would be reduced to $500,000 in increments over three years. Also, deductions for interest on home equity loans would be repealed. Charitable contributions deduction : would generally be subject to a 2% of AGI floor. Gifts of property would generally be valued at their cost rather than fair market value. State and local tax deductions : would be repealed (e.g., property taxes, income taxes), except for state and local taxes accrued in a trade or business. Casualty loss deduction : would be repealed for personal casualty losses (i.e., losses not connected with a trade or business or entered into profit). Medical expenses deduction : would be repealed. Miscellaneous itemized deductions : several miscellaneous itemized deductions would be repealed, including deductions for tax preparation expenses. The 2% floor for miscellaneous deductions would also be repealed. Pease : would be repealed. ", "The House Ways and Means proposal intends to reduce the rate of tax filers who itemize from roughly one-third now to 5%, post-reform, through a combination of (1) increasing the standard deduction (from $12,400, married filing jointly in 2014 to $22,000, post-reform), and (2) eliminating or reforming the largest itemized deductions. If successful, then reductions in the rate of itemizers would increase the effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs) of tax filers, absent other changes, for the reasons explained in the \" Effects of Base-Broadening on Marginal Tax Rates, Labor Supply, and Saving \" and the \" Effects of Base-Broadening on Effective Marginal Tax Rates \" sections of this report. If these effects were taken into account in the macroeconomic analysis of the Ways and Means draft, then it is likely that the estimated, stimulative effect of tax reform would have been less than current estimates (and possibly negative) under dynamic scoring.", "As explained in the section on reforming \" Charitable Deductions ,\" the Ways and Means draft would increase the economic efficiency of the tax code with the 2% of AGI floor. Also, as discussed in that section, valuing property gifts at basis (generally their cost of acquisition) would eliminate the ability to avoid capital gains and receive a tax deduction. The Executive Summary for the legislation claims that the entire legislation would increase charitable giving by $2.2 billion per year by improving the health of the economy. This claim is suspect, however, because (1) the draft would reduce the number of tax filers itemizing, and reduce incentives to giving for middle- and upper-middle-income tax filers (whose aggregate deduction amounts are shown in Table A-2 ); and (2) the macroeconomic effect of tax reform is uncertain due to possible effects of increasing EMTRs on growth.

History of and Detailed Data on Itemized Deductions", "A Concise History of Itemized Deductions", "Itemized deductions have existed in some form since the creation of the first, permanent, U.S. income tax code in 1913. Tax filers have been able to itemize their deductions since the Revenue Act of 1913 (P.L. 63-16), which created the first permanent federal income tax. Deductions for interest paid or unexpected casualty losses were early provisions in the federal income tax code because many businesses were sole proprietorships (i.e., pass-through entities) in which the owner was personally liable for the costs of doing business.", "Tax deductions expanded during the post-World War II period between 1947 and the end of the 1970s. Itemized deductions were created for state and local taxes, certain forms of interest, charitable contributions, extraordinary health expenses, and miscellaneous expenses. As a share of personal income, these deductions grew from approximately 3.7% in 1947 to 10% in 1969, and then leveled off slightly to 9% in 1979. Some say that the growth of these itemized deductions was dampened, in part, due to increases in the standard deduction amount. The standard deduction, which was formerly based on a share of income instead of a set amount adjusted for inflation, grew from a postwar low of 2.4% of income in 1969 to 6.5% of income by 1979. This growth in the standard deduction reduced incentives for tax filers to itemize, because the value of the standard deduction exceeded the sum of their itemized deductions.", "The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA86) represented one of the most comprehensive tax code changes since the creation of the modern tax code in 1913. Among its main objectives, TRA86 sought to \"broaden the base\" of the individual income tax system, or expand the tax base without raising statutory tax rates, in a way that would provide an equitable distribution of tax reductions among individuals. With regard to the individual income tax code, TRA86 included reductions in marginal tax rates, reductions in the number of tax brackets, increase in the standard deduction, and the elimination or reformation of a variety of itemized deductions.", "Within this policy framework, TRA86 eliminated some tax deductions and reformed other deductions that were left in the tax code. Deductions for state and local sales taxes were eliminated and numerous other deductions (e.g., employee business expenses, travel, and entertainment, and unreimbursed medical expenses) were limited either through higher thresholds or partial disallowance. For example, TRA86 applied restrictions on the dollar amount of the home mortgage that was eligible for interest deduction ($1 million for married filing jointly/$500,000 for married filing separately), and limited the deduction only to a primary or secondary residence.", "Following TRA86, itemized deductions claims decreased in value by about one-quarter, dropping from 11.4% of personal income in 1985 to 9.2% by 1988. However, this decline in itemized deductions was partially offset in the tax base by a rise in the amount of tax filers claiming the standard deduction, whose value increased with the enactment of the TRA86.", "Since TRA86, Congress has authorized new itemized deductions. These individual provisions have been regularly reauthorized as part of a package of temporary \"tax extenders\" and are still in-effect under current law. For example, an option to deduct state and local sales taxes in lieu of state income taxes was enacted in 2004. In addition, qualified home mortgage insurance premiums became eligible for itemized deduction in 2007.", "Detailed Data on the Types of Itemized Deductions", "This section of the report presents data tables of how many tax filers claimed specific itemized deductions on their tax returns, and what amount they claimed for each itemized deduction.
