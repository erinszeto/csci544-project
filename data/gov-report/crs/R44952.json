Emergency planning notification requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA). The requirements are designed to promote emergency planning and preparedness at the state, local, and tribal levels.

EPCRA requires facilities to report the presence of hazardous chemicals or extremely hazardous substances to state and local emergency response officials, if the quantity present would exceed certain thresholds. This information is intended to assist state and local officials in developing their own emergency response plans in the event of an incident at a facility. The universe of facilities subject to reporting under EPCRA is larger than facilities subject to RMP requirements under the CAA, because EPCRA applies to a broader body of chemicals.", "Section 311 of EPCRA specifies the applicability of reporting requirements under that statute to hazardous chemicals that require the preparation of a material safety data sheet (MSDS) pursuant to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act). These hazardous chemicals encompass a broad array of substances commonly found in industrial, commercial, or other workplace settings. Considering this breadth, there is not a singular consolidated list. They are defined by certain characteristics and properties specified in federal regulations promulgated under the OSH Act. Certain uses of hazardous chemicals are excluded from reporting requirements, as outlined in Section 311(e) of EPCRA.", "Section 312 of EPCRA requires the owner or operator of a facility storing a hazardous chemical in a quantity equal to or exceeding 10,000 pounds to report the presence of the chemical to the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), the appropriate Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the local fire department with jurisdiction over the facility. States established SERCs and LEPCs pursuant to Section 301 of EPCRA.", "The general threshold of 10,000 pounds for the reporting of hazardous chemicals applies to \"Tier I\" reporting under which the facility owner or operator is required to report this information at its own initiative to the SERC, the appropriate LEPC, and the local fire department. There is a \"zero\" threshold (i.e., no minimum quantity) for \"Tier II\" reporting for which a SERC, LEPC, or local fire department may require additional information from the facility owner or operator about the presence of a hazardous chemical present at the facility.", "If a hazardous chemical also is designated under EPCRA as an extremely hazardous substance, the reporting threshold generally is 500 pounds, and may be less under separate reporting requirements. Section 302(a) of EPCRA directs EPA to determine which chemicals warrant designation as extremely hazardous substances and to establish separate reporting thresholds for them. In making these determinations, EPA must take into account the \"toxicity, reactivity, volatility, dispersability, combustability, or flammability\" of a substance. Section 302(c) of EPCRA requires the owner or operator of a facility storing an extremely hazardous substance exceeding the applicable threshold to report the presence of the substance to the SERC and the LEPC (but not the local fire department). Section 303(d) also requires facilities subject to the reporting of an extremely hazardous substance to designate a representative to serve on the LEPC.", "Section 324 of EPCRA requires information reported by facilities to SERCs, LEPCs, and local fire departments to be made available to the public, with the exception of facility information that may be subject to protection as confidential business or trade information. Section 322 of EPCRA specifies the types of confidential business or trade information that a facility owner or operator may choose to protect from public disclosure.

CERCLA requires a facility to report certain releases to the National Response Center to inform decisions about federal involvement in responding to the incident to coordinate with state and local officials. Section 107 of CERCLA also establishes liability for response costs and natural resource damages. Similar to emergency planning notification requirements discussed above, whether the owner or operator of a facility would be required under EPCRA or CERCLA to report an actual release into the environment would depend primarily on the quantity of the release.", "Section 103 of CERCLA generally requires persons who release hazardous substances into the environment to notify the federal National Response Center of the incident as soon as the person has knowledge of the release, if the quantity of the release is equal to or exceeds the threshold for that substance. Section 102 directed EPA to designate specific chemicals as hazardous substances for the purpose of CERCLA and to establish thresholds for reporting releases into the environment. A list of designated hazardous substances and the reporting threshold (i.e., reportable quantity) for each substance is specified in federal regulation. ", "In certain circumstances, a release may not be subject to reporting under CERCLA, even if the release otherwise would exceed the reportable quantity. Section 103 excludes federally permitted releases of hazardous substances from reporting requirements under the statute. Section 101(10) defines the term \"federally permitted release\" to include releases of hazardous substances authorized in permits issued under certain other federal environmental laws cited in that definition. Section 107(j) of CERCLA also exempts federally permitted releases from liability under the statute. Federally permitted releases are exempt from reporting requirements and liability under CERCLA based on the premise that permit requirements would address potential risks, and that the exemption may avoid potential conflicts between one federal law allowing a release and another imposing liability for the same action.", "Section 304 of EPCRA generally requires the owner or operator of a facility from which an extremely hazardous substance is released into the environment to report the release to the SERC and the appropriate LEPC, if the volume of the release is a reportable quantity.
