Presidential inauguration ceremonies are unique public events in the District of Columbia. The inauguration ceremonies are public and, like the President's State of the Union address, they are events in which a significant proportion of the American political leadership is in attendance. Consequently, the inauguration is designated as a National Special Security Event (NSSE) by the Department of Homeland Security. NSSEs are events that require significant security, in part because of the attendance of U.S. and foreign dignitaries and the event's public or official nature.", "Funding for inauguration security operations is provided from the U.S. Secret Service's National Special Security Event general account, though information on the amount provided is not publicly available. In limited circumstances, however, Congress has also provided supplemental appropriations to reimburse local jurisdictions for inauguration-related activities. Other inauguration spending is less easily identifiable because it is indirect and a part of typical annual appropriations to the relevant agencies. Because of the absence of specificity, substantive policy analysis on costs associated with inauguration security may be limited.", "In addition to Congress's responsibility for funding inauguration security operations, Congress also conducts oversight of the security operations. Criticisms of past inauguration security operations and practices generated congressional concern. An example of this criticism includes reports that some 2009 presidential inauguration ticket holders were unable to reach their designated seating areas due to security checkpoint contestation. Congressional, interest group, and media criticism appears to be specifically focused on 2009 inauguration security operations instead of general observations or criticism.

Presidential inaugurations are public events that are conducted primarily at the U.S. Capitol and on the grounds of the National Mall. Additionally, presidential inaugurations are ceremonies that are attended by a significant portion of the American political leadership. Due to safety and security concerns for the public and the American political leadership, the inauguration ceremony is designated a National Security Special Event (NSSE). NSSEs are high profile, and usually public, events that require significant security because of the attendance of U.S. and foreign dignitaries and the event's public or official nature. The United States Secret Service (USSS) is designated as the primary federal entity responsible for NSSE security. The USSS, however, is not the only law enforcement or first responder agency that has inauguration security responsibilities. The United States Capitol Police (USCP), the Metropolitan DC Police Department (MPD), the U.S. Park Police (USPP), and other law enforcement and first responder entities often assist the USSS and provide security for the swearing-in ceremony and other inaugural events.", "Congress appropriates funds for inauguration security. This funding is not always specifically identified for presidential inauguration security. Instead, inauguration security funding is expected to be provided from the USSS general NSSE account. In limited circumstances, Congress has provided supplemental appropriations to \"reimburse\" local jurisdictions for inauguration related activities. Not only does Congress provide funding for security operations, it also typically conducts oversight hearings following inaugurations to review these operations for future improvements.", "Criticism of past inauguration security operations and practices has generated congressional concern. For example, during the 2009 inauguration of President Barack Obama, some ticket holders were unable to reach their designated seating areas, while others were stuck in a tunnel leading to the National Mall. In a statement following the ceremony, Senator Dianne Feinstein, chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, asked for a review of inauguration security operations.", "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Inspector General (IG) completed a review for Congress and released its findings in October 2009. The IG's review focused on \"the adequacy of security ... and how well the Secret Service managed its after-action review.\" The report recommended that the USSS address areas identified for improvement and inform the IG's office when changes are implemented. Areas identified for improvement in the USSS after-action review, and reported on by the IG, included improving security planning, using new communications technology, and conducting additional after-action reports in an effort to improve logistics for off-site staging for future events. Due to what was reported to be successful security operations, the DHS IG was not asked to review the 2013 inauguration.", "This report provides information on inauguration security operations and inauguration security appropriations, and discusses potential policy issues associated with inauguration security operations.

To ensure consequence management, DHS prepositions Domestic Emergency Support Teams, Urban Search and Rescue Teams, national Emergency Response Teams, Nuclear Incident Response Teams, and the Strategic National Stockpile and Mobile Emergency Response System. Specific teams and groupings of teams are designed for each event based on unique characteristics of each event, coordination with other federal entities, state and local jurisdictions, available local resources, and mutual aid agreements.

For example, during past inaugurations, DHS and additional federal law enforcement agencies provided personnel and equipment, including screening magnetometers. In total, USSS received security assistance in the form of approximately 30,000 law enforcement officers from 58 federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies for multiple inaugural events.

Limited, and identified, appropriations for NSSE and the absence of specific inauguration security operations appropriations limits the ability to conduct substantive policy analysis on the costs associated with inaugurations generally, and inauguration security operations specifically.", "Since the 2001 inauguration of President George W. Bush, Congress has specifically appropriated funds to reimburse state and local entities for security costs associated with the inauguration. The appropriations ranged from approximately $6 million in 2001, to reimburse the District of Columbia, to a total of $22 million in 2009 to reimburse the National Park Service and state and local governments, including the District of Columbia, \"for extraordinary costs associated with the 2009 Presidential Inauguration.\" For the 2013 inauguration, Congress appropriated $9.8 million to the District of Columbia for \"emergency planning and security costs ... associated with the Presidential Inauguration,\" and for the 2017 inauguration, Congress appropriated $19.995 million for emergency planning and security costs in the District of Columbia.

Immediately following the inauguration, the USSS, USCP, MPD, and the USPP conducted a joint investigation and issued a report on March 17, 2009. This report identified crowd management and communication weaknesses, and made 38 recommendations to improve inauguration security operations; these are not, however, detailed in the publicly available report. The report provided recommendations such as establishing enhanced real time cell phone or Internet communications between security officials and the public and ticket holders. The other, less-publicized criticism appeared in a Washington Post article that cited six named and additional unnamed campaign donors who stated that security at the inauguration seemed lax. The Washington Post article, which was cited by the DHS IG, mentioned six concerns, including accounts that VIPs were not asked to show identification to receive tickets; public and ticketed attendees mingled among non-screened attendees and then returned to the screened ticketed area without re-screening; and VIPs leaned on the President-elect's limousine.

While presidential and vice-presidential visits are not NSSEs, local governments routinely ask for reimbursement for security and emergency service costs for these events. For example, in 2007, in preparation for Vice President Dick Cheney's visit to Coeur D'Alene, Idaho, the USSS requested ambulance and paramedic services for the Vice President's motorcade from the Northern Lakes Fire Protection District. Subsequently, it was reported that the fire district sought \"$2,087.79 for overtime costs and the expense of ambulances and fire trucks that had to remain on standby during the visit.\" While the fire district presumably could have declined to provide service, creating a standard reimbursement plan for presidential travel or an NSSE may provide an incentive for state and local jurisdictions. Further, having a procedure in place for reimbursement application would require the District of Columbia and other National Capital area jurisdictions to apply for inauguration related funds like any other local jurisdiction.", "Opponents of such a reimbursement program could cite issues in the evaluation of requests and deciding how to divide potentially limited funds. Each year, the President and Vice President attend many events. Providing reimbursement to every local jurisdiction could be expensive. Additionally, the quadrennial inauguration poses unique challenges for the National Capital Region.

Should Congress want to provide additional appropriations to the USSS and other federal law enforcement agencies for inauguration activities, it could provide additional appropriations during inauguration years. Providing additional appropriations for NSSEs during inaugural years, however, would potentially require Congress to specifically designate the funds for inauguration security.

Should Congress decide to provide an additional level of specificity, legislative language could be included in future inauguration year appropriations bills that specifically mention the inauguration and congressional intent for utilizing funds. Additional specificity would allow Congress to more closely monitor inauguration security spending. Providing detailed instructions, however, could also limit choices available to the USSS and other agencies that assist with inauguration security. Additional specificity could also raise concerns about the disclosure of detailed security arrangements to the public, potentially decreasing overall security.

To assist in offsetting costs associated with securing inaugural events, Congress could require that security costs for some events be covered partially or in full by PIC or another private entity. For example, since inaugural balls are ticketed events and not open to the public, Congress could require the event organizer or PIC to reimburse the government for the cost of security arrangements, in a similar arrangement to other presidential events. Securing the events in this manner could reduce the overall appropriations necessary for inauguration security. Requiring private funding of event security, however, could also be problematic. If the private entity is unable to raise sufficient funds, event security could become a liability. It could also result in fewer inauguration events and fewer locations for the USSS to secure.
