{"id": "R43440", "title": "The Volcker Rule: A Legal Analysis", "released_date": "2014-03-27T00:00:00", "summary": ["This report provides an introduction to the Volcker Rule, which is the regulatory regime imposed upon banking institutions and their affiliates under Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-203). The Volker Rule is designed to prohibit \"banking entities\" from engaging in all forms of \"proprietary trading\" (i.e., making investments for their own \"trading accounts\")\u2014activities that former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker often condemned as contrary to conventional banking practices and a potential risk to financial stability. The statutory language provides only general outlines of prohibited activities and exceptions. Through it, however, Congress has empowered five federal financial regulators with authority to conduct coordinated rulemakings to fill in the details and complete the difficult task of crafting regulations to identify prohibited activities, while continuing to permit activities considered essential to the safety and soundness of banking institutions or to the maintenance of strong capital markets. In December 2014, more than two years after enactment of the law, coordinated implementing regulations were issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).", "The Rule is premised on a two-pronged central core restricting activities by \"banking entities\"\u2014a term that includes all FDIC-insured bank and thrift institutions; all bank, thrift, or financial holding companies; all foreign banking operations with certain types of presence in the United States; and all affiliates and subsidiaries of any of these entities. Specifically, the Rule broadly prohibits banking entities from engaging in \"proprietary trading\" and from making investments in or having relationships with hedge and similar \"covered funds\" that are exempt from registering with the CFTC as commodity pool operators or with the SEC under the Investment Advisors Act. The Rule couples its broad prohibitions with numerous exclusions and by designating myriad activities as permissible so long as various terms and conditions are met, unless they otherwise would involve or result in a material conflict of interest; a material exposure to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies; pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the banking entity; or pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.", "The exceptions to the ban on proprietary trading include underwriting by securities underwriters; market-making \"designed not to exceed the reasonably expected near term demands of clients\"; trading in government securities; fiduciary activities; insurance company portfolio investments; and risk-mitigating hedging activities. The ban on investing in and owning \"covered funds\" exempts certain types of funds, under specified conditions, and permits de minimis investment in any such fund up to 3% of the outstanding ownership interests of the fund with an aggregate cap on the total ownership interest in \"covered funds\" of 3% of the banking entity's core capital.", "To prevent evasion, the Rule has extensive requirements mandating comprehensive compliance programs that include ongoing management involvement, precise metrics measuring risk assessment, verification and documentation of any activities conducted under one of the Rule's exceptions or exclusions, and recurring reports and assessments. Full compliance is required by July 21, 2015, subject to the possibility that further extensions may be provided by the regulators. In the case of investments involving \"illiquid funds\" subject to contractual provisions seriously impacting their marketability or sale, full divestiture might not be required until July 21, 2022."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Volcker Rule: Dodd-Frank Act \u00a7619", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["On December 10, 2013, more than two years after the statutorily mandated deadline, five federal financial regulators published final regulations (hereinafter, the regulations) implementing Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (hereinafter, Section 619 or the statute). Together these are known as the Volcker Rule (hereinafter, the Volcker Rule or the Rule), which is designed to prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in risky, short-term, speculative trading and investing in private equity and hedge funds. These are practices long condemned by the Rule's namesake, former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker, for being at odds with conventional banking principles and potential risks to overall financial stability that could trigger the need for future bailouts. ", "The same day that the regulations were issued, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) set the date when conformance with the Rule is required as July 21, 2015, although that date could be extended an additional two years, and banking institutions and their affiliates are under an obligation to undertake good faith efforts to meet that date with full compliance. ", "The Volcker Rule, which according to an analysis by one of the issuing regulators might impose significant costs on covered institutions, prohibits \"banking entities\" from engaging in \"proprietary trading\" and from making investments in or having relationships with hedge and similar \"covered funds\" that fall into certain exemptions from registering with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as commodity pool operators or with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Investment Advisors Act. In concert with these broad prohibitions, the Rule carves out numerous exclusions and designates myriad activities as permissible so long as various terms and conditions are met. The statutory language provides only general outlines of prohibited activities and exceptions, while empowering the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the SEC, and CFTC (together, the federal financial regulators or the Agencies) to issue coordinated rulemakings to fill in the details and complete the difficult task of crafting regulations to distinguish prohibited activities from activities considered essential to the safety and soundness of banking institutions or to the maintenance of strong capital markets.", "What follows is a legal overview of the Volcker Rule. The report begins by analyzing the integral definition of \"banking entity,\" which serves as the foundation for the applicability of the Rule. It then separately analyzes the two distinct components of the Rule: (1) restrictions on proprietary trading; and (2) restrictions on investing in and sponsoring covered funds. The basic framework of the Rule is to broadly prohibit banking entities from engaging in these two broad categories of activities, while also carving out specific exclusions from the scope of the two categories and exceptions for certain activities that otherwise would generally fall within the broad prohibitions. These excepted activities are designated as permissible under the Rule unless they would involve or result in a material conflict of interest; a material exposure to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies; pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the banking entity; or pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States. The report concludes by addressing other aspects of the Rule that apply generally to banking entities, including various compliance programs and reporting and recordkeeping obligations designed to implement the statute's anti-evasion provisions, as well as the requirements for divesting of legacy holdings and activities that do not conform with the Rule."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Statutory Delegation to the Financial Regulators", "paragraphs": ["Congress has delegated extensive discretion to the federal financial regulators to craft the Volcker Rule to meet a list of widely divergent objectives. The statute states the prohibitions and conditions in very broad terms and applies them to an array of financial institutions subject to a variety of regulatory regimes and separate regulators, foreign and domestic. It applies to community and global banks, every variety of insurance firm, securities firms, and foreign banking institutions operating in the United States, among others. The federal financial regulators have been tasked with diverse objectives, among which are the following: promoting safety and soundness of the entities covered by the Rule; protecting taxpayers and consumers; limiting inappropriate transfers of the safety net provided by FDIC deposit insurance; reducing conflicts of interests between the entities and their clients; limiting unduly risky activities by these entities; \"appropriately\" accommodating the business of insurance; and \"appropriately\" timing divestiture of illiquid assets affected by the Rule. ", "The statutory language requires the regulators to explicate such critical terms as \"banking entity,\" \"covered fund,\" \"illiquid fund,\" \"trading account,\" \"hedge fund,\" \"reasonably expected near term demands of clients,\" \"specific risks,\" and \"ownership interest.\" It includes a broad explicit delegation of discretion to exclude from the basic prohibitions of the statute \"[s]uch other activity as the appropriate [federal financial regulators] determine, by rule ... would promote and protect the safety and soundness of the banking entity and the financial stability of the United States.\" ", "Consequently, the Volcker Rule is not likely to remain static over time. Rather, regulators likely will modify and clarify the requirements through regulations and guidance to address unforeseen complexities. In fact, as is discussed in the \"Definition of 'Ownership Interest'\" section of this report, the regulators have already issued an interim final rule that makes changes to the regulations as originally issued on December 10, 2013."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Applicability\u2014\"Banking Entities\"", "paragraphs": ["The thrust of the Volcker Rule's restrictions applies to \"banking entities.\" \"Banking entity\" is defined as:", "1. FDIC-insured depository institutions. T his includes national and state banks, federal and state savings associations, thrifts, and similarly chartered banking institutions that offer FDIC-insured deposits. 2. Companies that own FDIC-insured depository institutions. This includes companies that own or control FDIC-insured depositories (by holding a certain percentage of voting stock or otherwise exerting a controlling influence over a company's decision making, such as the election of directors). Such companies are typically organized as bank holding companies (BHCs), financial holding companies (FHCs), or savings and loan or thrift holding companies. 3. Foreign-based companies that are treated like bank holding companies pursuant to the International Banking Act of 1978. This includes foreign-based banks that are permitted to operate branches in the U.S. or that own certain other domestic lending companies. An affiliate is \"any company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with [a company described in categories 1-3].\" 4. Affiliates and subsidiaries of companies described in 1-3. This covers \"any company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with [a company described in categories 1-3].\" ", "In short, the Volcker Rule applies broadly to all depository institutions and to most companies that are owned by or have a common ownership interest with a depository. As a result, the Volcker Rule applies to the approximately 10,000 \"community banks\" scattered across the country. On the other side of the spectrum, the Volcker Rule applies to global financial conglomerates like Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs, which are organized as FHCs and thus control at least one FDIC-insured depository institution. The rule also generally applies to hundreds of depository and non-depository affiliates and subsidiaries of these FHCs. However, the regulations provide certain exceptions to the definition of \"banking entity,\" as discussed below. ", "Additionally, the applicability of certain exemptions, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, and other aspects of the Rule vary to some degree according to the organization or typical activities of a particular banking entity. For example, because they may engage in little or no activities that are banned by the Volcker Rule, the recordkeeping and reporting requirements and other compliance standards that apply to community banks and their subsidiaries and affiliates generally will not be as onerous as those imposed on the country's largest FHCs. As another example, foreign banks and foreign affiliates of U.S. banking entities under certain circumstances will be permitted to trade foreign government obligations, but these activities generally are prohibited under the Volcker Rule's ban on proprietary trading for U.S.-based banking entities and U.S.-based affiliates of foreign banks."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Restrictions on Proprietary Trading", "paragraphs": ["The Volcker Rule establishes an outright prohibition on proprietary trading by a \"banking entity.\" Subsequent provisions of the legislation, however, provide activities that are excluded from the definition of \"proprietary trading,\" as well as exceptions to the general ban as long as various conditions are met. The exact language provides a broad prohibition. It reads, \"a banking entity shall not \u2026 engage in proprietary trading, ...\" Under the statute, \"proprietary trading\" covers buying and selling of \"financial instruments\" by banking entities as \"principal\" for their \"trading accounts.\" \"Financial instruments\" include securities, derivatives, and contracts for future sale or for options on any commodity other than foreign exchange or currency, but not loans. However, as described more fully below, certain types of financial instruments and operations are excluded.", "The regulation focuses on restricting short-term trades. It establishes a rebuttable presumption that any financial instrument held for fewer than 60 days is a banned proprietary trade unless all relevant facts and circumstances rebut the presumption. It defines \"trading account\" as any account used to buy or sell one or more financial instruments \"principally\" for \"short-term resale,\" to benefit from \"short-term price movements,\" to realize \"short-term arbitrage profits,\" or to hedge any of these. \"Trading account\" also covers trades by banking entities that are securities dealers and swap or swap-based securities dealers\u2014both in the United States and abroad\u2014as well as market risk capital transactions and hedges of such transactions by banking entities that calculate such ratios under the banking agencies' Market Risk Capital Rules."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Exclusions from Definition of \"Proprietary Trading.\"", "paragraphs": ["The Rule, embodied in the regulations, expressly provides that certain activities are not included in the definition of \"proprietary trading,\" including the following: ", "acquisitions or sales of financial products pursuant to a repurchase and reverse repurchase agreement; acquisitions or sales of financial products pursuant to a securities lending agreement; acquisitions or sales of \"highly liquid\" securities as part of a valid liquidity management plan, which \"the banking entity does not reasonably expect to give rise to appreciable profits or losses as a result of short-term price movements\"; various derivative clearing activities; acquisitions or sales of financial products for the satisfaction of delivery obligations, such as in connection with a judicial or administrative proceeding; acquisitions or sales of financial products \"by a banking entity acting solely as agent, broker, or custodian\"; acquisitions or sales of financial products while acting as a trustee for an employee compensation plan; and acquisitions or sales of financial products in the \"ordinary course of collecting a debt,\" as long as the products are divested \"as soon as practicable.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Permitted Proprietary Activities", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the above exclusions from the definition of \"proprietary trading,\" the Rule identifies exceptions to the blanket prohibition of proprietary trades by listing permitted activities and setting conditions under which those activities may be conducted. However, it excludes from permitted activities any transaction or class of activities, otherwise permitted, that would involve or result in a material conflict of interest, a material exposure by the banking entity to \"high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies\" as defined by the regulators, or a threat to safety and soundness of the banking entity or to the financial stability of the United States. It provides standards by which the regulators may set further limits or conditions on these activities and includes authority for the regulators to add to the list of permitted activities. The regulators may impose additional capital and quantitative limits as \"appropriate to protect the safety and soundness of banking entities engaged in such activities.\" ", "Subject to those conditions, the exceptions or permitted activities are:", "Underwriting Activities. The statute's ban on proprietary trading does not apply to a banking entity's underwriting activities so long as its underwriting position is \"designed not to exceed the reasonably expected near term demands of clients, customers, or counterparties.\" The regulations further stipulate that, to be permissible, such underwriting activities must be related to the banking entity's role as a securities underwriter, the banking entity must have an internal compliance program, and certain other requirements must be met. Market Making Activities. The statute's ban on proprietary trading does not apply to a banking entity's \"market making activities, to the extent that any such activities ... are designed not to exceed the reasonably expected near term demands of clients.... \" In devising the provisions in the regulations regarding permissible market making, the agencies sought to provide covered institutions sufficient flexibility to engage in the full scope of current \"market making-related activities\" provided there are \"clearly defined, verifiable, and monitored risk parameters.\" The regulation's requirements include that \"[t]he amount, types, and risks of the financial instruments ... are designed not to exceed, on an ongoing basis, the reasonably expected near term demands of clients, customers, or counterparties\"; the banking entity \"routinely stands ready to purchase and sell ... financial instruments ... in commercially reasonable amounts and throughout market cycles on a basis appropriate for the liquidity, maturity, and depth of the market ... \"; and, that, in addition to other criteria, the banking entity has an internal compliance program. Whether the goal of the agencies for flexibility sufficient to maintain robust capital markets has been achieved, particularly with respect to some specialty markets with limited participants, awaits time and experience. Risk Mitigating Hedging Activities . The statute authorizes \"[r]isk-mitigating hedging activities\" that are \"related to individual or aggregated positions ... that are designed to reduce the specific risks to the banking entity in connection with and related to such positions.... \" The regulations track the language of the statute and permit \"risk-mitigating hedging activities\" that are \"positions, contracts, or other holdings of the banking entity and designed to reduce specific risks to the banking entity in connection with and related to such ... holdings.\" The final rule seeks to make it clear that portfolio hedging will not be permitted; banking entities will be required to document any investment undertaken as a hedge by linking it to the specific risks or exposures being offset. This provision is aimed at preventing incidents like the $6 billion loss that JPMorgan & Co. suffered in 2012 as a result of derivatives trades, designed to hedge against risks of the entire financial conglomerate, which were conducted by a trader known as the London Whale and which were documented in a Senate investigation. Government and GSE Obligations . The statute authorizes the purchase and sale of U.S. obligations; obligations of federal agencies; obligations of Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Federal Home Loan Banks, Farmer Mac, and Farm Credit System institutions; and obligations of any state or political subdivision of a state. Under the regulations, banking entities may purchase and sell \"any municipal security\" and other domestic government obligations without running afoul of the prohibition against proprietary trading. Although foreign governments lobbied the financial regulators to include a similarly broad exclusion for foreign government obligations, under the final regulations, foreign banks and foreign affiliates of U.S. banks under certain circumstances will be permitted to trade foreign government obligations, but U.S. banks and U.S.-based affiliates of foreign banks generally may not. Fiduciary Activities. The ban on proprietary trading does not apply to a banking entity's fiduciary activities that are conducted on behalf a customer and where the banking entity does not acquire a beneficial interest in the associated financial instruments. Riskless Principal Transactions. Riskless principal transactions, where a banking entity buys or sells a financial product \"to offset a contemporaneous sale or purchase\" of a customer, are exempt from the Volcker Rule's ban on proprietary trading. Insurance Company Portfolio Investments. The statute permits trading by insurance companies for their general accounts. Under the regulation, a banking entity that is an insurance company or an affiliate of an insurance company is permitted to buy or sell financial instruments for its own account if the transaction \"is conducted in compliance with, and subject to, the insurance company investments laws\" of the applicable state. However, the relevant federal banking regulators, in consultation with the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and relevant state or foreign insurance regulators, may jointly proscribe otherwise permissible insurance company investment activities if the state regulation of those activities \"is insufficient to protect the safety and soundness of the banking entity or the financial stability of the United States.\" Proprietary Trading by Foreign Companies Conducted Outside the United States. The statute authorizes investments permitted under Sections 4(c)(9) and 4(c)(13) of the Bank Holding Company Act, provided they are conducted solely outside the United States by a banking entity that is not \"controlled by a banking entity organized under the laws of the United States or of one or more States.\" The regulation also includes various other restrictions. In the preamble accompanying the final regulations, the agencies stated that these conditions have been structured \"to ensure that any foreign banking entity engaging in trading activity under this exemption does so in a manner that ensures the risk, decision-making, arrangement, negotiation, execution and financing of the activity resides solely outside the United States and limits the risk to the U.S. financial system from trades by foreign banking entities with or through U.S. entities.\" Other Investments . The statute provides the agencies with discretion to permit proprietary trading for any other activity that they \"determine, by rule, ... would permit promote and protect the safety soundness of the banking entity and the financial stability of the United States.\" The agencies used this broad authority to define the scope of the permissible trading by foreign banking entities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Limitation on Relationships with Hedge Funds, Private Equity Funds, and Other \"Covered Funds\"", "paragraphs": ["The Volcker Rule regulations broadly prohibit banking entities from, \"directly or indirectly, acquir[ing] or retain[ing] any ownership interest in or sponsor[ing] a covered fund,\" as principal for its own account, rather for a customer.

For example, as a result of the definition of ownership, certain collateralized debt obligations (CDO) backed by trust preferred securities (TruPS), a type of financial instrument that many banking entities, particularly community banks, used as a way to raise capital, generally was a prohibited investment under the original Volcker Rule regulations, and thus would have to be divested. The American Bankers Association and several community banking organizations promptly filed a lawsuit challenging this aspect of the financial regulators' interpretation of the Volcker Rule. The financial regulators responded by issuing an interim final rule on January 14, 2014, that will serve as a companion to the December 10 Volcker Rule regulations, establishing terms and conditions by which banking entities will be permitted to continue to hold interests in and sponsor a CDO (or similar investment vehicle) backed by TruPS. Shortly after the regulators issued the interim final rules, the plaintiffs withdrew their lawsuit. ", "While the focus of the interim final rule is on TruPS issued and held by community banking organizations, similar issues likely exist regarding the applicability of the Volcker Rule to securities, issued and held by banking entities both large and small, that are backed by other types of debts, such as commercial paper, automobile loans, and mortgages."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Definition of \"Covered Fund\"", "paragraphs": ["The Volcker Rule regulations define \"covered fund\" to largely encompass entities that are exempt from various registration requirements with either the SEC or CFTC, as well as certain foreign funds.
