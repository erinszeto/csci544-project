For these grandfathered dietary supplement ingredients, manufacturers are required to maintain records that document their use prior to October 15, 1994. As long as documentation of grandfathered status exists, a product may be marketed without any evidence of efficacy or safety of its ingredients. The manufacturer of a NDI marketed after that date must give 75 days' premarket notification to the FDA, and must provide a history of use or other evidence of safety when used under recommended conditions. ", "Prior to enactment of DSHEA in 1994, manufacturers were not required by law to notify the FDA of dietary supplement ingredients. Congress created a requirement for manufacturers to notify the FDA of NDI in DSHEA. There is, however, no list of dietary supplement ingredients that were on the market prior to that date. FSMA, enacted in December 2010, contained a provision requiring the FDA to clarify the definition of a NDI and to explain the requirements for safety evaluation of a NDI within 180 days of enactment. The FDA published draft NDI guidance on July 5, 2011. The draft guidance generated controversy, with some manufacturers expressing concerns that the proposed guidance was burdensome and not in keeping with DSHEA. In response to those concerns, the FDA agreed in June 2012 to revise the guidance. FDA has not proposed a timeline for the revised guidance.

Dietary supplement-specific GMP were requested by industry, citing concerns that GMP developed for conventional food products did not adequately address the unique characteristics of dietary supplements. These regulations were finalized in 2007, and largely addressed the concerns raised by the industry. Dietary supplement GMPs contain sections that detail additional quality control procedures and recordkeeping requirements for each step in the manufacturing process. Following GMP should ensure that final products do not include the wrong ingredients; too much or too little of a dietary ingredient; contaminants such as natural toxins, bacteria, pesticides, glass, lead or other heavy metals; or improper packaging or labeling.

Dietary supplements are required to have a supplement facts panel (as opposed to a nutrition facts panel for conventional foods). Dietary supplement labels may display certain claims, discussed in detail below, but they must also display a standard disclaimer, and must not link the supplement or its ingredients to the treatment of a specific medical condition. The FDA's Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide sets forth the general display (principal display panel, or PDP) and placement requirements of dietary supplement labeling.

This system was designed to (1) detect adverse events; (2) generate and assess signals of potential public health concerns; (3) take appropriate actions based on these assessments. However, according to HHS' Office of the Inspector General (OIG), that system provided inadequate data on adverse events, due to its voluntary nature and limited scope. In 2001, an OIG report concluded that the reporting system detected relatively few adverse events, lacked adequate information to assess possible health concerns, and contained limited medical, product, and consumer information.", "The Dietary Supplement and Non-Prescription Drug Consumer Protection Act, enacted in 2006, required several changes to the adverse event reporting system for dietary supplements.

FDA has estimated that, due to significant underreporting, the annual number of adverse events linked to dietary supplements may be 50,000. This may be because consumers may not consistently report adverse events to the FDA, and/or they may be contacting poison control centers which generally do not send information about adverse events to the FDA.

However, if it appears to be a conventional food marketed as a dietary supplement, the FDA can challenge this decision. Because the decision is made by the manufacturer, there are concerns that some energy drinks are being marketed as dietary supplements in order to circumvent the required standards for food additives and GRAS substances (such as caffeine) in conventional foods. Conversely, there may also be benefits to marketing an energy drink as a conventional food. For example, a popular energy drink manufacturer recently changed labeling on its product to market it as a beverage. When marketing it as a beverage, the manufacturer is not required to report serious adverse events associated with its product. Additionally, as a beverage the energy drink is able to be purchased with food stamps. ", "In a 2010 report, GAO recommended the FDA issue guidance to clarify when products should be marketed as dietary supplements or as conventional foods. FDA agreed with this recommendation; to date, it has issued draft guidance on distinguishing liquid dietary supplements from beverages. Industry representatives have raised several concerns about the draft guidance and have requested clarification from the FDA.

These reports do not investigate causality or prove any direct link between energy drinks and these illnesses, and manufacturers deny any link between their products and these events. Additionally, the reports may not include adverse event reports to energy drink manufacturers who market their energy drinks as beverages, because adverse event reporting is not mandatory for other food manufacturers. If the FDA were to classify all energy drinks as dietary supplements, reporting of serious adverse events would be mandatory for all energy drink manufacturers. These reports have placed the issues of energy drink classification and their ingredients, and the government's role in regulating their manufacture and marketing, into the spotlight.

However, some physicians recommend dietary supplements to their patients based on the available literature, and still more patients take supplements based on their own research and concerns. ", "The federal government and the dietary supplement industry have taken steps to address consumer and health care provider understanding of dietary supplements through investment in research and the promotion of industry standards. The NIH and Department of Defense (DOD) have created websites and mobile applications to provide consumers with dietary supplement information. Some physicians' associations, such as the American Association of Endocrinologists, have published guidelines for the clinical use of dietary supplements, grading the quality and availability of evidence for each supplement reviewed. Industry groups have also initiated development of guidelines for use. ", "Past Congresses have introduced legislation that would allow dietary supplement manufacturers to make claims that would be considered drug-like. Some research has shown that, if dietary supplements could be proven to be safe and effective in the prevention and/or treatment of specific health conditions through scientific research, and those benefits were accurately conveyed to consumers, use of those supplements could possibly yield cost savings for consumers. Conversely, the cost of conducting and documenting the research required to prove health related claims to the FDA (such as randomized, controlled trials) in addition to proving safety for each product could affect the cost of the supplement to consumers. Industry has noted this in comments to the FDA. Currently, whether or not certain supplements are effective, they may still have an effect on the health care system if they keep a patient out of a doctor's office (although this could have either a positive or negative outcome, in terms of both cost and health).", "As the popularity of dietary supplements continues to grow, some patients and industry advocates are pushing for certain supplements to be treated as medical care for the purposes of health savings account eligibility. Advocates of this approach argue that supplements are being used to enhance the health and well-being of individuals, and in theory maintain consumers' health, and thus should be eligible for purchase with funds from health care savings accounts. Some employer-sponsored health care savings accounts currently allow dietary supplements as an eligible expense in certain circumstances."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Dietary Supplement Safety", "paragraphs": ["Regardless of the form or the reasons for which they are consumed, there is consensus that dietary supplements consumed by Americans should be safe and effective. However, there remains disagreement on how to achieve the goals of safety and efficacy. According to public opinion polls, the American public overwhelmingly assumes that FDA reviews the safety and effectiveness of dietary supplements before they are marketed. While this is the case for drugs and some medical devices, it is not the case for dietary supplements. ", "As noted earlier in this report, the FDA has the authority to regulate dietary supplements once they are on the market, and can inspect facilities to ensure compliance with GMP; ensure proper labeling and use of claims; and monitor adverse event reports. Additionally, the FTC monitors dietary supplement advertising for compliance with its guidelines. The dietary supplement industry has also taken steps toward self-regulation, by developing industry standards of quality and safety and creating third-party certification programs.", "FDA's interpretation of its authorities through the rulemaking process is a source of disagreement between FDA and the dietary supplement industry. For example, industry advocates have argued that FDA's draft NDI regulations undermine DSHEA because the FDA is now holding dietary supplements to the same safety standards as food additives, which was not Congress' intent. They have also expressed concerns about duplicative submissions, the level of safety data required, and the definition of grandfathered ingredients. Public health advocates argue that scientific evidence is necessary to demonstrate product safety, as these products continue to grow in popularity and usage. However, industry advocates believe the cost of proving NDI safety will be too burdensome, and will cause some manufacturers to drop production of certain supplements. Some Members of Congress concur, and have written the FDA urging the agency to rewrite the NDI guidance in a manner that would not increase barriers to market entry for new dietary supplement companies and products. ", "Some argue that FDA's ability to identify safety concerns associated with dietary supplements is undermined by a lack of scientific information that is available for other regulated products, such as drugs. Industry representatives argue that most dietary supplement ingredients have a history of safe use in humans, and therefore should not be held to the same standard as drugs, and that newer additions to the supplement market will be required to go through the NDI notification process. For adulterated and some misbranded products, the FDA now has mandatory recall authority (as of FSMA), although the burden of proof remains on the FDA. In the past, the process for FDA to prove a significant or unreasonable risk was lengthy. For example, it took the FDA 10 years to amass enough data to meet the statutory burden of proof for banning Ephedra from the market. ", "Some have claimed that FDA's current enforcement policies overstep the agency's authority and violate the First Amendment, while others have deemed the agency's enforcement policies \"anemic.\" Past inspections by the FDA have found dietary supplements that contain undeclared or deceptively labeled ingredients. These products are often promoted for weight loss, sexual enhancement, and bodybuilding. FSMA provided FDA the authority to notify the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) when it determines that an NDI may contain an anabolic steroid or its analogue. In response to recent findings, the FDA wrote a letter to industry communicating its legal obligation and responsibility to prevent tainted products from reaching the U.S. market, highlighting a new rapid public notification system to warn consumers about those products and a mechanism for manufacturers to notify FDA about potentially tainted products. FDA has publicly warned consumers about these products and had provided consumer information bulletins on how to consider whether a supplement is safe or not. ", "Despite new FDA post-market authorities and industry standard and certification programs, the public is still faced with examples of inconsistent potency and quality (including that of compounded dietary supplements, which are currently not subject to GMP) , unsubstantiated claims made by manufacturers, and illegal or unapproved ingredients that render supplements adulterated. For example, the FDA recently issued a number of warning letters to manufacturers who may not be following the NDI guidelines. In April 2012, the agency issued warning letters to 10 dietary supplement manufacturers for marketing products containing dimethylamylamine (DMAA) without submitting an NDI notification. Plaintiffs have used these warning letters to bring lawsuits against those companies. ", "FDA has taken steps in recent years to address oversight of dietary supplement safety. Enforcement of existing laws and regulations is generally restricted by funding, and the agency's discretionary budget authority has remained relatively flat in recent years. The agency also has increased regulatory responsibilities under FSMA. Despite these potential constraints, the increased awareness of issues due to mandatory serious adverse event reporting has led the FDA to increase dietary supplement facility inspections and other enforcement actions since 2008. ", "Industry groups and other advocates have historically challenged regulations that are perceived to overstep FDA's authority under the FFDCA. Legislative action often moves forward once industry, Congress, and the FDA achieve consensus. For example, adverse event reporting was strengthened once Congress, scientific advisory committees, industry, and consumers established consensus on the issue, and the mandatory recall authority proffered by FSMA was also supported by industry representatives."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Comments", "paragraphs": ["Consumers, the health care and dietary supplement industries, Congress, and federal regulators all have a stake in supplement identification, effectiveness, and safety.
