In the final rule, however, DOE agreed to guarantee up to 100% of debt, but only for loans issued by the Federal Financing Bank.", "Title XVII requires the estimated future government costs resulting from defaults on guaranteed loans to be covered up-front by appropriations or by payments from project sponsors (borrowers). These \"subsidy costs\" are calculated as the present value of the average possible future net costs to the government for each loan guarantee, on a case-by-case basis. If those calculations are accurate, the subsidy cost payments for all the guaranteed projects together should cover the future costs of the program. However, the Congressional Budget Office has predicted that the up-front subsidy cost payments will prove too low by at least 1% and is scoring bills accordingly. As a result, appropriations bills that provide loan guarantee authorizations include an adjustment totaling 1% of the loan guarantee ceiling.", "Subsidy costs for Section 1703 loan guarantees must usually be paid by project sponsors, because no appropriations for that program were provided before FY2011 (as described below). However, ARRA appropriated $6 billion to cover the subsidy costs of Section 1705 loan guarantees, so subsidy cost payments are not required from project sponsors under that program. The total loan guarantee amounts that could be provided under ARRA depend on the level of subsidy costs that would be charged. For example, if the subsidy costs averaged 10% of the total guaranteed loans, then $6 billion in subsidy cost appropriations would support $60 billion in loan guarantees. However, $2 billion of Section 1705 subsidy cost appropriation was subsequently transferred to the \"cash for clunkers\" automobile trade-in program by P.L. 111-47 , and another $1.5 billion was rescinded to help pay for the Education Jobs and Medicaid Assistance Act ( P.L. 111-226 ), leaving $2.5 billion. Of the $2.5 billion available for subsidy costs, $1.9 billion had been obligated by the end of FY2011.", "DOE's first loan guarantee under Section 1705 was issued in September 2009 to Solyndra Inc., a manufacturer of photovoltaic equipment. Solyndra's bankruptcy announcement on August 31, 2011, prompted strong congressional criticism of the Administration's management of the loan guarantee program. Solyndra's DOE loan guarantee totaled $535 million, and the company's bankruptcy placed most or all of that amount at risk.", "Under the Federal Credit Reform Act (FCRA), federal loan guarantees cannot be provided without an authorized level in an appropriations act. The Senate-passed version of omnibus energy legislation in the 110 th Congress ( H.R. 6 ) would have explicitly eliminated FCRA's applicability to DOE's planned loan guarantees under EPACT05 (\u00a7124(b)). That provision would have given DOE essentially unlimited loan guarantee authority for guarantees whose subsidy costs were paid by project sponsors, but it was dropped from the final legislation ( P.L. 110-140 ). Similar language has been included in subsequent legislative proposals, but not enacted.", "Pursuant to FCRA, the FY2007 continuing resolution ( P.L. 110-5 ) established an initial cap of $4 billion on loan guarantees under the program, without allocating that amount among the various eligible technologies. The explanatory statement for the FY2008 omnibus funding act ( P.L. 110-161 ) increased the loan guarantee ceiling to $38.5 billion through FY2009, including $18.5 billion specifically for nuclear power plants and $2 billion for uranium enrichment plants.", "The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act ( P.L. 111-8 ) increased DOE's total loan guarantee authority under Section 1703 to $47 billion, in addition to the $4 billion authorized in FY2007, half of which DOE has designated for uranium enrichment. Of the $47 billion, $18.5 billion continued to be reserved for nuclear power, $18.5 was for energy efficiency and renewables, $6 billion was for coal, $2 billion was for carbon capture and sequestration, and $2 billion was for uranium enrichment. The time limits on the Section 1703 loan guarantee authority were eliminated. The FY2011 Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act ( P.L. 112-10 ) reduced the previous loan guarantee authority for Section 1703 non-nuclear technologies to $8.3 billion but added new authority for a total of $9.5 billion. Including the $2 billion in FY2007 authority that has not been designated for uranium enrichment, the Section 1703 non-nuclear loan guarantee ceiling stands at about $11.5 billion. Nuclear loan guarantees remain at $18.5 billion, and uranium enrichment totals $4 billion.", "Remaining appropriations for subsidy cost payments under the Section 1705 loan guarantee program expired at the end of FY2011, as noted above. However, the FY2011 Continuing Appropriations Act provided $170 million, with no expiration, to pay subsidy costs for renewable energy and efficiency projects under the Section 1703 program. The act also provided authority for up to $1.183 billion in loan guarantees for those renewable energy and efficiency projects, in addition to the $32.8 billion in Section 1703 authority remaining from earlier appropriations acts for all technologies. The additional loan guarantee authority and subsidy cost appropriation provided by the FY2011 Continuing Appropriations Act is available to projects that applied under the expiring Section 1705 before February 24, 2011.", "Following is a summary of the various elements of the current DOE loan guarantee program, as modified by the FY2011 Continuing Appropriations Act (CR):", "$8.3 billion ceiling in CR on non-nuclear technologies under Section 1703 ($317 million conditionally committed), reduced from ceilings set in FY2009. $2 billion for unspecified projects from FY2007 under Section 1703, not affected by CR. $18.5 billion ceiling for nuclear power plants ($8.3 billion conditionally committed). $4 billion allocated for loan guarantees for uranium enrichment plants ($2 billion conditionally committed). $1.183 billion ceiling for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects under Section 1703, in addition to other ceiling amounts, which can include pending applications under Section 1705. An appropriation of $170 million for subsidy costs for renewable energy and energy efficiency loan guarantees under Section 1703. If the subsidy costs averaged 10% of the loan guarantees, this funding could support loan guarantees totaling $1.7 billion. $2.5 billion for Section 1705 subsidy costs appropriated by ARRA. As noted above, about $1.9 billion of this funding was used to pay the subsidy costs for $16.13 billion in loan guarantees with final commitments under Section 1705, for which the deadline was September 30, 2011.", "DOE requested an additional appropriation of $200 million in FY2012 to cover the subsidy costs of innovative renewable energy and energy efficiency projects under Section 1703. That funding would support about $1-2 billion in loan guarantees, according to the budget justification. DOE also repeated its unsuccessful request from FY2011 to nearly triple the ceiling on loan guarantees for nuclear power projects, from $18.5 billion to $54.5 billion. The FY2012 House bill would have appropriated $160 million for subsidy costs under Section 1703 and for projects that applied for support under Section 1705 before February 24, 2011. The House bill did not include the proposed $36 billion increase in the nuclear loan guarantee ceiling. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the full $200 million request for renewable energy subsidy costs but recommended no increase in nuclear loan guarantees. The final bill did not provide additional funding for subsidy costs or increase the existing loan guarantee ceilings.", "DOE also administers the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) Loan Program established by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 ( P.L. 110-140 ). The FY2009 Continuing Resolution appropriated $7.5 billion to allow DOE to issue up to $25 billion in direct loans. The program was designed to provide loans to eligible automobile manufacturers and parts suppliers for making investments in their plant capacity to produce vehicles with improved fuel economy. Along with the EPACT loan guarantee programs, the ATVM Loan Program is administered by the DOE Loan Programs Office. DOE reports that five ATVM loans have been issued, totaling $8.4 billion, plus a conditional commitment of $730 million.

These programs aim to extend the life of existing warheads through design, certification, manufacture, and replacement of components. An LEP for the B61 mods 7 and 11 bombs was completed in FY2009. An LEP for the W76 warhead for the Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile is ongoing; its FY2010 actual appropriation was $231.9 million and the FY2011 enacted figure was $248.2 million. The FY2012 request was $257.0 million for the W76 LEP and $223.6 million for the B61 LEP. The latter represents a shift \"from a feasibility study to a full LEP\"; no funds were requested in FY2010 or FY2011 for the B61 LEP. This LEP is intended to extend the service life of B61 mods 3, 4, and 7 nuclear bombs for another 30 years, with the first production unit to be completed in FY2017. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $278.6 million for the B61 for FY2012 in order to begin the LEP. It allowed NNSA to spend up to half that amount until it meets certain reporting requirements, such as \"a cost-benefit analysis of any warhead enhancements.\" For the W76 LEP, the committee recommended $255.0 million.

It specified that at least $175.0 million be used for surveillance of the stockpile, and recommended reducing funds for the W78 LEP from $51.1 million to $26.0 million because of delays in a study for this LEP. The final appropriation provided $487.6 million for Stockpile Systems. Of these funds, it directed NNSA to use $175.0 million for surveillance and $99.5 million for W78 Stockpile Systems. Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition (WDD). The President and Congress have agreed on the desirability of reducing the stockpile to the lowest level consistent with national security, and numbers of warheads have fallen sharply since the end of the Cold War. Because of the large number of warheads being retired, there is a need to dismantle some warheads and to further break down some components to \"prevent storage problems across the [nuclear weapons] enterprise.\" WDD involves interim storage of warheads to be dismantled; dismantlement; and disposition (i.e., storing or eliminating warhead components and materials). The FY2010 actual appropriation was $95.8 million and the FY2011 enacted figure was $57.9 million. The FY2012 request was $56.8 million; the House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended providing that amount, and the appropriation provided that amount.", "Several components of WDD have been moved to different organizations within DOE or to different budget categories within Weapons Activities in the last several years. Within WDD, the major activity for FY2009 was the Pit Disassembly and Conversion Facility (PDCF), which was moved to the Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities account for FY2010. The \"pit\" is the fissile component (usually plutonium) of a nuclear warhead that initiates a thermonuclear explosion. As warheads are dismantled, pits may be stored, but for permanent disposition PDCF would convert the plutonium in pits to plutonium oxide for use in a Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF), where it would become fuel for commercial light-water nuclear reactors. In FY2008, MFFF was transferred from NNSA to DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy. WDD includes a Waste Solidification Building (WSB) to convert liquid wastes from PDCF and MFFF into solids for disposal off-site.

This program \"integrates scientific and technological advances from stockpile stewardship with input from continuing studies in order to: improve the weapons certification process; refine computational tools and methods; advance the physical understanding of surety mechanisms; understand failure modes; assess new manufacturing processes; and anticipate technological surprise.\" The proposed FY2012 program would include experiments to address weapon failure modes, examining options to modernize surety (sometimes defined as safety, security, and use control), and study of factors that affect the ability to certify a warhead's surety and performance. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $312.1 million for the Science Campaign. The largest reduction was $75.5 million to Advanced Certification, for a total of $19.4 million. The committee stated that this subprogram had originally focused on addressing concerns about the ability to certify the Reliable Replacement Warhead. However, the latter program has been canceled and the Administration does not intend to produce a new warhead, so \"it is unclear why such large increases are being requested.\" The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $347.1 million for this campaign. It specified that no funds would be used for scaled experiments, \"a type of subcritical experiment that uses plutonium pit-like designs,\" on grounds that such experiments would cost hundreds of millions of dollars and \"may not be needed for annual assessments of the current stockpile.\" The committee recommended $40.0 million for Advanced Certification. The final appropriation provided $334.0 million for the Science Campaign, including $40.0 million for Advanced Certification. Engineering Campaign. This campaign \"provides the modern tools and capabilities needed to ensure the safety, security, reliability and performance of the United States nuclear weapons stockpile \u2026 [It] funds activities that assess and improve fielded nuclear and non-nuclear engineering components without further underground testing.\" The FY2010 actual appropriation was $149.7 million and the FY2011 enacted figure was $140.9 million.

This campaign is developing the tools to create extremely high temperatures and pressures in the laboratory\u2014approaching those of a nuclear explosion\u2014to support weapons-related research and to attract scientific talent to the Stockpile Stewardship Program. NNSA states, \"Virtually all of the energy from a nuclear weapon is generated while in the high energy density (HED) state. High-energy density physics (HEDP) experiments conducted at ICF facilities are required to validate the advanced theoretical models used to assess and certify the stockpile without nuclear testing. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) extends HEDP experiments to include access to thermonuclear burn conditions in the laboratory, a unique and unprecedented scientific achievement.\" The centerpiece of this campaign is NIF, the world's largest laser. While NIF was controversial in Congress for many years and had significant cost growth and technical problems, controversy waned as the program progressed. The facility was dedicated in May 2009. Between February 20, 2011, and March 20, 2011, NIF personnel conducted 34 \"successful target shots \u2026 in support of HEDSS [High Energy Density Stockpile Stewardship].\" In 2011, personnel conducted a total of 283 NIF shots of all types.

The House Appropriations Committee recommended providing $471.2 million, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended providing the requested amount. The committee noted that NIF made an important contribution to \"resolving a critical stockpile stewardship issue\" but expressed concern about whether NIF could achieve ignition by the end of FY2012. The appropriation provided the requested amount. Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC) Campaign. This campaign develops computation-based models of nuclear weapons that integrate data from other campaigns, past test data, laboratory experiments, and elsewhere to create what NNSA calls \"the computational surrogate for nuclear testing to determine weapon behavior.\" In addition, \"ASC plays an important role in supporting nonproliferation, emergency response, nuclear forensics and attribution activities.\" Some analysts doubt that simulation can be relied upon to provide the confidence needed to certify the safety, security, and reliability of warheads, and advocate a return to testing. The campaign includes funds for hardware and operations as well as for software. The FY2010 actual appropriation was $566.1 million; the FY2011 enacted figure was $611.0 million. For FY2012, the request was $628.9 million and the House Appropriations Committee recommended $616.0 million. The reduction concerned a new initiative, \"exascale\" computing, a thousand-fold increase above current capability. The committee stated that \"undertaking such a major initiative will require considerable funding, and the NNSA has yet to tie the need for this level of computing to any specific requirements of the stockpile in its 20-year plan.\" The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $625.0 million, noted the importance of exascale computing for stockpile stewardship, and recommended the requested amount, $36.0 million, for the exascale initiative within ASC Campaign funds.

However, deep spending cuts ... will likely result in delays that will require the laboratory to continue operations in the existing CMR facility.\"", "In its FY2009 report, the House Appropriations Committee stated, regarding CMRR and another facility at Los Alamos (the Radioactive Liquid Waste Treatment Facility), \"In the absence of critical decisions on the nature and size of the stockpile, which in turn generate requirements for the nature and capacity of the nuclear weapons complex, it is impossible to determine the capacity required of either of these facilities. It would be imprudent to design and construct on the basis of a guess at their required capacity.\" It recommended no funds for either project. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $125.0 million, an increase of $24.8 million, for CMRR \"to make up for [previous] funding shortfalls.\"", "Several documents supported CMRR. In 2009, a congressional commission found conditions at the existing CMR to be \"genuinely decrepit\" and recommended proceeding with CMRR to replace it. The 2010 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) recommended proceeding with CMRR as one of several \"key investments \u2026 required to sustain a safe, secure, and effective nuclear arsenal.\" An Administration report to Congress of November 2010 said that CMRR and another facility, the Uranium Processing Facility, \"are required to ensure the United States can maintain a safe, secure and effective arsenal over the long-term. The NPR concluded that the United States needed to build these facilities; the Administration remains committed to their construction.\" And the resolution of ratification for the New START Treaty required the President to certify to the Senate that the President intends to \"accelerate to the extent possible the design and engineering phase of\" CMRR and to request full funding for it when the design and engineering phase is complete. On the other hand, critics argue that CMRR is not needed for its stated purposes, is very expensive, is \"managerially risky,\" and lacks clarity regarding purpose, need, design concept, cost, safety performance standards, etc.", "For FY2012, the House Appropriations Committee recommended $200.0 million, a $100.0 million reduction from the request. The committee stated that it is \"seriously concerned with the recent cost growth reported for construction\" of CMRR and another facility, the Uranium Processing Facility (UPF), planned for Y-12 National Security Complex. Further, \"Modernization will take several years and the considerable number of variables still at play argues against an excessively aggressive funding curve. The construction of the new major facilities must not force out available modernization funding for the rest of the nuclear security enterprise. Therefore, the Committee supports the adoption of cost reduction strategies to make construction more affordable and to curb continued cost escalation.\" The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $240.0 million for CMRR. It noted that new cost estimates for CMRR and UPF \"are two to three times more than previous estimates\" and directed NNSA to submit a plan by February 1, 2012, identifying \"consequences to cost, scope, and schedule of delaying project implementation and the impact of sequencing construction of these two major facilities [i.e., as opposed to building them concurrently] on stockpile requirements.\" The conference report stated, \"No construction activities are funded for the CMRR-Nuclear Facility during fiscal year 2012.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Programs", "paragraphs": ["Weapons Activities includes several smaller programs in addition to DSW, Campaigns, and RTBF.

Many employees chose the former. The House Appropriations Committee noted that \"the pensions of legacy national laboratory employees are an ongoing stewardship cost of the nuclear weapons complex\"; that funding for these pensions was requested through RTBF and a program within Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, another component of NNSA; and that its recommendation \"provides funding for these multiple requests in a single funding line as a simplified and more transparent solution to managing these costs.\" This is a new line item in the budget, for which the House Appropriations Committee recommended $147.0 million for FY2012.

In 1989, DOE established what is now the Office of Environmental Management to consolidate the cleanup of former nuclear weapons production facilities that had been administered under multiple offices. These cleanup efforts are broad in scope and include the disposal of large quantities of radioactive and other hazardous wastes generated over decades; management and disposal of surplus nuclear materials; remediation of extensive contamination in soil and groundwater; decontamination and decommissioning of excess buildings and facilities; and safeguarding, securing, and maintaining facilities while cleanup is underway. Some facilities also were involved in civilian nuclear energy research, which generated wastes and contamination. The Office of Environmental Management administers the cleanup of these research facilities, adding a non-defense component to its mission, albeit smaller in terms of scope and funding. ", "Efforts to clean up the environmental legacy of nuclear weapons production and nuclear energy research represent the single largest environmental liability of the United States, exceeding the cleanup liability of Department of Defense facilities. The need for annual appropriations of several billion dollars to clean up nuclear weapons production and nuclear energy research facilities has generated ongoing interest within Congress about the long-term financial liability of the United States to address potential risks at these sites. How to ensure the protection of public safety, human health, and the environment in the most expedient and cost-effective manner has been a perennial issue in the appropriations debate.", "DOE has identified in excess of 100 facilities in over 30 states that historically were involved in the production of nuclear weapons and nuclear energy research, covering approximately 2 million acres of land combined. Cleanup remedies are in place at the majority of these facilities, and they have been transferred to the Office of Legacy Management and other offices within DOE for long-term stewardship to maintain and monitor them. See the \"Office of Legacy Management\" section of this report. Some of the smaller facilities also have been transferred to the Army Corps of Engineers under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP), and are now funded within the civil works budget of the Corps. (See Table 4 .) Once the Corps completes the cleanup of these sites, they are transferred back to DOE for long-term stewardship under the Office of Legacy Management. Much work remains to be done at the larger and more complex facilities that are still administered by the Office of Environmental Management. DOE expects cleanup to continue for several years or even decades at some of these facilities, necessitating billions of dollars.

DOE estimated that the costs to complete these actions could range between $185 billion and $218 billion, exceeding past costs already incurred. DOE periodically revises these estimates as project baselines and assumptions change. The estimates have varied widely over time by many billions of dollars. DOE typically estimates a range of costs, rather than a single dollar amount, to reflect uncertainties in the cleanup process. For example, final decisions have yet to be made at some facilities to determine the actions that will be necessary to remediate contamination. Methods to dispose of vast quantities of wastes, and the scheduling of these actions, also could affect cleanup costs and time frames.

Title XI of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 ( P.L. 102-486 ) established the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund to pay for the cleanup of these facilities, and to reimburse uranium and thorium licensees for their costs of cleaning up sites that supported the enrichment facilities. To finance this fund, Congress originally authorized the collection of special assessments from nuclear utilities based on the portion of enrichment services each utility purchased from the federal government. Congress also authorized payments by the federal government to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund out of the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury, subject to annual appropriations.", "The original requirement for both the federal government, and the nuclear utilities that purchased enrichment services, to contribute to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund was based on the premise that both the United States and the nuclear utilities benefitted from the production of enriched uranium and therefore should share in the liability for cleanup of facilities involved in these activities. The authority to collect the utility assessments, and the authorization of appropriations for the federal payment, expired on October 24, 2007.

The Office of Legacy Management also manages the payment of pensions and post-retirement benefits of former contractor personnel who worked at DOE facilities that do not have a continuing mission, among other supporting activities. The Office of Legacy Management is funded within DOE's Other Defense Activities Account. The President requested $170.1 million within this account for the Office of Legacy Management in FY2012, somewhat less than the FY2011 enacted appropriation of $171.6 million. As passed by the House, H.R. 2354 would have provided $167.1 million for FY2012, and the Senate Appropriations Committee has recommended $169.7 million in reporting its version of the bill.

Over the next 10 years, DOE projects that the number of facilities administered by the Office of Legacy Management will rise from 91 in FY2011 to 129 in FY2020. Estimating the funding needs is challenging because of the lengthy time horizons that are involved. For example, actions may be necessary for many decades to operate and maintain cleanup remedies and monitor contaminant levels to ensure the effectiveness of the remedies over time. At sites where the cleanup entails the permanent containment of radioactive wastes, long-term stewardship may continue indefinitely because of the time required for radioactivity to decay to acceptable levels. Enforcement of land use restrictions or other institutional controls may be necessary in perpetuity at facilities that are not cleaned up for unrestricted use, in order to prevent potentially harmful exposure. These and other factors make it difficult to reliably estimate the financial liability for long-term stewardship."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Power Marketing Administrations", "paragraphs": ["DOE's four Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs)\u2014Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA), Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA), and Western Area Power Administration (WAPA)\u2014were established to sell the power generated by the dams operated by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers.

This is an overall decrease of $10 million (4%) compared with the FY2011 appropriation. The FY2012 budget request continues a change enacted in FY2010 that reclassified receipts from the PMAs from mandatory to discretionary. This change offsets many of the expenses of WAPA, SWPA, and SEPA that were previously paid for with discretionary appropriations. As a result of the change, two PMAs require discretionary funding in addition to their receipts: SWPA requests $11.8 million and WAPA requests $95.9 million. Receipts for SEPA are expected to offset all operating costs in FY2011. In addition, $220,000 is requested for Falcon and Amistad operations and maintenance, and collections of $23 million from Colorado River basins score as an additional offset toward the net discretionary appropriation. In FY2012 appropriations markups, the House and Senate agreed to these amounts, and the final bill, P.L. 112-74 , appropriated them.", "BPA is a self-funded agency under authority granted by P.L. 93-454 (16 U.S.C. \u00a7838), the Federal Columbia River Transmission System Act of 1974, and receives no appropriations. However, it funds some of its activities from permanent borrowing authority, which was increased in FY2003 from $3.75 billion to $4.45 billion (a $700 million increase). ARRA further increased the amount of borrowing that BPA conducts under the Transmission System Act by $3.25 billion to the current authority for $7.7 billion in bonds outstanding to the Treasury.

The authority to borrow from the United States Treasury had not previously been available to WAPA. It is now available on a permanent, indefinite basis, with the amount of borrowing outstanding not to exceed $3.25 billion.
