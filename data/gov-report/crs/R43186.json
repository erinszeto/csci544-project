The conflict of interest theory under which the \"blind trust\" provisions operate is that since the government officer will eventually not know the identity of the specific assets in the trust (there cannot be any restrictions on the sale or disposition of assets in a \"qualified\" blind trust and the trustee must be independent of the official), those financial interests could not act as influences on the officer or employee's official decisions, thus avoiding real or apparent conflicts of interests.

Concerns over potential identity theft, the increased opportunities for malicious data mining, and public safety concerns for many federal employees in law enforcement or for those employed overseas, as well as constitutional concerns over financial privacy, led to a study and re-examination of the issue of Internet publication of the detailed financial reports by lower-level federal officials. In a study by the independent National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA), that organization concluded that \"the online posting requirement does little to help detect conflicts of interest and insider trading, but that it can harm federal missions and individual employees. \" Congress responded by amending the STOCK Act to require the Internet posting of the disclosure reports filed by the highest-level officials in the government, but leaving in place the existing public availability of the disclosure reports for all other employees in the executive and legislative branches.
