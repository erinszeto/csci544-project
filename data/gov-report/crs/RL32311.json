Foreign Operations also includes resources for the two newest Administration initiatives: the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and the Global AIDS Initiative managed by the State Department's HIV/AIDS Coordinator. Most humanitarian aid activities are funded within Foreign Operations, including USAID's disaster/famine program and the State Department's refugee relief support. Foreign Operations includes separate accounts for aid programs in the former Soviet Union (also referred to as the Independent States account) and Central/Eastern Europe, activities that are jointly managed by USAID and the State Department.", "Security assistance (economic and military aid) for Israel and Egypt is also part of the Foreign Operations spending measure, as are other security aid programs administered largely by the State Department, in conjunction with USAID and the Pentagon. Most recently, Foreign Operations has funded reconstruction programs in both Afghanistan and Iraq. U.S. contributions to the World Bank and other regional multilateral development banks, managed by the Treasury Department, and voluntary payments to international organizations, handled by the State Department, are also funded in the Foreign Operations bill. Finally, the legislation includes appropriations for three export promotion agencies: the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), the Export-Import Bank, and the Trade and Development Agency.", "For two decades, the Foreign Operations appropriations bill has been the principal legislative vehicle for congressional oversight of foreign affairs and for congressional involvement in foreign policy making. Congress has not enacted a comprehensive foreign aid authorization bill since 1985, leaving most foreign assistance programs without regular authorizations originating from the legislative oversight committees. As a result, Foreign Operations spending measures developed by the appropriations committees increasingly have expanded their scope beyond spending issues and played a major role in shaping, authorizing, and guiding both executive and congressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives. It has been largely through Foreign Operations appropriations that the United States has modified aid policy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the Cold War. The legislation has also been the channel through which the President has utilized foreign aid as a tool in the global war on terrorism since the attacks of September 11, 2001, and launched Afghan and Iraqi reconstruction operations.", "The appropriations measure has also been a key instrument used by Congress to apply restrictions and conditions on Administration management of foreign assistance, actions that have frequently resulted in executive-legislative clashes over presidential prerogatives in foreign policy making."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Status", "paragraphs": ["President Bush submitted his FY2005 federal budget request to Congress on February 2, 2004, including funding proposals for Foreign Operations Appropriations programs.

U.S. aid programs were designed to promote economic development and policy reforms, in large part to create stability and reduce the attraction to communist ideology and to block Soviet diplomatic links and military advances. Other security assistance activities provided defense equipment and training to American allies and friendly states, some of which faced Soviet or Soviet-proxy threats. Aid programs also were used to help the U.S. gain access to military bases around the world in order to forward deploy American forces.", "Foreign aid programs also supported a number of secondary U.S. policy goals, such as reducing high rates of population growth, promoting wider access to health care, expanding the availability of basic education in the developing world, advancing U.S. trade interests, and protecting the environment. If these secondary goals were also achieved, U.S. aid programs could be promoted as delivering \"more bang for the buck.\"", "With the end of the Cold War, the United States launched expansive aid programs in Russia and many eastern-bloc states that were previously those that U.S. assistance tried to combat. While these and other new elements of American foreign aid emerged, no broad consensus developed over what should be the new overarching rationale for U.S. aid programs. Throughout the 1990s, policymakers and Congress explored a number of alternative strategic frameworks around which to construct a revised foreign assistance policy rationale. Not only did a policy consensus fail to emerge, but efforts to overhaul the largely Cold War-based foreign aid legislation also did not succeed.", "During this period, the Clinton Administration emphasized the promotion of \"sustainable development\" as the new, post-Cold War main strategy of those parts of the foreign aid program under the aegis of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Economic assistance supported six inter-related goals: achievement of broad-based, economic growth; development of democratic systems; stabilization of world population and protection of human health; sustainable management of the environment; building human capacity through education and training; and meeting humanitarian needs.", "Early in the Bush Administration these goals were modified around three \"strategic pillars\" of 1) economic growth, agriculture, and trade; 2) global health; and 3) democracy, conflict prevention, and humanitarian assistance. More recently, a USAID White Paper on American foreign aid identified five \"core\" operational goals of U.S. foreign assistance:", "Promoting transformational development, especially in the areas of governance, institutional capacity, and economic restructuring; Strengthening fragile states; Providing humanitarian assistance; Supporting U.S. geostrategic interests, particularly in countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Jordan, Egypt, and Israel; and Mitigating global and international ills, including HIV/AIDS.", "Perhaps the most defining change in U.S. foreign aid policy came following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States when American foreign assistance has taken on a more strategic sense of importance and has been cast frequently in terms of contributing to the global war on terrorism. In September 2002, President Bush released his Administration's National Security Strategy that established global development, for the first time, as the third \"pillar\" of U.S. national security, along with defense and diplomacy. Also in 2002, executive branch foreign assistance budget justifications began to underscore the war on terrorism as the top foreign aid priority, highlighting amounts of U.S. assistance to about 30 \"front-line\" states in the terrorism war\u2014countries that cooperated with the United States in the war on terrorism or faced terrorist threats themselves. The substantial reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq\u2014which total more in FY2004 than the combined budgets of all other aid programs\u2014are also part of the emphasis on using foreign aid to combat terrorism.", "At roughly the same time that fighting terrorism became the leading concern of American foreign aid, the Bush Administration announced other significant initiatives that have defined and strengthened two additional key foreign assistance goals: promoting economic growth and reducing poverty, and combating the global HIV/AIDS pandemic. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is a new aid delivery concept, authorized by Congress and established in early 2004, that is intended to concentrate significantly higher amounts of U.S. resources in a few low- and low-middle income countries that have demonstrated a strong commitment to political, economic, and social reforms. If fully funded, $5 billion will be available by FY2006 to support these \"best development performers\" in order to accelerate economic growth and lower the number of people living in absolute poverty.", "Addressing global health problems has further become a core U.S. aid objective in recent years. Congress created a separate appropriation account for Child Survival and Health activities in the mid-1990s and increased funding for international HIV/AIDS and other infectious disease programs. President Bush's announcement at his 2003 State of the Union message of a five-year, $15 billion effort to combat AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis has added greater emphasis to this primary foreign assistance objective.", "Beyond these recently emerging foreign aid goals, other prominent objectives that have continued since the early 1990s have included supporting peace in the Middle East through assistance to Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and the Palestinians; fostering democratization and stability for countries in crisis, such as Bosnia, Haiti, Rwanda, Kosovo, and Liberia; facilitating democratization and free market economies in Central Europe and the former Soviet Union; suppressing international narcotics production and trafficking through assistance to Colombia and other Andean drug-producing countries; and alleviating famine and mitigating refugee situations in places throughout the world."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Foreign Operations Funding Trends", "paragraphs": ["As shown in the Figure 1, Foreign Operations funding levels, expressed in real terms taking into account the effects of inflation, have fluctuated widely over the past 29 years. After peaking at over $34 billion in FY1985 (constant FY2005 dollars), Foreign Operations appropriations began a period of decline to a low-point of $14.1 billion in FY1997, with only a brief period of higher amounts in the early 1990s due to special supplementals for Panama and Nicaragua (1990), countries affected by the Gulf War (1991), and the former Soviet states (1993).", "Arguing that declining international affairs resources seriously undermined U.S. foreign policy interests and limited the ability of American officials to influence overseas events, Clinton Administration officials and other outside groups vigorously campaigned to reverse the decade-long decline in the foreign policy budget. Foreign aid spending increased slightly in FY1998, but beginning the following year and continuing to the present, Foreign Operations appropriations have trended upward due in large part to the approval of resources for special, and in some cases unanticipated foreign policy contingencies and new initiatives.", "While funding for regular, continuing foreign aid programs also rose modestly during this period, supplemental spending for special activities, such as Central American hurricane relief (FY1999), Kosovo emergency assistance (FY1999), Wye River/Middle East peace accord support (FY2000), a counternarcotics initiative in Colombia and the Andean region (FY2000 and FY2002-FY2004), aid to the front line states in the war on terrorism and Iraq-war related assistance (FY2003-FY2004), was chiefly responsible for the growth in foreign aid appropriations.", "While Foreign Operations appropriations had been rising for five consecutive years, amounts approved in FY2003 and FY2004 reached unprecedented levels over the past 40 years. Regular appropriations approved in these two years were roughly on par with amounts of the previous few years. But substantial supplementals of $7.5 billion and $21.2 billion, respectively, for assistance to the front line states in the war on terrorism and Afghanistan and Iraq reconstruction, have pushed spending upward. The regular Foreign Operations bill, signed by the President on January 23, 2004, combined with an earlier Iraq supplemental approved in November 2003 ( P.L. 108-106 ) and subsequent emergency relief for Darfur, Sudan ( P.L. 108-287 ), brought FY2004 appropriations to $39.4 billion (constant FY2005 dollars), the highest level, in real terms, since the early 1960s.", "The enacted level for FY2005 of $19.74 billion, while less than the previous two years, is the largest Foreign Operations appropriation, in real terms, than all other years in over a decade. Moreover, the FY2005 total is likely to grow when Congress considers supplemental funding for tsunami disaster relief and possibly additional Iraq reconstruction needs.", "Supplemental resources for Foreign Operations programs, which in FY2004 exceeded regular Foreign Operations funding, have become a significant channel of funding for U.S. international activities. Due to the nature of rapidly changing overseas events and the emergence of unanticipated contingencies to which it is in the U.S. national interest to respond, it is not surprising that foreign aid and defense resources from time to time are the major reason for considering and approving supplemental spending outside the regular appropriation cycle. Supplementals have provided resources for such major foreign policy events as the Camp David accords (FY1979), Central America conflicts (FY1983), Africa famine and a Middle East economic downturn (FY1985), Panama and Nicaragua government transitions (FY1990), the Gulf War (FY1991), and Bosnia relief and reconstruction (FY1996).", "But after a period of only one significant foreign aid supplemental in eight years, beginning in FY1999 Congress has approved Foreign Operations supplemental appropriations exceeding $1 billion in each of the past six years. Relief for Central American victims of Hurricane Mitch, Kosovo refugees, and victims of the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania in FY1999 totaled $1.6 billion, and was followed in FY2000 by a $1.1 billion supplemental, largely to fund the President's new counternarcotics initiative in Colombia. As part of a $40 billion emergency supplemental to fight terrorism enacted in September 2001, President Bush and Congress allocated $1.4 billion for foreign aid activities in FY2001 and FY2002. Another $1.15 billion supplemental cleared Congress in FY2002 to augment Afghan reconstruction efforts and assist other \"front-line\" states in the war on terrorism.", "Until FY2003, these additional resources accounted for between 7% and 11% of total Foreign Operations spending. The $7.5 billion Iraq War supplemental for FY2003, however, went well beyond these standards, representing nearly one-third of the FY2003 Foreign Operations budget, and was surpassed, as noted above, only by FY2004 supplemental appropriations, which more than doubled the Foreign Operations budget for the year."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Foreign Operations, the FY2005 Budget Resolution, and Sec. 302(b) Allocations", "paragraphs": ["Usually, Appropriations Committees begin markups of their spending bills only after Congress has adopted a budget resolution and funds have been distributed to the Appropriations panels under what is referred to as the Section 302(a) allocation process, a reference to the pertinent authority in the Congressional Budget Act. Following this, House and Senate Appropriations Committees separately decide how to allot the total amount available among their 13 subcommittees, staying within the functional guidelines set in the budget resolution. This second step is referred to as the Section 302(b) allocation. Foreign Operations funds fall within the International Affairs budget function (Function 150), representing in most years about 65% of the function total. Smaller amounts of Function 150 are included in four other appropriation bills.", "How much International Affairs money to allocate to each of the four subcommittees with jurisdiction over the International Affairs programs, and how to distribute the funds among the numerous programs are decisions exclusively reserved for the Appropriations Committees. Nevertheless, overall ceilings set in the budget resolution can have significant implications for the budget limitations within which the House and Senate Foreign Operations subcommittees will operate when they meet to mark up their annual appropriation bills.", "On May 19, 2004, House and Senate conferees agreed to a budget framework for FY2005 ( S.Con.Res. 95 ) that included $821 billion in discretionary budget authority. The discretionary budget authority target for the International Affairs function, out of which Foreign Operations programs receive their funding, was $29.28 billion, $2.2 billion or 7% less than the President's request. If the conference recommendations were followed during the appropriation process, it was likely that the Administration's proposal for Foreign Operations could not be fully met.", "The House and Senate Appropriations Committees, however, can choose to allocate the $29.28 billion among the four subcommittees proportionally different than what the President proposed or to alter the overall amount for foreign policy activities. Depending on other competing priorities, the final allocations can diverge significantly from those assumed in the budget resolution.", "Complicating decisions related to the 302(b) allocation process was the lack of a final vote on the FY2005 budget resolution's conference agreement. The House passed the measure on May 19 (216-213) and \"deemed\" the $821 billion discretionary budget authority cap included in the budget resolution as guidance for the Appropriations Committee. The resolution, however, remained pending in the Senate where disagreements focused on the size of the deficit, budget enforcement mechanisms, and extending existing tax cuts, matters unrelated to international affairs funding issues. While Congress can, and did proceed with consideration of appropriation bills without finalizing the budget resolution, the lack of broad consensus on overall spending levels can make it more difficult to pass each of the 13 appropriation measures.", "On June 2, the House Appropriations Committee released its 302(b) allocations, providing $19.39 billion for Foreign Operations. The amount is $1.93 billion, or 9.1% less than the President's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee announced its subcommittee allocations on September 8, making available the identical amount for Foreign Operations as approved by the House panel. The reduction for Foreign Operations in both houses was the largest for any of the 13 subcommittees when compared to the Administration's recommendation.", "As approved in H.R. 4818 , the omnibus Consolidated Appropriation Act, 2005, the final total amount for Foreign Operations exceeds the level previously allocated for the bill. This is largely the result of a White House-congressional agreement to add funds for the Millennium Challenge Account and to include $93 million in \"emergency\" funding\u2014an amount that does not count against the allocation cap\u2014for relief and peacekeeping activities in the Darfur region of Sudan.

Performance trends, missing or old data, and recent policy actions might come into play during selection deliberations, officials noted.", "The final selection reflected decisions that both strictly followed the performance indicator outcomes and applied Board discretion to take into account other factors. Ten of the countries complied with the stated criteria: performing above the median in relation to their peers on at least half of the indicators in each of the three policy clusters and performing above the median on corruption. The Board also examined whether a country performed substantially below average on any single indicator and whether their selection was supported by supplemental information. Each of the ten countries also passed these additional tests.", "For ten other countries, however, some discretion was applied by the Board. In three cases\u2014Cape Verde, Lesotho, and Sri Lanka\u2014the countries met the criteria but fell significantly below average on one indicator, yet were still selected by the Board due to recent policy changes or positive trend lines. For three others\u2014Bolivia, Georgia, and Mozambique\u2014the Board deviated from a strict application of the selection criteria because of evidence that the governments were taking corrective actions in the deficient areas.", "On the other hand, the MCC Board chose not to select four countries that technically met the performance criteria but fell substantially below the median on one or more indicator. In each of these cases, the Board did not believe that the government was taking any action to improve its performance. Although Bhutan, Mauritania, and Vietnam passed the corruption hurdle and half of the \"ruling justly\" indicators, they scored very low on the measurements for Political Rights and Civil Liberties, and in Vietnam's case, on the Voice and Accountability indicator. A fourth country\u2014Guyana\u2014was also not selected despite passing the necessary hurdles. It scored particularly low on the Fiscal Policy measurement.", "It has been long assumed by MCC officials and close observers of the MCA initiative that when the country selections were announced, there would be disagreements and possible surprises in the final list, especially if the Board exercised its discretionary authority as it did for FY2004 participants. Representative Lowey, for example, expressed her view at a May 13 House Appropriations Committee hearing that East Timor, which failed to pass the \"economic freedom\" hurdle in part due to missing data on two of the indicators, should have been selected. CEO Applegarth responded that East Timor is a new nation and that it was premature to conclude that it was a \"high-performing\" country. He acknowledged, however, that East Timor should be given close consideration in the future if the current trend lines continue.", "Besides East Timor, some suggested that Kenya should have been included because of its new government's commitment to education and anti-corruption efforts. USAID Administrator Natsios acknowledged at the hearing that Albania was a \"close call,\" failing because it scored slightly below the median on corruption. Like Albania, Malawi and Moldova would have qualified on the basis of performance if not for slightly failing scores on corruption. Several small island states, including Kiribati, Sao Tome, and Tonga, were not selected even though the absence of data for several categories may have played a role.", "Despite these questions over specific country eligibility, the selection process appeared to have satisfied two major concerns that have been consistently expressed over the past year. Based on earlier analysis, some argued that Africa would be under-represented in the final selection process, with perhaps as few as three regional states participating. In fact, eight, or half of the first year qualifying nations, were from Africa. Selection of countries that would give the appearance of geostrategic considerations was a concern of many who view the absence of security-related factors from MCA decision-making as one of the most attractive features of the initiative. Had the Board used its discretionary powers to select Indonesia, for example, some critics would have likely charged that the decision stemmed more from Jakarta's role in the war on terrorism than on strict policy performance. Indonesia passed all necessary hurdles except for corruption."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Country Selection for FY2005", "paragraphs": ["Meeting on November 8, the MCC Board of Directors made its selection of FY2005 eligible countries:", "The Board chose one new country for FY2005\u2014Morocco\u2014while 15 of the 16 nations included for FY2004 were determined eligible again for FY2005. Cape Verde was not selected due to the fact that its per capita GNI exceeded the $1,465 ceiling. Cape Verde, however, remains eligible for MCA support using FY2004 funds. Board selections represent both a high degree of continuity between FY2004 decisions as well as a sharp difference in the degree to which it applied its discretionary authority for qualifying or denying countries for FY2005.", "The fact that each country (except Cape Verde) selected for FY2004 MCA participation was also declared eligible for FY2005 should not be surprising, given the nature of the MCA concept. The Board identified in May 2004 what it determined to be the 16 \"best performers\" based on the assumption that these countries had, and would continue to express, a strong commitment to the types of economic, governance, and social policy reforms measured by the MCC. Absent a substantial negative development since May, there was a presumed expectation that these same countries would score well in a subsequent performance comparison with their income peers. Moreover, except in some extreme situations, evidence of a slide in policy performance as measured through the various data sources would likely lag behind the actual policy shift and not be reflected in the immediate data updates.", "In addition, two other factors that may not apply in future years seem to have affected the outcome for FY2005. First, with the selection dates for FY2004 and FY2005 coming only six months apart\u2014rather than one year, as should be the case in the future\u2014it was likely that the data would indicate less change than might be the case if the comparisons occurred over a longer period. Between May and November, several of the data sources upon which the 16 performance indicators are based did not update or revise their figures. As a result, the review of countries for FY2005 was based on much of the same data and rankings as had been the case for the FY2004 selection.", "Moreover, the addition of 13 new countries for consideration in the FY2005 round had the effect for at least six of the indicators of lowering the median against which countries were compared. Because of this, if a country scored well\u2014above the median\u2014in the FY2004 selection decision, it was likely that it would score the same or better in the review for FY2005 where medians declined. For example, in May Bolivia fell exactly at the median on the corruption indicator. But in November, when the median for corruption dropped somewhat after new countries were added, Bolivia scored above the median even though Bolivia's score on corruption did not change. This phenomena is unlikely to be repeated again to the same extent since countries in the low-income group will be added or subtracted only if their economy grows beyond the per capita income ceiling or U.S. foreign aid sanctions are applied or lifted since the last review. The net effect is that the core set of low-income countries competing for MCA selection is unlikely to change as much as it did in FY2005, thereby reducing the extent to which the median will be altered simply because of the addition of new countries.", "Despite the degree of continuity between FY2004 and FY2005 in the selection of eligible countries, the MCC Board departed somewhat from the previous round by not selecting a large number of countries that technically met the MCA performance criteria. Many observers may raise questions over the FY2005 selections regarding the countries that were not selected rather than those that were.", "As noted above, in May 2004, the Board chose not to select four countries\u2014Bhutan, Guyana, Mauritania, and Vietnam\u2014although each passed the minimum number of indicators. The Board decided to exclude these four because they scored \"substantially below\" the median on one or more measurements, although without defining precisely what represented a mark \"substantially below\" the median.", "For FY2005, the Board did not select 10 countries that met the criteria, including three of the four left out of the FY2004 round (Mauritania did not meet the minimum qualifications). In addition, for FY2005 Burkina Faso, China, Djibouti, Egypt, Nepal, the Philippines, and Swaziland met the minimum standards but were not selected. Thus far, the Corporation has offered little explanation as to why these countries were not chosen. It appears, however, that scoring \"substantially below\"\u2014perhaps in the lowest 25 th percentile\u2014has become a de-facto criteria for exclusion. For example, the Corporation's CEO Paul Applegarth commented that the Philippines, a country that passed 13 of the 16 indicators, did not qualify because Manilla scored \"substantially below\" the median on tests for health expenditures and fiscal policy, and that more recent trends indicated the fiscal policy situation was deteriorating further. Each of the other nine nations that met the minimum qualifications but were not selected also had one score in the 25 th percentile, although the Corporation has not commented on whether this was the reason for not choosing them.", "Another possible reason for limiting the number of qualifying countries in the FY2005 round might be due to anticipated funding reductions. The Administration had requested combined FY2004/FY2005 appropriations of $3.8 billion, but may have available 25%-30% less, depending on the outcome of congressional debate on the FY2005 budget. Corporation officials have said that reduced funding would lead to fewer countries assisted and/or smaller grants per country, a situation that would be complicated further by qualifying additional nations.", "Instead, the Board of Directors invited three of these 10 countries to participate in the Threshold Program, intended to help \"near-miss\" nations take steps to strengthen areas that would help them qualify for full MCA assistance in the future. Burkina Faso, Guyana, and the Philippines may now apply for Threshold Program assistance.", "Another Board departure in the FY2005 selection process was to avoid using its discretionary authority to qualify countries that did not meet the minimum performance indicators. In May, the Board chose three nations\u2014Bolivia, Georgia, and Mozambique\u2014that did not pass the so-called \"hard-hurdle\" of corruption. The latter two again qualified despite falling below the median on corruption, while Bolivia did not require an exemption after the median dropped below its score with the addition of new countries. For FY2005, five nations\u2014Malawi, Moldova, Paraguay, Tanzania, and Ukraine\u2014passed the required number of performance indicators, except corruption.

The MCC set aside up to $40 million for countries that just missed qualifying for FY2004 funding and will announce an amount for FY2005 following enactment of new appropriations.", "The Corporation has made two announcements regarding the selection of Threshold Countries. On September 30, the Corporation named seven participants: Albania, East Timor, Kenya, Sao Tome and Principe, Tanzania, Uganda, and Yemen. Five weeks later, on November 8, the MCC added six more nations for FY2005: Burkina Faso, Guyana, Malawi, Paraguay, the Philippines, and Zambia. According to the Threshold Program Policy guidance issued by the Corporation, the program will assist countries make policy reforms and institutional changes in areas where they failed to meet the MCA performance criteria. If the Corporation, in consultation with USAID, determines that the concept paper shows sufficient commitment to reform and a promise of success, the country will prepare a Threshold Country Plan that specifically establishes a program schedule, the means to measure progress, and financing requirements, among other considerations. USAID is charged with overseeing the implementation of Threshold Country Plans, including working with countries to identify appropriate implementing partners such as local, U.S., and international firms; NGOs; U.S. government agencies; and international organizations.

Legislation authorizing the MCC requires the Corporation's CEO to coordinate with USAID and directs the Agency to ensure that its programs play a primary role in helping candidate countries prepare for MCA consideration. Corporation and USAID officials have said there will be close collaboration between the two entities, although the precise nature of the relationship has yet to be made public. USAID maintains missions in 14 of the 17 eligible countries might be expected to support MCC programs, through contracting, procurement, and monitoring tasks.", "Another question is how USAID will adjust its own programs in MCA countries, especially where the Agency maintains relatively small activities in relation to other donors. Since the goal is to provide resources that will make MCA programs among the largest aid operations in a country, it is likely that USAID spending will fall well below amounts provided through MCC Compacts. For example, in Mongolia, where U.S. aid programs have totaled $10-$12 million annually in recent years, the United States was the fourth largest bilateral donor in 2002, representing less than a quarter of the size of Japan's economic aid disbursements. In Ghana, Senegal, and Sri Lanka, USAID maintains larger programs but spends far less than other countries and multilateral agencies.", "Like other issues involving USAID, this question remains under review. USAID Administrator Natsios told the House Appropriations Committee on May 9, 2004, that the Agency would not withdraw from or cut programs in MCA countries, but would not increase spending either.

Representative Kolbe, chairman of the House Foreign Operations Subcommittee, speculated at a May 9 hearing that, based on recent Board decisions, by 2006 as many as 40 countries might have qualified. This, he believed, could not be fully supported with likely funding levels and might raise country expectations that could not be met, thereby undermining program incentives.", "MCC officials point out that qualification for the program does not mean that a government will receive funding. That decision will be based on the quality of the Compact proposals and it is possible that the Corporation will not finalize agreements with all eligible countries. A March 2004 GAO report estimated that the MCC could adequately fund 8-13 Compacts with an appropriation of $3.5 billion (the combined FY2004 enacted and FY2005 amounts). This suggests that, even if Congress fully funds the pending proposal, the Corporation will not be able to support programs in all 16 countries approved for FY2004 and those selected for FY2005. If Congress reduces the $2.5 billion request, the MCC may face increasing difficulties funding Compacts of a sufficient size that will have a meaningful impact on a country's economic growth and poverty reduction goals.

The Administration has also backed these programs, but officials object to congressional efforts to increase funding for children and health activities when it comes at the expense of other development sectors. More recently during the FY2003 and FY2004 budget cycles, some Members of Congress argued that it has been the executive branch that has added funds for Administration priorities by cutting resources for other development activities.", "In years when Congress has increased appropriations for its priorities, but not included a corresponding boost in the overall development aid budget, resources for other aid sectors, such as economic growth and the environment, have been substantially reduced. This was more problematic during the mid-to-late 1990s when world-wide development aid funding fell significantly. In more recent years, and especially for FY2003 and FY2004, Congress increased overall development assistance so that both congressional and executive program priorities could be funded without significant reductions for non-earmarked activities.

Under the initiative, USAID identifies good development opportunities being conducted by private foundations, non-governmental organizations, universities, and for-profit organizations, and provides parallel financing to leverage resources already committed to these activities. USAID officials envisioned that the agency would become much more of a coordinating and integrating institution to expand and enhance development efforts of these non-governmental development partners. Although it started out as a much more ambitious project\u2014USAID requested $160 million for FY2002\u2014the GDA has received relatively modest funding allocations, with a high of $20 million in FY2002, declining to $15 million in FY2004.

Congress has approved two Presidential foreign aid initiatives\u2014the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) and the President's Emergency Program for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)\u2014that are increasing funding significantly for development assistance programs. Moreover, the President's September 2002 National Security Strategy established global development, for the first time, as the third \"pillar\" of U.S. national security, along with defense and diplomacy.", "For FY2005, the President proposed another substantial increase in overall development assistance, although the programs were configured differently than they have been in the past and the additional resources were heavily concentrated in a few activities where about 30 countries would receive the greatest benefits. Although development activists, including numerous non-governmental organizations (NGOs), strongly support these rising foreign aid budgets, they have also raised questions about the degree of resource concentration and whether the Administration is committed to a broad-based, worldwide development strategy. While country participants in the two new foreign aid initiatives\u2014PEPFAR, which concentrates resources in 15 \"focus\" countries, and the MCA, for which 17 have been selected in FY2004 and FY2005\u2014are likely to see development aid from the United States grow significantly, the outlook for the other 30-40 recipients of American economic assistance is a projection of flat or slightly lower levels of aid.

Population Fund (UNFPA) if the organization maintains a program in China where allegations of coercive family planning have been widespread for many years, and whether abortion-related restrictions should be applied to bilateral USAID population aid grants (commonly known as the \"Mexico City\" policy)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "UNFPA Funding", "paragraphs": ["The most contentious issue usually concerns the abortion restriction question, but most recent attention has focused on UNFPA and a White House decision in July 2002 to block the $34 million U.S. contribution to the organization. During the Reagan and George H.W. Bush Administrations, the United States did not contribute to UNFPA because of concerns over practices of forced abortion and involuntary sterilization in China where UNFPA maintains programs. In 1985, Congress passed the so-called Kemp-Kasten amendment which has been made part of every Foreign Operations appropriation since, barring U.S. funds to any organization that supports or participates \"in the management\" of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. In 1993, President Clinton determined that UNFPA, despite its presence in China, was not involved in the management of a coercive program. From 1993 through the end of the decade, in most years Congress appropriated about $25 million for UNFPA, but added a directive that required that the amount be reduced by however much UNFPA spent in China. Consequently, the U.S. contribution has fluctuated between $21.5 million and $25 million.", "For FY2002, President George W. Bush requested $25 million for UNFPA. Congress provided in the FY2002 Foreign Operations bill \"not more than\" $34 million for UNFPA. While members of the Appropriations Committees said it was their intent to provide the full $34 million, the language allowed the President to allocate however much he chose, up to a $34 million ceiling. The White House placed a hold on UNFPA funds in January 2002 because new evidence suggested that coercive practices were continuing in Chinese counties where UNFPA concentrates its programs. A September 2001 investigation team, sponsored by the Population Research Institute, concluded that a consistent pattern of coercion continued in \"model\" UNFPA counties, including forced abortions and involuntary sterilizations. Refuting these findings, a UNFPA-commissioned review team found in October 2001 \"absolutely no evidence that the U.N. Population Fund supports coercive family planning practices in China or violates the human rights of Chinese people in any way.\" (See House International Relations Committee hearing, Coercive Population Control in China: New Evidence of Forced Abortion and Forced Sterilization , October 17, 2001.

Given the conflicting reports, the State Department sent its own investigative team to China for a two-week review of UNFPA programs on May 13, 2002. The team, which was led by former Ambassador William Brown and included Bonnie Glick, a former State Department official, and Dr. Theodore Tong, a public health professor at the University of Arizona, made three findings and recommendations in its report dated May 31, 2002.", "Findings:", "There is no evidence that UNFPA \"knowingly supported or participated in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization\" in China; China maintains coercive elements in its population programs; and Chinese leaders view \"population control as a high priority\" and remain concerned over implications of loosening controls for socioeconomic change.", "Recommendations:", "The United States should release not more than $34 million of previously appropriated funds to UNFPA; Until China ends all forms of coercion in law and practice, no U.S. government funds should be allocated to population programs in China; and Appropriate resources, possibly from the United States, should be allocated to monitor and evaluate Chinese population control programs.", "Despite the team's recommendation to release the $34 million, Secretary of State Powell decided on July 22, 2002, to withhold funds to UNFPA and to recommend that they be re-directed to other international family planning and reproductive health activities. The State Department's analysis of the Secretary's determination found that even though UNFPA did not \"knowingly\" support or participate in a coercive practice, that alone would not preclude the application of Kemp-Kasten. Instead, a finding that the recipient of U.S. funds\u2014in this case UNFPA\u2014simply supports or participates in such a program, whether knowingly or unknowingly, would trigger the restriction.", "The team found that the Chinese government imposes fines and penalties on families that have children exceeding the number approved by the government, a practice that in some cases coerces women to have abortions they would not otherwise undergo. The State Department analysis concluded that UNFPA's involvement in China's family planning program \"allows the Chinese government to implement more effectively its program of coercive abortion.\" (The full text of the State Department's analysis is online at the State Department's website, http://www.state.gov/g/prm/rls/other/12128.htm .

Presumably, this could have been made available to UNFPA if it was found not to be in violation of Kemp-Kasten. Following several legislative attempts to reverse the Administration's denial of UNFPA\u2014in both FY2002 supplemental appropriations and regular FY2003 Foreign Operations measures\u2014Congress approved in P.L. 108-7 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2003, a provision allocating $34 million to UNFPA, the same as in FY2002, so long as several conditions were met.

The State Department's justification of its September 25, 2003 letter to Congress regarding the FY2003 resources noted that the \"factual circumstances\" do not support making a determination that UNFPA no longer supports or participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. Section 572 of the FY2003 Foreign Operations Appropriations required the President to issue such a statement before restoring U.S. funding to UNFPA. These transferred funds, however, remained unspent due to \"holds\" placed on them by Members of Congress. The intent in placing the \"holds\" by some Members was to keep the money available for UNFPA in the event that circumstances changed and the Administration would make UNFPA eligible once again.", "In the FY2004 Foreign Operations enacted bill (Division D of P.L. 108-199 ), Congress earmarked $34 million for UNFPA, subject, however, to the Kemp-Kasten conditions. The conference agreement further directed how the previously withheld money would be disbursed, thereby resolving a long-standing dispute over whether to commit these resources to other development programs or place them in a reserve account in case UNFPA again became eligible for U.S. support. The FY2004 appropriation specified that the $34 million withheld in FY2002 shall be used for family planning programs in twelve countries, including Congo, Ethiopia, Uganda, Haiti, and Russia.

During the mid-1980s, in what has become known as the \"Mexico City\" policy (because it was first announced at the 1984 Mexico City Population Conference), the Reagan Administration, and later the George H. W. Bush Administration, restricted funds for foreign non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that were involved in performing or promoting abortions in countries where they worked, even if such activities were undertaken with non-U.S. funds . Several groups, including International Planned Parenthood Federation-London (IPPF-London), became ineligible for U.S. financial support. In some subsequent years, Congress narrowly approved measures to overturn this prohibition, but White House vetoes kept the policy in place. President Clinton in 1993 reversed the position of his two predecessors, allowing the United States to resume funding for all family planning organizations so long as no U.S. money was used by those involved in abortion-related work.", "Between 1996 and 2000, the House and Senate took opposing positions on the Mexico City issue, actions that repeatedly held up enactment of the final Foreign Operations spending measures. The House position, articulated by Representative Chris Smith (N.J.) and others, supported reinstatement of the Mexico City policy restricting U.S. aid funds to foreign organizations involved in performing abortions or in lobbying to change abortion laws or policies in foreign countries. The Senate, on the other hand, rejected in most cases House provisions dealing with Mexico City policy, favoring a position that left these decisions in the hands of the Administration. Unable to reach an agreement satisfactory to both sides, Congress adopted interim arrangements during this period that did not resolve the broad population program controversy, but permitted the stalled Foreign Operations measure to move forward. The annual \"compromise\" removed House-added Mexico City restrictions, but reduced population assistance to $385 million, and in several years, \"metered\" the availability of the funds at a rate of one-twelfth of the $385 million per month.", "In FY2000, when the issue became linked with the separate foreign policy matter of paying U.S. arrears owed to the United Nations, a reluctant President Clinton agreed to a modified version of abortion restrictions, marking the first time that Mexico City conditions had been included in legislation signed by the President (enacted in the Foreign Operations Act for FY2000, H.R. 3422 , incorporated into H.R. 3194 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000, P.L. 106-113 ). Because the President could waive the restrictions for $15 million in grants to organizations that refused to certify, there was no major impact on USAID family planning programs in FY2000, other than the reduction of $12.5 million in population assistance that the legislation required if the White House exercised the waiver authority.", "When Congress again came to an impasse in FY2001, lawmakers agreed to allow the new President to set policy. Under the FY2001 Foreign Operations measure, none of the $425 million appropriation could be obligated until after February 15, 2001.", "Subsequently, on January 22, 2001, two days after taking office, President Bush issued a Memorandum to the USAID Administrator rescinding the 1993 memorandum from President Clinton and directing the Administrator to \"reinstate in full all of the requirements of the Mexico City Policy in effect on January 19, 1993.\" The President further said that it was his \"conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortions or to advocate or actively promote abortion, either here or abroad.\" A separate statement from the President's press secretary stated that President Bush was \"committed to maintaining the $425 million funding level\" for population assistance \"because he knows that one of the best ways to prevent abortion is by providing quality voluntary family planning services.\" The press secretary further emphasized that it was the intent that any restrictions \"do not limit organizations from treating injuries or illnesses caused by legal or illegal abortions, for example, post abortion care.\" On February 15, 2001, the day on which FY2001 population aid funds became available for obligation, USAID issued specific policy language and contract clauses to implement the President's directive. The guidelines are nearly identical to those used in the 1980s and early 1990s when the Mexico City policy applied.", "Critics of the certification requirement oppose it on several grounds. They believe that family planning organizations may cut back on services because they are unsure of the full implications of the restrictions and do not want to risk losing eligibility for USAID funding. This, they contend, will lead to higher numbers of unwanted pregnancies and possibly more abortions. Opponents also believe the new conditions undermine relations between the U.S. Government and foreign NGOs and multilateral groups, creating a situation in which the United States challenges their decisions on how to spend their own money. They further argue that U.S. policy imposes a so-called \"gag\" order on the ability of foreign NGOs and multilateral groups to promote changes to abortion laws and regulations in developing nations. This would be unconstitutional if applied to American groups working in the United States, critics note.", "Supporters of the certification requirement argue that even though permanent law bans USAID funds from being used to perform or promote abortions, money is fungible; organizations receiving American-taxpayer funding can simply use USAID resources for permitted activities while diverting money raised from other sources to perform abortions or lobby to change abortion laws and regulations. The certification process, they contend, closes the fungibility \"loophole.\"", "Since reinstatement of the Mexico City policy in early 2001, several bills have been introduced to reverse the policy, but except for language included in the Senate FY2004 Foreign Operations appropriations bill ( S. 1426 ), none has passed either the House or Senate, and no measure has been enacted into law."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congressional Action", "paragraphs": ["The Conference agreement on H.R. 4818 provides $441 million for bilateral family planning/reproductive health programs, between levels passed earlier by the House ($432 million) and the Senate ($450 million).

Conferees further specified that FY2004 funds previously earmarked for UNFPA be spent on anti-trafficking programs ($12.5 million) and family planning and maternal and reproductive health activities ($12.5 million).

The first provision passed by the Senate but dropped in conference amended the Kemp-Kasten language in a way that would narrow somewhat the grounds on which the Administration could find UNFPA in violation of the restrictions. The Senate text stated that an organization must directly support coercive abortions or involuntary sterilizations in order to be denied U.S. support, adding the word \"directly\" to the condition. The amendment further included new text stating that no organization can be denied funds solely because the government of a country engaged in coercive practices. This presumably was an indirect reference to China, intending to establish a policy that UNFPA could be declared ineligible for U.S. funding exclusively because of coercive practices by Chinese family planning officials.", "The second Senate amendment would have revised the President's \"Mexico City\" policy that prohibits foreign non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from receiving U.S. funds if they perform or promote abortion as a method of family planning, whether or not such activities are supported with U.S.-provided resources. The Senate-passed language stipulated that foreign NGOs could not be declared ineligible for U.S. aid for conducting any health or medical services with non-U.S. government funds so long as the practices did not violate laws in the country in which the services were provided or would not violate U.S. law. The provision further provided that foreign NGOs would not be subject to conditions associated with the use of non-U.S. government funds for advocacy and lobbying activities that were more restrictive than those applied to American NGOs.

As of November 17, $8.9 billion (48%) had been obligated, and $1.8 billion (10%) expended. Among reasons for the slow progress were pressures to employ open and competitive bidding for most of the new reconstruction contracts, last year's inter-agency disputes over control of the funds, and a variety of federal regulations. Security concerns, however, have been chiefly responsible for delaying reconstruction further. To speed up the reconstruction process, in April CPA Ambassador Bremer initiated the Accelerated Iraqi Reconstruction Program (AIRP) which utilizes Iraqi DFI funds ($383 million) to get work underway in ten cities. The AIRP effort is coordinated with the use of CERP funds (see below). The recent re-allocation of reconstruction funds is, in part, intended to speed up implementation, including the expanded use of smaller projects. Further, Ambassador Negroponte has argued for greater flexibility in the application of federal acquisition regulations. The FY2004 Defense Authorization ( P.L. 108-375 ) would permit such regulations to be waived for the CERP program (sec. 1201 (c)).", "While most reconstruction activities provide needed infrastructure and services, some far-reaching economic and political policy reforms promoted by the CPA stirred controversy in Iraq, especially as they were viewed as imposed by an occupying administration.

On September 29, Congress cleared H.J.Res. 107 , a Continuing Resolution for FY2005. The measure enacted into law some elements included in H.R. 4818 and proposed by the Administration. Specifically, H.J.Res. 107 :", "approved sector funding re-allocations, as proposed by the Administration on September 14 (see Table 16 , above for details); authorized $360 million for the costs of canceling roughly $4 billion in Iraqi debt owed to the United States; and transferred responsibility for submitting a quarterly report (\"section 2207 report\") on the use of Iraq reconstruction funds from OMB to the Department of State.", "Also, in the Defense Department Authorization bill for FY2005 (Sec. 1059B of H.R. 4200 , as cleared by Congress on October 9), Congress extended CPA-IG by re-designating the office as the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction and granting operational authority until 10 months after 80% of the reconstruction funds have been obligated."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "For Additional Reading", "paragraphs": ["Overview", "CRS Report 98-916.
