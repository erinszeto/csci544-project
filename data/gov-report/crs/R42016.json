The proposal represents the latest renovation of the mail and wire fraud statutes constructed in response to more circumspect Supreme Court interpretation of those provisions. Federal public corruption statutes have a long history. Federal bribery statutes date back almost to the dawn of the Republic. The mail fraud statute, which forbids the use of the mail in conjunction with a scheme to defraud another of money or property, originated in the mid-eighteenth century. The mail fraud statute's companion, the wire fraud statute, was enacted in the mid-twentieth century. Shortly thereafter, federal officials had begun to prosecute corrupt state and local officials under the federal mail and wire fraud statutes. Application of the statutes to public corruption was based on the theory that the mail and wire fraud statutes protected both tangible as well as intangible property and that such intangible property included the right of an employer or the public to the honest services of an employee or public official:", "An increasing number of courts ... have held that a recreant employee can be prosecuted [for mail fraud] under \u00a71341 if he breaches his allegiance to his employer by accepting bribes or kickbacks in the course of his employment, since such conduct defrauds the employer of his right to the employee's honest and faithful services. Similar schemes devised by public officials have been viewed as defrauding state or municipal citizens of the same intangible right.", "The Supreme Court, however, found that interpretation too open ended. In McNally , it declared that, \"[r]ather than construe the statute in a manner that leaves its outer boundaries ambiguous and involves the Federal Government in setting standards of disclosure and good government for local and state officials, we read \u00a71341 as limited in scope to the protection of property rights.\" ", "Congress answered McNally with the enactment of 18 U.S.C. 1346, which defines the term \"scheme to defraud\" in mail and wire fraud statutes to include schemes to \"deprive another of the intangible right to honest services.\"", "Faced with vagueness challenges, the lower federal courts devised a number of standards to limit the scope of honest services mail and wire fraud. Rather than endorse any of these standards, the Supreme Court in Skilling opted for a narrow construction of honest services fraud. It concluded that \"[i]n proscribing fraudulent deprivations of 'the intangible right to honest services,' \u00a71346, Congress intended at least to reach schemes to defraud involving bribes and kickbacks. Construing the honest-services statute to extend beyond that core meaning ... would encounter a vagueness shoal.\" As it had done in McNally , the Court in Skilling urged Congress to speak clearly should it elect to expand the reach of honest services mail and wire fraud.", "H.R. 2572 and Title II would each expand the mail and wire fraud definition of the term \"scheme to defraud\" to include a scheme \"by a public official to engage in undisclosed self-dealing.\" The proposals would cover federal, state, and local officials, employees, and agents. \"Undisclosed self-dealing\" has two components in the bills. One involves a conflict of interest; the other an obligation to disclose it.", "The first encompasses a public official's performance of an official act for the purpose, at least in material part, of furthering his own financial interest or that of a spouse, minor child, close business associate, or in some instances, that of someone from whom the official has received something of value. Official acts include those actions, decisions, and courses of action that come within the official's duties. ", "The second element of undisclosed self-dealing consists of the public official's knowingly failing to disclose material information that he is required by law to disclose. \"Material information,\" as the term is used in the second element is defined to include information relating to pertinent financial matters of the covered officials and those covered by virtue of their relation to those officials. ", "The proposal defines neither \"material,\" \"any thing or things of value,\" nor \"financial interest,\" as those terms are used in the first element. The omissions may not be problematic. In the absence of a statutory definition, interpretation begins with the ordinary meaning of a term, and may take into account how the term is defined or understood in similar contexts. The dictionary describes \"material\" as something \"having real importance or great consequences.\" In the context of other statutes relating to fraudulent conduct, something is considered material \"if it has a natural tendency to influence\" a decision. The bills speak of a public official performing an act for \"the purpose, in whole or in material part, of furthering or benefitting a financial interest.\" This would seem to mean that an intent to further or benefit a particular financial interest must play an important or influential part in the official's decision to perform the act.", "The terms \"thing of value,\" or \"anything of value\" are likewise used with some regularity elsewhere in federal criminal law. There is some suggestion that \"anything of value\" should be read more broadly as \"all things of value.\" In any event, the terms \"thing of value\" and \"anything of value\" are understood to refer to a diverse range of both tangible and intangible things including campaign contributions, employment, sex, expunged criminal records, and casual pretrial release supervision. ", "The meaning of \"financial interest\" may be a little less transparent. It is not a term regularly used or defined in federal criminal law, but it is a familiar concept in federal conflict of interest provisions. A Justice Department witness emphasized this point when she testified at a congressional hearing on the House bill, \"[I]n order to define the scope of the financial interests that underlie improper self-dealing, the provision draws content from the well-established federal conflict-of-interest statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7208, which currently applies to the federal Executive Branch.\" Perhaps more to the point, the proposed undisclosed self-dealing section only applies to those financial interests which the law obligates the public official to disclose. The qualifying reporting statute or regulation would ordinarily make clear the financial interests whose disclosures it requires.", "In the Justice Department's endorsement of the proposal the same witness testified that, \"[U]nder the proposed statute, no public official could be prosecuted unless he or she knowingly conceals, covers up, or fails to disclose material information that he or she is already required by law or regulation to disclose. Because the bill would require the government to prove knowing concealment and that any defendant acted with the specific intent to defraud, there is no risk that a person can be convicted for unwitting conflicts of interest or mistakes.\"", "A representative of the criminal defense bar, however, criticized the proposal as constitutionally suspect, contrary to federalism principles, duplicative, and overly simplistic. He argued that the section fails to heed Skilling Court's plea for clarity. He envisioned First Amendment implications in the proposal's application to campaign contributions to elected officials. He also characterized the proposal as a \"classic example of overcriminalization\" that would replicate existing law and intrude upon state prerogatives. Finally, the witness contended that the proposal is at odds with the realities of part-time legislators and other state and local officials.", "Even after Skilling , the honest services mail and wire fraud statutes reach bribery and kickbacks, and the statutes unadorned reach money and property-depriving schemes. The proposal would add unreported self-dealing in public corruption cases. It leaves unchanged the law governing self-dealing in private cases."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Bribery and Gratuity Changes", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Section 201", "paragraphs": ["The bills also seek to overcome Sun Diamond and Valdes , two judicial interpretations of the basic federal bribery and illegal gratuities statute, 18 U.S.C. 201. Subsection 201(b) outlaws soliciting or offering anything of value in exchange for an official act. Subsection 201(c) outlaws soliciting or offering anything of value in gratitude (\"for or because of\") for the performance of an official act. The distinction between the two is the corrupt bargain, the illicit quid pro quo, that marks bribery.", "The issue in Sun Diamond was whether an illegal gratuities conviction might be based solely on gifts given a public official because of his office, without reference to any particular official act, or whether the conviction could only stand if gifts were sought or provided with a specific official act in mind. The Supreme Court unanimously concluded that \"in order to establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7201(c)(1)(A), the Government must prove a link between a thing of value conferred upon a public official and a specific 'official act' for or because of which it was given.\" Justice Scalia, writing for the Court, asserted this construction, along with the definition of a qualifying \"official act,\" precluded unintended application of the gratuities subsection:", "Besides thinking that this is the more natural meaning of \u00a7201(c)(1)(A), we are inclined to believe it correct because of the peculiar results that the Government's alternative reading would produce. It would criminalize, for example, token gifts to the President based on his official position and not linked to any identifiable act\u2014such as the replica jerseys given by championship sports teams each year during ceremonial White House visits. Similarly, it would criminalize a high school principal's gift of a school baseball cap to the Secretary of Education, by reason of his office, on the occasion of the latter's visit to the school. That these examples are not fanciful is demonstrated by the fact that counsel for the United States maintained at oral argument that a group of farmers would violate \u00a7201(c)(1)(A) by providing a complimentary lunch for the Secretary of Agriculture in conjunction with his speech to the farmers concerning various matters of USDA policy\u2014so long as the Secretary had before him, or had in prospect, matters affecting the farmers. Of course the Secretary of Agriculture always has before him or in prospect matters that affect farmers, just as the President always has before him or in prospect matters that affect college and professional sports, and the Secretary of Education matters that affect high schools.", "The official act requirement plays no less significant a role in avoiding unintended coverage, for as the Court observed", "It might be said in reply to this that the more narrow interpretation of the statute can also produce some peculiar results. In fact, in the above-given examples, the gifts could easily be regarded as having been conferred, not only because of the official's position as President or Secretary, but also (and perhaps principally) \"for or because of\" the official acts of receiving the sports teams at the White House, visiting the high school, and speaking to the farmers about USDA policy, respectively. The answer to this objection is that those actions\u2014while they are assuredly \"official acts\" in some sense\u2014are not \"official acts\" within the meaning of the statute, which, as we have noted, defines \"official act\" to mean \"any decision or action on any question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy, which may at any time be pending, or which may by law be brought before any public official, in such official's official capacity, or in such official's place of trust or profit.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7201(a)(3) . Thus, when the violation is linked to a particular \"official act,\" it is possible to eliminate the absurdities through the definition of that term . When, however, no particular \"official act\" need be identified, and the giving of gifts by reason of the recipient's mere tenure in office constitutes a violation, nothing but the Government's discretion prevents the foregoing examples from being prosecuted.", "The bills would enlarge both the illegal gratuities prohibition and the definition of \"official acts\" that constitute elements of the bribery as well as the illegal gratuities offense. They would also devise alternative means of avoiding the type of unintended results mentioned in Sun Diamond .", "First, they would amend the proscriptions of subsection 201(c) to prohibit offering or soliciting a gift for or because of \"the official's or person's official position,\" in order to supplement the existing prohibition against gifts for or because of an \"official act.\" The amendment would bring within the scope of the illegal gratuities subsection \"status\" and \"good will\" gifts and contributions, without requiring prosecutors to show that they were sought or provided with an eye to any specific official act. As the committee report from the earlier Congress explained, \"This [would] allow the statute to reach its intended range of corrupt conduct, including benefits flowing to public officials designed to curry favor for non-specified future acts or to build a reservoir of good will.\"", "Second, they would amend the gratuities offense to create a safe harbor for gifts and campaign contributions permitted by rule or regulation, a term which the bills would define for both bribery and illegal gratuities purposes. The earlier committee report noted that in any event most campaign contributions would not be implicated by the gratuities prohibition. It explains that the prohibition is confined to things given to the official personally, and that campaign contributions ordinarily are not. The report also confirmed that the exception would help avoid the \"horribles\" found in Justice Scalia's Sun Diamond opinion. Yet the report may have introduced a hint of ambiguity in the exception when it suggested that rules or regulations would rest beyond the pale, if they left the particulars of an exception to individual Member or agency discretion. ", "Third, the bills would establish a $1,000 threshold for the illegal gratuities offenses, although each does so in its own distinctive manner. H.R. 2572 would limit the offenses in 18 U.S.C. 201\u2014bribery and illegal gratuities alike\u2014to cases involving $1,000 or more. Title II would apply the $1,000 limitation only in the case of illegal gratuity status gifts.", "Finally, the bills would amend the definition of \"official act,\" applicable to both the bribery and gratuities offenses, as to encompass activities \"within the range\" of official duty. The change is designed to repudiate the construction of the term \"official act\" announced by the D.C. Court of Appeals in Valdes . Valdes, a police officer, had received cash in connection with license plate identification and outstanding warrant information he had provided an informant he believed to be a judge. Indicted for bribery, Valdes was convicted of the lesser included offense of receiving an illegal gratuity. The Court of Appeals reversed, declaring, \"\u00a7201 is not about officials' moonlighting, or their misuse of government resources, or the two in combination.\" Instead, the term \"any question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\" in the definition of official act \"refers to a class of questions or matters whose answer or disposition is determined by the government,\" the court held. Not every subsequent federal appellate court has concurred. The phrase \"any act within the range of official duty,\" is designed to overcome the Valdes interpretation of \"official act,\" and \"to ensure that the bribery statute applies to all conduct of a public official within the range of the official's duties.\"", "The bills would add the term \"course of conduct\" to the definition of official act to avoid requiring prosecutors to \"establish a one-to-one link between a specific payment and a specific official act.\" The change would apply to both bribery and illegal gratuity offenses. The bills' illegal gratuity subsection would feature a safety valve for campaign contributions. The bribery subsection would not.

This change is long overdue in view of the District's unique status, and it comports with the overarching statutory scheme because the District is already included in the federal bribery statute (18 U.S.C. 201) and the statute governing theft and bribery from programs receiving federal funds (18 U.S.C. 666).
