(1) The term \"appropriations\" generallyrepresents total fundsavailable, including regular annual and supplemental appropriations, as well asrescissions, transfers, and deferrals. Increases and decreases generally are calculatedon comparisons between the funding levels appropriated for FY2002 and requestedby the President or recommended by Congress for FY2003. The FY2003 requestscontained some substantial changes in agencies' budgets from the FY2002 levels. Increases were proposed for some agencies, including the Indian Health Service($+56.5 million), Bureau of Indian Affairs ($+32.9 million), Minerals ManagementService ($+13.6 million), Smithsonian Institution ($+ 9.1 million), and the U.S. Fishand Wildlife Service ($+6.9 million).

Interior SecretaryNorton testified on topics including the Cooperative Conservation Initiative,landowner partnerships and other conservation tools, Indian trust funds, Indianeducation, the maintenance backlog of the National Park Service, Evergladesrestoration, funds for the National Wildlife Refuge System, the CooperativeEndangered Species Conservation Fund, energy programs and activities, land useplanning, wildland fire management, homeland security, and assistance to territoriesand freely associated states. Members also questioned the Secretary regardingproposed cuts to the U.S. Geological Survey and the proposed transfer of its toxicsubstances program to the National Science Foundation, and the Administration'sexamination of workforce restructuring and privatizing jobs. Also addressed duringquestioning were the strategic petroleum reserve; oil and gas exploration, includingthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; the Klamath Basin; and the proposedelimination of the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery program.

On July 9, 2002, the Committee marked up theserecommendations, and on July 11, 2002, H.R. 5093 was reported( H.Rept. 107-564 ). The measure was debated in the House on July 16 and 17, andpassed, amended, on July 17, 2002 (377-46). The House bill was sent to the Senateand placed on the Senate calendar on July 18, 2002. ", "The Senate development of its Interior appropriations bill began when the Senate Appropriations Interior Subcommittee held a hearing on June 13, 2002. Interior Secretary Norton testified, voicing similar concerns as in her Housetestimony. The Secretary also emphasized that the Administration requested funds for enhanced security measures, including $23.7 million for the National ParkService to begin construction of enhanced security systems at the WashingtonMonument and the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials. Bypassing subcommitteemarkup, on June 27, 2002, the Senate Committee on Appropriations marked up andordered reported its FY2003 funding recommendations.

", "On September 4, 2002, the Senate began consideration of H.R. 5093 , the House funding bill, with the Senate version as a substitute amendment. The Senate debated the bill for 10 days, agreeing to a number of amendments, butdiscontinued debate on September 25, 2002. The Senate did not pass an Interiorfunding bill in the 107th Congress. Controversies involving funding for, andmanagement of, wildfires were largely responsible for the protracted debate and lackof a vote on final passage. There were unsuccessful attempts to invoke cloture on awildland fire amendment offered by Sen. Byrd (No. 4480) to provide $825 millionin FY2002 emergency funds for firefighting costs. An amendment by Sen. Craig(No. 4518) on forest thinning was a major focus of the floor debate, with noresolution. Both fire amendments remained pending when the Senate discontinueddebate on the bill. (For more information, see \"U.S. Forest Service\" below.) ", "The Senate debated other contentious issues. On September 10, 2002, the Senate adopted a second degree amendment (No. 4481) to provide an estimated $6billion in farm disaster/drought relief assistance.

For Interior and related agencies, the Senate bill contained $18.97 billion forFY2003, and $825 million for FY2002 to replace monies spent on wildfire fighting,for a bill total of $19.80 billion. These figures do not reflect across-the-board cutscontained in the omnibus measure, as it is unclear how they would be calculated forthe Interior and related agencies bill overall and for particular departments, agencies,and programs in the bill. Specifically, the omnibus bill contained an across-the-boardrescission of 1.6%. Another section of the bill requires an increase to that rescissionby the amount necessary to offset $5 billion in additional education spending. According to CBO, this amount could generate an additional 1.252% reduction, fora total reduction in the Senate-passed bill currently estimated at 2.852%.

Although the Senate-passed bill did not specifically fund the Conservation SpendingCategory (Table 18) , the House bill provides $1.44 billion for FY2003, higher thanthe Administration ($1.32 billion). The House-passed bill provides higher fundingfor wildland fire fighting in FY2003 than the Senate or the Administration. Both theHouse and Senate proposed increases over FY2002 for the U.S. Geological Survey,while the Administration proposed a sizeable decrease for that agency.

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages approximately 264 million acresof public land for diverse, and at times conflicting uses, such as mineralsdevelopment, energy development, livestock grazing, recreation, and preservation. The agency also is responsible for about 700 million acres of federal subsurfacemineral resources throughout the nation, and supervises the mineral operations on anestimated 56 million acres of Indian Trust lands.

It is slightlyhigher than FY2002 ($1.87 billion). See Table 3 . ", "Management of Lands and Resources. For Management of Lands and Resources, Congress enacted $825.7 million forFY2003. This is a $50.1 million increase (6%) over FY2002 ($775.6 million). Thisline item funds an array of BLM land programs, including protection, recreationaluse, improvement, development, disposal, and general BLM administration. ", " Energy and Minerals. For the energy and minerals program, including Alaska minerals, for FY2003 Congress enacted $109.1 million, a $9.6million increase (10%) over FY2002 ($99.5 million). Congress supported, whilegoing beyond, the President's request for additional funds ($107.1 million) overFY2002. The Administration had sought the additional funds to increase theavailability of oil and gas on federal lands--a goal of the President's National EnergyPlan--including Alaska North Slope oil and gas development. In particular, theAdministration requested additional monies to expedite the permitting and rights ofway processes, increase oil and gas lease sales, evaluate and eliminate barriers toenergy production, and increase environmental inspections. The conferees on theInterior appropriations bill added funds beyond the request, for purposes includingpermitting and rights of way in Nevada and applications for permits to drill. ", "The FY2003 law retains Senate language related to the renewal of the right of way for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, a controversial right of way across federal lands. The language deems the Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for therenewal of the right of way to be sufficient to meet the requirements of \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd102(2)(C)of the National Environmental Policy Act, to preclude legal challenges to thedocument's sufficiency for that purpose. However, the FY2003 law droppedlanguage regarding another controversial right of way. The Senate-passed bill wouldhave prohibited appropriations for DOI from being used to issue a right of way fora pipeline related to the Cadiz Groundwater Storage and Dry-Year Supply Program. The Cadiz project was developed to store Colorado River water, for later use, in thegroundwater basin underlying parts of San Bernardino County in California. ", "The FY2003 law bars funds in the bill from being used for energy leasing activities within the boundaries of national monuments, as they were on January 20,2001, except where allowed by the presidential proclamations that created themonuments. Supporters of this language feared that the Administration could adjustthe boundaries of national monuments in order to allow energy leasing, whileopponents asserted that the language would preclude development of needed energyresources. An identical provision was enacted in FY2002. ", " Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. In earlier action, the House Committee on Appropriations had agreed to report language on the energy andminerals program in general, and also stating that no funds were included in theFY2003 funding bill \"for activity related to potential energy development within theArctic National Wildlife Refuge [ANWR]\" ( H.Rept. 107-564 , H.R. 5093 ). Section 1003 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act(ANILCA, P.L. 96-487 ) currently prohibits leasing \"or other development leading toproduction of oil and gas\" on ANWR lands (which were then known as the ArcticNational Wildlife Range), unless authorized by Congress. Thus, the Committee'sreport language generally was viewed as barring the use of funds for preleasingstudies and other preliminary work related to oil and gas drilling in ANWR. Thereport of the Senate Committee on Appropriations did not contain this prohibition. ", "Conferees on the FY2003 Interior appropriations bill included language in the joint explanatory statement stating that they \"do not concur with the House proposalconcerning funding for the energy and minerals program.\" This change from theHouse report language has been interpreted by some as potentially making availablefunds for preliminary work related to development in ANWR. However, as noted,the prohibition contained in ANILCA remains in effect, so the ability to use moneyin the bill may not be clear with respect to particular pre-leasing activities.", " Grazing. The FY2003 Interior appropriations law provides for the automatic renewal of grazing permits and leases that expire, are transferred,or waived during FY2003 and that were issued by the Secretary of the Interior or theSecretary of Agriculture. The automatic renewal continues until the permit renewalprocess is completed under applicable laws and regulations, including any necessaryenvironmental analyses. The terms and conditions in expiring permits or leaseswould continue under the new permit or lease until the renewal process is completed(except for certain Agriculture permits under the Senate bill). A provision inprevious appropriations laws contained similar language for the Secretary of theInterior but not for the Secretary of Agriculture. This controversial provision wasadvocated as necessary to address heavy agency workloads in processing the grazingpermits and leases that are up for renewal. Opponents fear that permits with possiblydetrimental terms or conditions could continue. ", " Land Use Planning. For FY2003, Congress enacted $47.6 million for land use planning, a substantial increase (44%) over the $33.0 millionappropriated for FY2002. All BLM lands (except some in Alaska) are covered bya land use plan, and plans are to be amended or revised as new issues arise andconditions change. The Senate, House, and Administration had sought increasedfunds over FY2002. The additional funds are to be used to initiate new land useplans and to accelerate the development or amendment of land use plans that areunderway to reflect current conditions, requirements, and issues. TheAdministration's priority is to address issues including increased energydevelopment, enhanced protection from wildfire, and resolution of resource conflicts. The additional funds are part of a multi-year effort to update land use plans, abouthalf of which are out of date, according to the BLM.", "Wildland Fire Management. For wildland fire management for FY2003, Congress enacted $654.4 million, a reductionfrom the FY2002 level ($678.4 million). The wildland fire funds appropriated toBLM are used for fire fighting on all Interior Department lands. Interiorappropriations laws also provide funds for wildland fire management to the ForestService (Department of Agriculture) for fire programs primarily on its lands. A focusof both departments is the National Fire Plan, developed after the 2000 fire season,which emphasizes reducing hazardous fuels, among other provisions. The confereesdid not concur with Senate report language requiring 70% of hazardous fuels fundsto be used in the wildland urban interface, on the grounds that existing collaborationwith communities and criteria for project selection are adequate for determining howto spend these funds. The FY2003 law also contains $189.0 million for DOI'swildland fire management to repay amounts transferred from other accounts for firefighting during FY2002. (For more information, see \"U.S. Forest Service\" below.)", "Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program (PILT). For PILT, Congress enacted $220.0 million, anincrease over FY2002 ($210.0 million). The Administration had sought significantlyless-- $165.0 million--for this program that compensates local governments forfederal land within their jurisdictions. The program has been controversial becausein recent years appropriations have been substantially less than authorized amounts. ", "Land Acquisition. For Land Acquisition, the FY2003 law contains $33.5 million, divided among 18 projects in8 states. This is a sizeable reduction (33%) from FY2002 ($49.9 million).

A breach-of-contract lawsuit was filed by nineoil companies seeking $1.2 billion in compensation for their undeveloped leases. The companies claim that MMS failed to conduct consistency determinationsrequired by the court. A federal statute, the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972(16 U.S.C. 1451) was amended in 1990 to allow for consistency determinations.Using this Act, the state of California could determine whether development of oiland gas leases are consistent with the state's coastal zone management plan. In 1999,the MMS extended 36 out of the 40 leases at issue by granting lease suspensions. However, in June 2001 the Ninth Circuit Court struck down the MMS suspensionsarguing that MMS failed to show consistency with the state's coastal zonemanagement plan. The Bush Administration appealed this decision January 11,2002, in the Ninth Circuit and proposed a more limited lease development plan thatinvolves 20 leases using existing platforms. The Court however upheld its decisionfavoring California. The Administration appealed the decision to the U.S. Court ofAppeals in San Francisco.

Current BIA reorganization proposals arise from issues and events related to trust funds and assetsmanagement. Historically, the BIA has been responsible for managing Indian tribes'and individuals' trust funds and trust assets. Trust assets include trust lands and thelands' surface and subsurface economic resources (e.g., timber, grazing lands, orminerals); trust asset management includes real estate services, processing oftransactions (sales, leases, etc.), surveys, appraisals, probate functions, land titlerecords activities, and other functions.

This led to a legislative reform act in 1994 and anextensive court case in 1996.

Whilea computerized trust fund accounting system, operated by OST, had been installedsuccessfully under the HLIP in 2000, a new computerized trust asset managementsystem drew much tribal, congressional, and court criticism. That criticism led thecurrent Secretary to have a consultant, Electronic Data Systems, Inc. (EDS), reviewthe trust asset system and the entire trust reform effort.", "EDS's 2001 reports included a recommendation for a single executive controlling trust reform. In late 2001, citing this recommendation, the Secretaryproposed to split off BIA's trust asset management responsibilities into a new Bureauof Indian Trust Asset Management (BITAM), and requested approval from bothAppropriations Committees for a reprogramming of FY2002 funds to carry out theBITAM reorganization. The Committees did not approve the reprogrammingrequest, instead directing the Secretary to consult with Indian tribes. Theconsultation process took place during much of 2002 through a joint tribal-DOI TrustReform Task Force. The great majority of commenting tribes opposed the BITAMproposal and many tribes and tribal organizations offered alternative plans. TheBIA's proposed FY2003 budget did not include the BITAM reorganization proposal(or a reprogramming request). The Senate Appropriations Committee's June 2002report ( S.Rept. 107-201 ) forbade the Secretary to implement the BITAM proposal orto use FY2003 funds for any action that would alter the BIA's tribal or individualtrust authority.

The latest stage of the IIM lawsuit relates to anhistorical accounting for IIM funds, to determine the amount of money owed to theplaintiffs. The FY2001 Interior appropriations conference report, and the FY2002House and conference reports, had directed DOI to develop a sampling methodologyfor IIM accounting, as DOI had intended to do, but required submission of the plan,with a cost-benefit analysis, to Congress prior to implementation. Both repeated theprohibition on allocating funds for an historical accounting before submission of theplan and report. The requested report was transmitted to the Committees in earlyJuly 2002 by the DOI's Office of Historical Trust Accounting. The plaintiffs in thelawsuit object to an historical accounting methodology and, using a differentmethodology based on federal and state leasing returns, have estimated that they areowed about $137 billion. Recently the district court held the Secretary of the Interiorand the Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs in contempt for continuing problems intrust management reform (following a trial on the contempt issues).

The discussion includes questions aboutfunding levels and locations for various fire protection treatments, such as thinningand prescribed burning to reduce fuel loads and clearing around structures to protectthem during fires. Another focus is whether logging and access roads help in firecontrol or exacerbate conflagrations. Still another issue is whether, and to whatextent, environmental analysis, public involvement, and challenges to decisionshinder fuel reduction activities. ", "National Fire Plan. The FY2003 funding debate continued the increased attention in recent years to wildfires and the damage they cause. The severe fire seasons in thesummers of 2000 and 2002 prompted substantial debates and proposals related to firecontrol and fire protection. The severe 2000 fire season led the ClintonAdministration to propose a new program, called the National Fire Plan, whichapplied to BLM lands as well as to Forest Service lands, with $1.8 billion tosupplement the $1.1 billion requested before the fire season began. The National FirePlan comprises the Forest Service wildland fire program and fire fighting on DOIlands; the DOI wildland fire monies are appropriated to the BLM. Congress largelyenacted the proposal for FY2001, adding money to the FY2001 request for wildfireoperations, fuel reduction, and burned area restoration, fire preparedness, andprograms to assist local communities. Total appropriations for the FY2001 NationalFire Plan, covering BLM and FS fire funds, were $2.89 billion. Many of theincreases were continued in FY2002, although the less severe 2001 fire season ledto decreases in fire suppression operations, restoration and rehabilitation, emergencycontingency funds, and private land fire assistance. The FY2002 National Fire Planwas funded at $2.24 billion.", "FY2003 Appropriations. For FY2003, the Bush Administration had proposed to fund the National Fire Plan at $2.02 billion, $216 million (10%) less than theFY2002 level. The FY2003 enacted appropriation was $2.03 billion, $11 million(1%) more than requested, but $204 million less than the FY2002 level. (See Table11 .) The appropriation is less than the House passed ($2.17 billion), but more thanthe Senate passed ($2.01 billion).", " Table 11.

The FY2003 enacted appropriation for suppression matchedthe decrease proposed in the President's FY2003 request by eliminating theemergency contingent funds for FY2002. (See Table 11 ). Specifically, theappropriation includes $160.4 million for the BLM for fire suppression, and $420.7million for FS fire suppression. This is a small decrease from BLM FY2002suppression funding (-$1.0 million), and a substantial decrease (nearly -$101million) from FS FY2002 suppression funding", "For BLM fire preparedness, the appropriation matched the President's request of $277.2 million, a slight reduction from the FY2002 level of $280.8 million. ForFS fire preparedness, the appropriation was $616.0 million, down from the FY2002level of $622.6 million. This roughly split the difference between the House-passedincrease (to $640.0 million), and the President's proposed and Senate-passedreduction (to $600.7 million). ", "For other BLM fire operations, the appropriation roughly matched the request and the House and Senate enactments of about $216 million, a reduction of about $20million from the FY2002 regular and emergency contingent appropriation. For otherFS fire operations, the appropriation was $343.2 million, down $4.5 million from therequest, and down $109.5 from the House, but up $12.9 million from the Senate. This is a decrease of $73.2 million from the $416.4 million appropriated for FY2002.", "FY2002 Supplemental Funds. The 2002 fire season also was severe, with conflagrations threatening towns in Colorado, Arizona, Oregon, and elsewhere. Asof November 15, 2002, wildfires had burned 7,112,733 acres, nearly as much as in2000, the most severe fire season since the 1950s. (17) The FS and BLM used theirFY2002 suppression funding, and borrowed from other accounts (such as landacquisition) as authorized. As a result, Congress and the Administration debatedwhether to include, in the FY2003 appropriation, supplemental funds for FY2002 torepay funds borrowed to pay for firefighting. In the FY2003 appropriations law,Congress ultimately enacted $825 million ($636 million for FS and $189 million forBLM) to repay the funds borrowed for FY2002 firefighting (Title III of Division N). ", "Whether to appropriate supplemental funds for FY2002, and at what level, had been a subject of much debate during consideration of the FY2003 appropriationsbill. The House had added $700 million in FY2002 funds to the FY2003 InteriorAppropriations bill for fire suppression ($500 million for FS and $200 million forBLM). In late August, the Administration requested $825 million ($636 million forFS and $189 million for BLM) to supplement the FY2002 firefighting efforts. During Senate floor consideration of H.R. 5093 , Sen. Byrd offered anamendment (No. 4480) to add the Administration's request to the Interior bill. Adraft substitute, widely attributed to Sen. Domenici, sought $1.25 billion ($1.0 billionfor FS and $250 million for BLM), but this amendment was not offered in the Senate. Instead, Sen. Craig offered an amendment (on behalf of himself and Sen. Domenici)to the Byrd amendment to allow hazardous wildfire fuel reduction projects with lessenvironmental and public review. The introduced amendment and various substituteswere debated sporadically from September 5 through September 25, with noresolution. The Senate twice tried to end debate on the fire issue by invoking clotureon the Byrd amendment, but neither attempt was successful. ", "Largely due to the lack of agreement on wildland fire funding and related issues, the Senate discontinued debate on the Interior appropriations bill in the 107thCongress. The Byrd and Craig/Domenici amendments remained pending when theSenate halted debate. The House Resources Committee persisted in consideringrelated authorizing legislation, but none was enacted in the 107th Congress. (SeeCRS Report RL31679.) ", "Stewardship Contracting. The FY2003 appropriations law included a provision extending the authorization for stewardship through 2013 to the BLM and to anunlimited number of FS contracts (\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd323 of Division F). This authority allows theagencies to require fuel reduction or other stewardship activities as part of timber salecontracts--essentially trading goods (timber) for services (e.g., fuel reduction). Supporters assert that this is an efficient way to achieve non-commercial benefitsusing commercial contracts. Opponents counter that this creates incentives to allowmore trees to be cut, so as to gain more non-commercial benefits, and grants theagencies too much discretion over the use of timber receipts. ", " Other Agency Programs. While funding for wildfires was the center of debate, Congress examined other Forest Service programs to determineFY2003 funding levels. The Administration had proposed terminating the EconomicAction Program (EAP), which includes rural community assistance and woodrecycling, and the Pacific Northwest economic assistance program.

The request also proposed reducing Infrastructure Improvement (which is used toaddress the nearly $7 billion deferred maintenance backlog) by $10.1 million (17%),to $50.9 million. The FY2003 appropriations law reduced this further, to $45.9million, while shifting $4.9 million to other capital improvements.", "The FY2003 budget request included a new Emerging Pest and Pathogens Fund, to rapidly control invasive species problems since early aggressive efforts can reduceor eliminate a problem while it is still small. The request was for $12.0 million, andthe Senate included $14.0 million, but the House included no money for this Fundand no FY2003 funds were enacted. The other new proposed program was $15.0million for Expedited Consultations, where the FS can pay another federal agency toconsult on projects that might jeopardize an endangered or threatened species; thiswould assure that the other agencies' budgets do not limit the FS's ability to proceedon its projects.

The 1974 relocationlegislation ( P.L. 93-531 , as amended) was the end result of a dispute between theHopi and Navajo tribes involving land originally set aside by the federal governmentfor a reservation in 1882. Pursuant to the 1974 act, lands were partitioned betweenthe two tribes. Members of one tribe who ended up on the other tribe's land were tobe relocated. ONHIR classifies families as relocated when they occupy theirreplacement home. Most relocatees are Navajo. A large majority of the estimated3,477 Navajo families formerly on the land partitioned to the Hopi already haverelocated under the Act, but the House Appropriations Committee estimates thatabout 233 families (almost all Navajo) have yet to complete relocation, includingabout 24 Navajo families still on Hopi partitioned land (some of whom refuse torelocate). The remaining families are not on Hopi partitioned land but are in variousstages of acquiring replacement housing. ONHIR's chief activities consist of housingacquisition and construction, land acquisition, and certification of families' eligibilityfor relocation benefits.", "For FY2002, ONHIR received appropriations of $15.1 million.

In 1995, the United States and the Hopi Tribereached a proposed settlement agreement on Hopi claims. Attached to the settlementagreement was a separate accommodation agreement between the Hopi Tribe and theNavajo families, which provided for 75-year leases for Navajo families on Hopipartitioned land. The Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute Settlement Act of 1996 ( P.L.104-301 ) approved the settlement agreement between the United States and the HopiTribe. Not all issues have been resolved by these agreements, however, andopposition to the agreements and the leases is strong among some of the Navajofamilies. Navajo families with homesites on Hopi partitioned land faced a March 31,1997, deadline for signing the leases (accommodation agreements). According toONHIR, 70 of the 73 Navajo families then on Hopi-partitioned land had signedaccommodation agreements by the end of September 1999.", "The Hopi Tribe has called for enforcement of relocation against Navajo families without leases. Like the FY1997-FY2002 Interior appropriations acts, the FY2003appropriations law would forbid ONHIR from evicting any Navajo family from Hopipartitioned lands unless a replacement home were provided. This language appearsto prevent ONHIR from forcibly relocating Navajo families during FY2003 since theONHIR has a large backlog of relocatees who are approved for replacement homesbut have not yet received them. These relocatees would have priority in receivingreplacement homes. The settlement agreement approved by P.L. 104-301 , however,allows the Hopi Tribe under certain circumstances to begin actions against the UnitedStates after February 1, 2000, for failure to give the Hopi \"quiet possession\" of allHopi-partitioned lands if Navajo families on these lands have not either relocated orentered into accommodation agreements with the Hopi Tribe.

Other opponents argue that culture can and does flourish on its ownthrough private support. Proponents of federal support for arts and humanitiescontend that the federal government has a long tradition of support for culture,beginning as early as 1817 with congressional appropriations for works of art toadorn the U.S. Capitol. Some representatives of the private sector say that they areunable to make up the gap that would be left by the loss of federal funds for the arts.Others argue that abolishing NEA and NEH would curtail or eliminate the programsthat have national significance and purpose (such as national touring theater anddance companies, radio and television shows, traveling museum exhibitions, etc.) Former President Clinton's Committee on the Arts, in Creative America (1997),recommended federal funding for NEA and NEH at $2.00 per person by the year2000. In contrast, total funding for NEA and NEH now represents approximately 84cents per person. ", " Previous NEA Controversies. Although there appears to be an increase in congressional support for the NEA, the debate often recurs on previousquestionable NEA grants when appropriations are considered, in spite of attempts toresolve these problems through previous statutory provisions. The debate involvedwhether or not some of the grants given were for artwork that might be deemedobscene. To date, no NEA projects have been judged obscene by the courts. OnNovember 5, 1996, a federal appeals court upheld an earlier decision, NEA v. Finley ,ruling that applying the \"general standards of decency\" clause to NEA grants was\"unconstitutional.\" However, in anticipation of congressional reaction to NEA'sindividual grants, NEA eliminated grants to individuals by arts discipline with someexceptions. On June 25, 1998, the Supreme Court reversed the federal appeals courtdecision for NEA v. Finley (CA9,100F.3d 671) by a vote of 8 to 1, stating that theNEA \"can consider general standards of decency\" when judging grants for artisticmerit, and that the decency provision does not \"inherently interfere with Firstamendment rights nor violate constitutional vagueness principles.\" ", "Congress enacted NEA reform measures in past appropriations laws. Among these reforms were increases in funding allocations from 35% to 40% to states forbasic state arts grants and for grants to under served populations. In addition,language emphasizing arts education was included. A 15% cap was placed on NEAfunds allocated to each state, exempting only those grants with a national impact.Members of the House and Senate were added to the National Council on the Arts. Both NEA and NEH were given specific authority to solicit funding and to investthose funds. In the FY2003 final appropriation, the language is retained that has beenin previous appropriations related to funding priorities and restrictions on grants,including that no grant may be used generally for seasonal support to a group; and nogrants may be for individuals except for literature fellowships, National Heritagefellowships, or American Jazz Master fellowships.

The lower FY2003appropriation request of $532 million from the Bush Administration was in sharpcontrast with it's request for full funding for FY2002, and less than the $573 millionthat Congress provided in FY2002. The decline continued chronologically with eachstep in the FY2003 legislative process; the House passed less funding than theAdministration requested, then the Senate approved less funding then the House. The amount provided by the conference committee and enacted into law--$414million--is more than $100 million less than the House-passed total and is $50million less than the Senate-passed total. The amount enacted for FY2003 also issignificantly less than was appropriated in FY2000, FY2001, and FY2002.

", "In FY2003, The Bush Administration requested $200 million for the state grant program portion of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, of which $50 millionwould have funded a proposed Cooperative Conservation Initiative. This Initiativesought to promote conservation through partnerships that match BLM, NPS, andFWS funds with local contributions. In addition to the $50 million provided fromLWCF, the Administration sought another $50 million for the Initiative from theoperating accounts of the three DOI land management agencies, for a total of $100million. Congress did not fund this proposed Initiative, although the Houseexpressed strong interest in the concept on which it is based, of using programs thatcan leverage federal funds, identifying numerous opportunities. ", "Conservation Spending Category. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees created the ConservationSpending Category (CSC) in the FY2001 Interior appropriations law. The CSCcombines funding for about 2 dozen resource protection programs including theLWCF (it also includes some coastal and marine programs funded throughCommerce appropriations). This action was in response to the ClintonAdministration request for substantial funding increases in these programs under hisLands Legacy Initiative and widespread congressional interest in increasingconservation funding. The FY2001 law appropriated $1.21 billion for FY2001 (and$470 million through the Commerce appropriations law). The amount appropriatedin FY2001 through Interior appropriations was a substantial increase from a total of$557 million for these programs the preceding year. The FY2001 law also authorizedthat total spending under the category would grow each year, from $1.6 billion inFY2001 (of which $1.2 billion would be in Interior Appropriations programs) to $2.4billion in FY2006. All funding each year is subject to the appropriations process. ", "For FY2002, the Bush Administration did not use the framework of the CSC, but requested a total of $1.26 billion for this group of programs. Congress used thecategory and appropriated $1.30 billion. In its FY2003 budget request, again theAdministration did not use the CSC category. However, the House AppropriationsSubcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies estimated that the FY2003 requesttotaled $1.32 billion for programs in this category, a slight increase from FY2002funding. The House-passed bill provided $1.44 billion. The report accompanying theSenate-passed bill states that the CSC is not being used because the Budget Act inwhich it was established has expired and there is no budget resolution. It also statesthat total funding for FY2003 under this bill meets the aggregate total projected forthe CSC in FY2003. Neither the FY2003 appropriations law nor the accompanyingconference report contain calculations of FY2003 funding for the CSC. Rather, thejoint explanatory statement of the conference report states that no funds in the act arederived from the CSC, but that most of the programs previously funded under thatcategory are continued in FY2003.

Thealterations of the natural flow of water by a series of canals, levees, and pumpingstations, combined with agricultural and urban development, are thought to be theleading causes of environmental deterioration in the South Florida ecosystem. In1996, Congress authorized the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to create acomprehensive plan to restore, protect, and preserve the entire South Floridaecosystem, which includes the Everglades (P.L 104-303). A portion of thisplan--The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), completed in1999--provides for federal involvement in the restoration of the ecosystem. Congress authorized the Corps to implement CERP in the Water ResourcesDevelopment Act of 2000 (WRDA 2000; Title VI of P.L. 106-541 ). Based on CERPand other previously authorized restoration projects, the federal government, alongwith state, local, and tribal entities, is currently engaged in a collaborative effort torestore the South Florida ecosystem.", "The principal objective of CERP is to redirect and store \"excess\" freshwater currently being discharged to the ocean via canals, and use it to restore the naturalhydrological functions of the South Florida ecosystem. CERP seeks to deliversufficient water to the natural system without impinging on the water needs ofagricultural and urban areas. The federal government is responsible for half the costof implementing CERP, and the other half is borne by the State of Florida, and to alesser extent, local tribes and other stakeholders. CERP consists of 68 projects thatare expected to be implemented over approximately 36 years, with an estimated totalcost of $7.8 billion; the total federal share is estimated at $3.9 billion. (19)", "Restoration activities are conducted by federal agencies in the South Florida ecosystem under CERP and other laws. For example, for FY2003, Congressappropriated $90.0 million to the Corps for restoration work in Central and SouthernFlorida, yet only a portion of this total was appropriated for projects authorized byCERP. The remaining amount is expected to be for projects authorized by otherlaws, namely the Everglades National Park and Protection Act of 1989 ( P.L.101-229 ) and the Water Resources Development Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-303 ). FromFY1993 to FY2003, federal appropriations for projects and services related to therestoration of the South Florida ecosystem have exceeded $1.9 billion dollars, andstate funding has topped $3.6 billion. (20) Theaverage annual federal cost forrestoration activities in Southern Florida in the next 10 years is expected to beapproximately $286 million/year. (21) For FY2003,the administration requestedapproximately $260 million for restoration activities in the South Florida ecosystem,of which approximately $46 million was for the implementation of CERP. (22) Of theprojects and activities specified in the FY2003 appropriations conference report, over$180 million has been appropriated for restoration activities in the Everglades. (23)", "Appropriations for restoration projects in the South Florida ecosystem have been included in several annual appropriations laws. The Department of the Interior (DOI)and Related Agencies Appropriations laws have provided funds to several DOIagencies for restoration projects. Specifically, DOI conducts CERP and non-CERPactivities in Southern Florida through the National Park Service (NPS), Fish andWildlife Service (FWS), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and Bureau of IndianAffairs (BIA). For FY2003, the DOI requested $96.1 million for CERP andnon-CERP activities related to restoration in the South Florida ecosystem. Of thistotal, the NPS requested $70.4 million for land acquisition, construction, and researchactivities; the FWS requested $13.2 million for land acquisition, refuges, ecologicalservices, and other activities; the USGS requested $12.1 million for research,planning, and the Critical Ecosystem Studies Initiative; and the BIA requested $0.4million for water projects on Seminole and Miccosukee Tribal lands. See Table 16 .

These activities usually are part of a largercategory of funding and in some cases their funding is determined by the agenciesand reported later. ", "For restoration activities in the Everglades in FY2003, the DOI received approximately $30 million less than in FY2002. The primary reductions in fundingwere for the Modified Waters Delivery Project (from $35.2 million to $10.0 million)and land acquisitions conducted by the FWS ($8.5 million to $2.5 million). Appropriations for the Modified Waters Delivery Project were largely provided inprior fiscal years. The FY2003 level was $11.5 million less than theAdministration's request, including decreases of $5.0 million and $3.8 million forland acquisitions in the State of Florida to be conducted by the NPS and FWS,respectively. The FY2003 law provided the Fish and Wildlife Service with $1.8million to purchase land near the Pelican Island National Wildlife Reserve (NWR)and $0.8 million to purchase land near the Key Deer NWS. Other programs relatedto Everglades restoration were appropriated at the FY2003 requested levels. Thisincludes the Critical Ecosystem Initiative for $4.0 million; ecological services for theFish and Wildlife Service for $2.5 million; and surveys, investigations, and researchby the USGS for $8.1 million. The FY2003 appropriations law also authorizes theimplementation of a flood control plan (Alternative 6D) as part of the ModifiedWater Delivery Project. (See the Everglades section under the National Park Servicesection above.) ", "The Interior appropriations bills passed by the House and Senate had provided similar levels of funding for the NPS to conduct restoration activities in SouthernFlorida, with some exceptions. The $4.0 million for the Critical Ecosystem StudiesInitiative allocated to the NPS in the House bill was given to the USGS by theSenate. For the FWS, the Senate passed $3.3 million less for FWS land acquisitionsthan the House. Specifically, the Senate passed $1 million for the acquisition oflands at the J.N. Ding Darling National Wildlife Reserve and $1.5 million for theNational Key Deer Refuge; the House passed $3 million and $1.5 millionrespectively for the same lands, as well as $1.3 million for lands near the Pelican BayNational Wildlife Reserve. The FWS seeks to acquire these lands on the groundsthat doing so would benefit restoration activities in CERP. For BIA, the Houseprovided $0.3 million for water quality studies on the Seminole Indian Reservation,which was not included in the Senate- passed bill but contained in the FY2003appropriations law.", "There is little detailed information in either bill or report language about appropriations recommended for the FWS, USGS, and BIA for restoration activitiesin the South Florida ecosystem. Some of these restoration activities are part of largerprograms that are funded in appropriations bills. For example, the USGS proposesto collect data, construct models, and conduct studies in South Florida that areexpected to benefit restoration activities.
