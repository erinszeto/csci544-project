The minimum wage provisions of the FLSA have been amended numerous times since 1938, typically for the purpose of expanding coverage or raising the wage rate. Since its establishment, the minimum wage rate has been raised 22 separate times. The most recent change was enacted in 2007 (P.L. 110-28), which increased the minimum wage to its current level of $7.25 per hour.", "In addition to setting the federal minimum wage rate, the FLSA provides for several exemptions and subminimum wage categories for certain classes of workers and types of work. Even with these exemptions, the FLSA minimum wage provisions still cover the vast majority of the workforce. Despite this broad coverage, however, the minimum wage directly affects a relatively small portion of the workforce. Currently, there are approximately 2.2 million workers, or 2.7% of all hourly paid workers, whose wages are at or below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. Most minimum wage workers are female, are age 20 or older, work part time, and are in food service occupations.", "Proponents of increasing the federal minimum wage argue that it may increase earnings for lower income workers, lead to reduced turnover, and increase aggregate demand by providing greater purchasing power for workers receiving a pay increase.

In general, th e FLSA mandates broad general minimum wage coverage. It also specifies certain categories of workers who are not covered by FLSA wage standards, such as workers with disabilities or certain youth workers. The act was enacted because its provisions were meant to both protect workers and stimulate the economy.

To be covered, an enterprise must have at least two employees and must have annual sales or \"business done\" of at least $500,000.

The definition of interstate commerce is fairly broad. To be engaged in \"interstate commerce,\" employees must produce goods (or have indirect input to the production of those goods) that will be shipped out of the state of production, travel to other states for work, make phone calls or send emails to persons in other states, handle records that are involved in interstate transactions, or provide services to buildings (e.g., janitorial work) in which goods are produced for shipment outside of the state."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Exemptions and Subminimum Wages", "paragraphs": ["The FLSA covers most, but not all, private and public sector employees.

Employers may pay a minimum wage of $4.25 per hour to individuals under the age of 20 for the first 90 days of employment. Learners.

Full-Time Students. Employers may apply for special certificates from the Wage and Hour Division of DOL that allow them to pay full-time students who are employed in retail or service establishments, an agricultural occupation, or an institution of higher education a wage at least 85% of the federal minimum wage ($6.16 at the current minimum wage). Individuals with Disabilities. Employers may apply for special certificates from the Wage and Hour Division of DOL that allow them to pay wages lower than the otherwise applicable federal minimum to persons \"whose earning or productive capacity is impaired by age, physical or mental deficiency, or injury.\" As elaborated in regulations, disabilities that may affect productive capacity include, but are not limited to, blindness, mental illness, mental retardation, cerebral palsy, alcoholism, and drug addiction. There is no statutory minimum wage required under this provision of the FLSA, but pay is to be broadly commensurate with pay to comparable non-disabled workers and related to the individual's productivity. Tipped Workers. Under Section 203(m) of the FLSA, a \"tipped employee\"\u2014a worker who \"customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips\"\u2014may have his or her cash wage from an employer reduced to $2.13 per hour, as long as the combination of tips and cash wage from the employer equals the federal minimum wage. An employer may count against his or her liability for the required payment of the full federal minimum wage the amount an employee earns in tips. The value of tips that an employer may count against their payment of the full minimum wage is known as the \"tip credit.\" Under the current federal minimum wage and the current required minimum employer cash wage, the maximum tip credit is $5.12 per hour (i.e., $7.25 minus $2.13).

For example, a single parent with two children who works full-time, year-round at the current minimum wage has earnings of about 78% of the poverty line.
