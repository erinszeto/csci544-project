In addition, the federal individual income tax (hereinafter referred to simply as the income tax) increases the disposable income of many poor families via refundable tax credits\u00e2\u0080\u0094primarily the earned income tax credit (EITC) and the refundable portion of the child tax credit, referred to as the additional child tax credit, or ACTC. These credits are explicitly designed to benefit low-income families with workers and children and can significantly boost families' disposable income, lifting many of these families above the poverty line.", "Using the federal government's Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), CRS estimates that under current law, the income tax reduced total poverty by 15% (from 14.5% in poverty to 12.3% in poverty). The impact of the income tax on the overall poverty rate was larger than the impact of many needs-tested benefits programs targeted toward the poor. In contrast, the income tax's ability to lift the poorest Americans out of poverty\u00e2\u0080\u0094to reduce the \"poverty gap\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094was limited in comparison to many needs-tested programs. (The poverty gap is the difference between the poverty threshold and a family's disposable income, aggregated over all poor families, and is a measure of the degree of poverty.) CRS estimates that under current law, the income tax reduced the poverty gap by about $13.9 billion annually (from $150.8 billion to $136.9 billion), approximately half the effect of other needs-tested programs.", "Virtually all of the poverty reduction from the income tax\u00e2\u0080\u0094both in terms of reducing poverty rates and the poverty gap\u00e2\u0080\u0094was concentrated among families with children and workers. For example, CRS estimates that poverty among children who lived in families with workers fell by almost 40% (from 14.7% in poverty to 8.9% in poverty) as a result of the income tax. For nonaged (i.e., nonelderly) adults in families with children and workers, poverty fell by almost a third (from 12.3% in poverty to 8.3% in poverty). (In contrast, CRS estimates that the poverty rates among individuals who lived in families with no workers were unchanged by the income tax.) Similarly, all of the estimated $13.9 billion in poverty gap reduction from the current income tax occurred among families with children and workers.", "The current income tax includes the effects of legislative changes made by P.L. 115-97 , commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The TCJA made numerous changes to the federal income tax system, including many that affect individuals and families. A comparison of the effect of the current income tax (i.e., the post-TCJA income tax) and the pre-TCJA income tax on poverty rates and the poverty gap (assuming all else unchanged) provides one measure of the law's impact on poverty. CRS estimates suggest that the TCJA marginally reduced poverty rates and the poverty gap, with the impact of the post-TCJA income tax similar to the impact of the pre-TCJA income tax. This suggests the law provided relatively small benefits to poor families.", "Insofar as policymakers are interested in expanding the antipoverty impact of the income tax, they could expand or modify the EITC or ACTC, or create new refundable tax credits targeted toward the poor. However, refundable tax credits are subject to several limitations as a poverty reduction policy: the current credits primarily benefit those who work (and have children), limiting their ability to reduce poverty among those who do not or cannot work; they are received only once a year when income tax returns are filed, limiting their ability to help the poor meet ongoing basic needs; and they are difficult for the IRS to administer, subjecting the credits and their recipients to additional scrutiny."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The federal individual income tax is structured so that the poor owe little or no income tax (although they may pay other federal taxes, like payroll taxes as well as state and local taxes).

H.R. 3300 would temporarily increase the amount of the EITC for \"childless\" workers, allow all eligible taxpayers to receive the full amount of the ACTC, irrespective of a taxpayer's earned income, and make the child and dependent care tax credit refundable. To provide context for the consideration of new tax legislation, this report examines the relationship between the federal individual income tax and poverty.

", "The family is the unit of analysis. While federal income tax provisions affect taxpayers, the impact of these provisions is analyzed in terms of families. A taxpayer is generally composed of all individuals listed on a federal income tax return (IRS Form 1040) and includes an individual, his or her spouse (if married), and any dependents. Descriptions of the tax system pre- and post- TCJA will generally refer to how these changes applied to taxpayers (i.e., the below section titled, \" How Major Federal Income Tax Provisions Apply to the Poor \"). In contrast, poverty analysis is done at the family level since families can share many resources and expenses. Hence, in this report analyses of the impact of the income tax , pre- and post-TCJA, are generally done at the family level . In this report, a family is composed of people living together related by blood or marriage (the family), cohabiting partners, and foster children. In some cases, like multigenerational families, a family is composed of multiple taxpayers. In these cases, tax liabilities and/or benefits for all taxpayers are aggregated to determine the impact of the income tax on the family's resources. If a family is determined to be poor, all members of that family are counted as poor. ", "The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) is used to measure the poverty impact of the federal income tax. This report examines the impact of the pre- and post-TCJA federal income tax on poverty, using the federal government's Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM). Unlike the official poverty measure, the SPM was developed in part to help assess the effects of tax and government benefit policies on the economic well-being of low-income individuals.

The personal exemption is a per-person subtraction from gross income for the taxpayer and, if applicable, his or her spouse and dependents. Before enactment of the TCJA, the personal exemption would have equaled $4,150 per person in 2018. The TCJA effectively eliminated the personal exemption (reduced the amount to $0). When combined, the personal exemptions and the standard deduction represent an amount of income that is not subject to income taxation. As a result of these provisions, many low-income taxpayers have little or no taxable income and hence have little or no income tax liability. (Taxable income cannot be reduced below zero.)

"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Marginal Tax Rates", "paragraphs": ["A marginal tax rate is the tax incurred on each additional dollar of taxable income. Marginal tax rates in the individual income tax code are graduated, meaning the rate increases over successive ranges of taxable income. Many low-income taxpayers who do have taxable income pay taxes at the lowest marginal rate of 10%. The ranges of taxable income and their associated rate are often referred to as tax brackets . Taxpayers determine their tax liability before credits by applying marginal tax rates to their taxable income. Then taxpayers can subtract tax credits to determine their final tax liability. The 10% tax bracket (the lowest tax bracket) was unchanged by the TCJA. In general, marginal tax rates above the 10% rate were reduced under the TCJA.

Credits can be nonrefundable or refundable. Nonrefundable credits cannot exceed tax liability, and therefore can only reduce tax liability to zero. In other words, \"the maximum value of a nonrefundable credit is capped at a taxpayer's tax liability.\" For example, if a taxpayer owes $1,000 in income taxes and is eligible to receive $4,000 in nonrefundable tax credits, the taxpayer will receive only $1,000 in nonrefundable tax credits, reducing their income tax liability to zero. By contrast, refundable credits are not limited by how much a taxpayer owes in income taxes, meaning those with little to no tax liability, including may poor taxpayers, can receive the full value of the credit. A refundable tax credit provides a net benefit to a taxpayer (i.e., after-tax income is greater than before-tax income) when the amount of the credit is greater than the taxpayer's income tax liability. For example, if a taxpayer owes $1,000 in income taxes but receives $4,000 in refundable tax credits, the taxpayer has a net benefit (and negative tax liability) of $3,000. ", "The two major refundable tax credits claimed by low-income working taxpayers are the EITC and the additional child tax credit (the ACTC, which is the refundable portion of the child tax credit). The amount of the EITC is based on a taxpayer's earned income, marital status, and number of qualifying children. In 2018, before the TCJA, the maximum amount of the credit would have ranged from $520 to $6,444, depending on the number of qualifying children. The TCJA did not alter the EITC itself, though it did change the rules for adjusting it for inflation, which resulted in a slightly smaller EITC under the TCJA than under prior law (a difference of $1 to $13 in 2018, depending on the number of qualifying children claimed by a taxpayer). Before the TCJA the child tax credit equaled a maximum $1,000 per child, and up to the full amount ($1,000 per child) could be received as the ACTC. The ACTC was calculated as 15% of earned income over $3,000, not to exceed $1,000 per child. The TCJA increased the maximum child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 per child and increased the maximum amount of credit that could be claimed as the ACTC from $1,000 to $1,400 per child. The formula for calculating the ACTC was also modestly changed. Post-TCJA, the ACTC formula now equals 15% of earned income above $2,500, not to exceed $1,400 per child.

After the pre-TCJA income tax, the poverty rate fell to 12.5%, while after the post-TCJA income tax it fell to 12.3%. CRS estimates that before taxes, the aggregate poverty gap was $150.8 billion. After the pre-TCJA income tax it fell to $138.1 billion, while after the post-TCJA income tax it fell to $136.9 billion. These benefits went almost exclusively to individuals who lived in families with workers and children. ", "This analysis highlights both the importance of the tax system in reducing poverty, and also some of its limitations. As discussed in this report, the main mechanism by which the income tax reduces poverty is through refundable tax credits, primarily the EITC and the refundable portion of the child tax credit, the ACTC. These credits are available only to families who include a worker (and who generally have children) since their value is based in part on a taxpayer's earned income. Hence these credits provide little if any benefit to those who do not or cannot work, and who are more likely to be poor. ", "There are other limitations to using refundable tax credits to reduce poverty that are not discussed in this report. Notably, the EITC and child tax credit are received once a year as part of a taxpayer's refund after they file their federal income tax return, and are not paid out on a more periodic basis (i.e., monthly) to help families meet their basic needs. Addressing this limitation, the National Academy of Sciences, in its most recent report on reducing child poverty, proposed converting the child tax credit into a monthly child allowance. However, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may be ill-equipped to accurately and efficiently pay out tax benefits like the EITC and the child tax credit on a more periodic basis. Even on an annual basis, as they are currently paid out, these credits can be difficult for the IRS to administer and for taxpayers to comply with. The complexity of these tax credits is often cited as the main factor driving their high rate of erroneous claims. ", "Despite these limitations, and the limitations highlighted in this report, the income tax remains a popular (and near-universal) mechanism to provide aid to the working poor, especially those with children. Recent legislative proposals, including the Economic Mobility Act of 2019 ( H.R. 3300 ), would expand refundable tax credits, increasing the size of the EITC for workers without custodial children (the \"childless EITC\"), and increasing the ACTC to $2,000 ($3,000 for young children) for all low-income taxpayers irrespective of earned income. The stated purpose of this legislation is to help working families with children. And yet, by eliminating the phase-in for the ACTC, H.R. 3300 (and the American Family Act of 2019; S. 690 / H.R. 1560 ) also represents a shift in the target population of refundable tax credits, expanding eligibility to poor families with children that do not include a worker. Similarly, the proposed increase in the EITC for taxpayers without custodial children also reflects a shift from providing benefits only to workers with children (although childless EITC recipients may live in families with other children and/or have noncustodial children who do not live with them). Insofar as eligibility and the amount of refundable tax credits are expanded, the antipoverty effects of the income tax may increase.", "Appendix A. Methodology and Data Sources", "To examine how the federal individual income tax affects poverty, this report uses estimates from the Transfer Income Model, version 3 (TRIM3) and data from the Census Bureau's Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) to the Current Population Survey. TRIM3 is a static microsimulation model that estimates federal and state taxes and certain benefit transfer programs. TRIM3 is primarily funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and maintained by the Urban Institute. The measure of poverty used is the Census Bureau's Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM). ", "The Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplement to the Current Population Survey", "The ASEC is a household survey of the noninstitutionalized population conducted by the Census Bureau in March of each year. There are approximately 94,000 households in the ASEC. ", "The ASEC includes questions related to household members' demographic characteristics and family living arrangement at the time of the survey, and work experience and income in the prior year. This report's estimates are based on the 2017 ASEC, which captures information on work experience and income in the prior year\u00e2\u0080\u00942016. The ASEC is used by the U.S. Census Bureau to estimate both the official poverty measure and SPM poverty in its reports. The sample of the ASEC is large enough to make reliable estimates for the nation as a whole and, sometimes, for some of the larger states. However, the sample is not large enough to make state-level estimates for all states. ", "Estimates discussed in this report were weighted from the sample information to make the ASEC representative of the population of U.S. households. Since the estimates in this report come from a sample, they are subject to sampling error. Additionally, the information on the ASEC is based on respondents' answers to the survey questions, and nonresponse or incorrect responses can result in nonsampling error. ", "The ASEC itself does not ask survey respondents about taxes paid or refundable credits received in the prior year. That information\u00e2\u0080\u0094important for determining a family's or an individual's SPM poverty status\u00e2\u0080\u0094must be estimated. This report uses estimates from the TRIM microsimulation model for these estimates. The Census Bureau uses a different microsimulation model in its reports on SPM poverty.", "The TRIM3 Microsimulation Model", "Microsimulation models of tax and transfer programs are composed of computer code that mimics the rules of the tax code and benefit programs. The models determine whether an individual, family, or other unit is eligible to be subject to a tax or eligible for a benefit and then estimates the amount of the tax (or benefit). TRIM assumes that all taxpayers fully comply with the requirements and rules of the tax code. ", "Federal Income Tax Module for 2016", "TRIM3 applies policy rules in effect during the year to the population for that year. The estimates in this report use information from the TRIM3 federal income tax module for 2016. The 2016 federal income tax module makes \"baseline estimates\" of the tax code as it existed for 2016. The model uses data from the ASEC's information on family structure at the time of the survey to place individuals into federal tax filing units (e.g., taxpayer and, for those married filing jointly, the spouse). It also identifies \"extended\" tax filing units, which include dependents, and identifies \"qualifying children\" for the purpose of the EITC and the child tax credit. TRIM3 creates tax units not only for tax filers, but also for all potential filers. The model then uses information on the earnings and other income sources reported on the ASEC for 2016 to determine a tax filing unit's federal income tax liability.", "Additionally, expense and income items not available on the ASEC but required to compute federal income taxes were obtained through a statistical match with the IRS Statistics of Income Public Use File, which is based on a sample of tax returns. TRIM3 estimates of the elderly and disabled tax credit and the child and dependent care tax credit are aligned to target amounts based on IRS data.", "In terms of estimating federal income taxes, there are a number of caveats and limitations of the TRIM3 estimates. These limitations are not idiosyncratic to TRIM3 estimates. They generally result from limitations on the underlying ASEC data and are also present in estimates from the Census Bureau. These limitations include the following:", "Estimates are not reliable for very - high - income taxpayers . The estimates of federal income tax liability are not likely to be reliable for very-high-income taxpayers because the ASEC oversamples lower-income populations, rather than higher-income populations. Thus, TRIM3/ASEC estimates are most often used in reports (such as this report) that focus on lower-income populations. Amounts of refundable tax credits tend to be underestimated . The estimates from TRIM3 (as well as the Census Bureau's microsimulation model) underestimate refundable tax credits. For example, the TRIM3 estimate of the EITC for 2016 (pre-TCJA) was $39.2 billion. The total amount of the EITC claimed in 2016 according to the IRS was $66.7 billion. This discrepancy has long been known by researchers, but has yet to be fully explained. Potential reasons for the discrepancy include the information on the ASEC family structure perhaps not adequately representing that used for filing tax returns; the underreporting of certain forms of earnings (such as self-employment earnings); and the high rates of error made by taxpayers claiming the EITC.", "A Revised Federal Income Tax Module for Estimating Rules under the TCJA", "The Urban Institute, in partnership with the Congressional Research Service (CRS), modified TRIM3's federal income tax module to account for the major provisions of the TCJA affecting individual taxpayers. Thus, the information in the model was revised to reflect", "the new tax brackets and marginal tax rates that apply to them, the suspension of the personal exemption and the increases in the standard deduction, limitations on itemized deductions, including the limitation on the deductibility of state and local taxes (SALT), revised rules for the child tax credit, and other changes to the federal individual income tax code.", "TCJA Changes Not Modeled", "A number of changes to the federal income tax were not modeled. These include changes to the treatment of alimony, the mortgage interest deduction, and elimination of the individual mandate for health insurance. The treatment of alimony was not modeled because the changes will apply only to new or revised orders and will not affect many cases in the near term. Limits on interest qualifying for the mortgage interest deduction were not modeled since there are no data to inform the impact of these changes. Additionally, certain smaller changes are not present in the simulation, such as the elimination of the deduction for bicycle commuting. ", "Inflation Adjustment", "The post-TCJA tax code parameters were deflated to 2016 dollars to answer the question, \"What if the 2018 TCJA parameters were in place in 2016 and 2016 was the first year of their enactment?\" The adjustment was done using the chained Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (C-CPI-U), since the TCJA requires the use of that price index rather than the CPI-U for future price adjustments. Specifically, the 2018 amounts were adjusted to 2016 dollars using the chained CPI; see. Hence the estimates in this report reflect the impact of the post-TCJA tax code as if the first year of its enactment were 2016 (it actually went into effect in 2018).", "The Supplemental Poverty Measure", "The SPM was created to address some of the limitations of the official poverty measure. Particularly relevant for this analysis, the official poverty measure does not take into account taxes (and tax benefits, like refundable credits) and their impact on disposable income. It also does not take into account certain noncash government benefits, such as food benefits from SNAP or the value of housing benefits.", "The measure of total income in this analysis is computed similarly to the way the U.S. Census Bureau computes total financial resources, though there are a few differences. This analysis uses the TRIM3 estimates for TANF, SSI, and SNAP, rather than amounts reported on the ASEC, to address the underreporting of these income sources on the ASEC. Additionally, the measure of child care\u00e2\u0080\u0094deducted as a work expense for the SPM\u00e2\u0080\u0094differs. This analysis uses TRIM3's estimate of child care expenses, which includes estimated copayments for families receiving child care subsidies from the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG). The Census Bureau also caps child care expenses at the earnings of the lower-earning parent when determining net financial resources. This analysis deducts all child care expenses as a work-related expense of the family.", "Appendix B.

Stylized examples included at the end of each section help illustrate the impact of these changes for a hypothetical family. ", "Standard Deduction and Personal Exemptions", "The standard deduction and personal exemption, when combined, represent the minimum amount of income of a tax unit that is not taxed under the federal income tax. The standard deduction is a fixed dollar amount that taxpayers can subtract from their income when determining the amount of their income subject to taxation (e.g., \"taxable income\"). The TCJA nearly doubled the standard deduction. Specifically, in 2018 the standard deduction for unmarried single filers, head of household filers, and married joint filers increased from $6,500, $9,550, and $13,000 to $12,000, $18,000, and $24,000, respectively. The TCJA suspended the personal exemption, effectively reducing it from $4,150 per person in 2018 to $0. These changes are in effect from 2018 through the end of 2025.", "The combination of the standard deduction and personal exemption is sometimes referred to as the 0% bracket since that income is not taxed. It is also referred to as the tax entry point since every dollar above this amount is generally taxable (and hence considered taxable income). The increase of the standard deduction combined with the effective elimination of the personal exemption result in a similar or higher tax entry point for some families (unmarried individuals with no children, unmarried individuals with one child, and married couples with no children, as illustrated in Table C-1 ), while larger families, including many with children, will have a lower tax entry point under the new tax law. For these families, more of their income will potentially be subject to the federal income tax.", "Stylized Example", "For example, as illustrated in Table C-1 , a married couple with two children would have had a tax entry point in 2018 pre-TCJA of $29,600. If this family had $36,000 of income, only the amount above $29,600\u00e2\u0080\u0094$6,400\u00e2\u0080\u0094would have been taxable. Post-TCJA this tax entry point is now $24,000 for this same family. Hence, of their $36,000 of income, $12,000 would now be taxable income.", "Marginal Tax Rates/Tax Brackets", "A marginal tax rate is the percentage that a taxpayer pays on an additional dollar of taxable income. The federal individual income tax code has seven marginal tax rates ranging from 10% to 37%. The income ranges over which these marginal rates apply, often referred to as tax brackets , differ based on the taxpayer's filing status. The federal income tax is considered a progressive tax by economists because as taxable income increases, income above a given bracket threshold is taxed at a higher marginal rate. ", "Once a tax unit has determined how much\u00e2\u0080\u0094if any\u00e2\u0080\u0094of their income is taxable (i.e., after subtracting the standard deduction from their income post-TCJA), they then apply marginal tax rates to this amount. If poor families have any taxable income, most if not all of it is subject to the lowest marginal tax rate, although some of their income may be subject to the second-lowest bracket (the second-lowest bracket was the 15% bracket pre-TCJA, and is now 12% under the TCJA). The lowest marginal tax rate\u00e2\u0080\u009410%\u00e2\u0080\u0094was unchanged by the TCJA. Changes to marginal tax rates are presented in Table C-2 .

Post-TCJA, this same family would have had $12,000 of taxable income, all subject to the 10% marginal rate, which would result in $1,200 of income tax liability before subtracting any tax credits.", "The Child Tax Credit", "After taxpayers calculate their income tax liability before credits, they can subtract the value of any tax credits for which they may be eligible.

The ACTC is calculated as a percentage of earnings (the refundability rate) above the refundability threshold up to the maximum amount of the refundable portion of the credit. The ACTC plus the amount of the credit that offsets any income tax liability cannot be greater than the maximum credit per child. (Low-income families who do have a positive tax liability will first reduce their income tax liability by the nonrefundable portion of the child tax credit, and then claim the ACTC.) TCJA made several changes to the child tax credit and ACTC, as outlined in Table C-3 .", "In addition to modifying the credit formula, TCJA also enacted a new ID requirement for the credit. Prior to TCJA, taxpayers could provide the taxpayer identification number for the child in order to claim the credit. The most common taxpayer ID is a Social Security number (SSN), but other taxpayer identification IDs included individual taxpayer identification numbers (ITINs). Post-TCJA, taxpayers will now need to provide the SSN for the child in order to claim the credit. These changes are in effect from 2018 through the end of 2025. ", "How much a taxpayer's child tax credit changed following the TCJA depends on their income level. As a result of the changes made in the TCJA, the child tax credit doubled for many middle-income families. With the higher income phaseout thresholds, middle- and higher-income families became child tax credit eligible, as illustrated in Figure C-1 . However, many low-income families received a smaller increase, as illustrated in Figure C-2 .", "Stylized Example", "For example, for a married couple with two children and $25,000 of income, their child credit as a result of the TCJA would increase from $2,000 to $2,900 ($800 of the increase from the refundable portion and $100 from the nonrefundable portion).

In 2018, the differences in the EITC from the adoption of this new measure will be relatively small, reducing the maximum amount of the credit by $1 for recipients with no children, $7 for recipients with one child, $12 for those with two children, and $13 for those with three or more children. However, as the effects of the slower inflation adjustment compound over time, these changes will grow larger. ", "In addition, the income cutoff points of marginal tax rates will grow more slowly.
