Mexico's pursuit of FTAs with other countries not only provides economic benefits, but could also potentially reduce its economic dependence on the United States. The United States is, by far, Mexico's most significant trading partner. Approximately 80% of Mexico's exports go to the United States, and about 47% of Mexico's imports are supplied by the United States. In an effort to increase trade with other countries, Mexico has a total of 11 free trade agreements involving 46 countries. These include agreements with most countries in the Western Hemisphere, including the United States and Canada under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Peru, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. In addition, Mexico has negotiated FTAs outside of the Western Hemisphere and entered into agreements with Israel, Japan, and the European Union.", "Economic motivations are generally the major driving force for the formation of free trade agreements among countries, but there are other reasons countries enter into FTAs, including political and security factors. One of Mexico's primary motivations for its unilateral trade liberalization efforts of the late 1980s and early 1990s was to improve economic conditions in the country, which policymakers hoped would lead to greater investor confidence, attract more foreign investment, and create jobs. Mexico could also have other reasons for entering into FTAs, such as expanding market access and decreasing its reliance on the United States as an export market. The slow progress in multilateral trade negotiations may also contribute to the increasing interest throughout the world in bilateral and regional free trade agreements under the World Trade Organization (WTO). Some countries may see smaller trade arrangements as \"building blocks\" for multilateral agreements.", "Since Mexico began liberalizing trade in the early 1990s, its trade with the world has risen rapidly, with exports increasing more rapidly than imports. Mexico's exports to all countries increased 515% between 1994 and 2016, from $60.8 billion to $373.9 billion. Although the 2009 economic downturn resulted in a decline in exports, the value of Mexican exports recovered in the years that followed. Total imports also increased rapidly, from $79.3 billion in 1994 to $387.1 billion in 2016, an increase of 388%. The trade balance went from a deficit of $18.5 billion in 1994 to surpluses of $7.1 billion and $6.5 billion in 1995 and 1996. Since 1998, Mexico's trade balance has remained a deficit, equaling $13.2 billion in 2016. Mexico's top five exports in 2016 were passenger motor vehicles, motor vehicle parts, motor vehicles for the transport of goods, automatic data processing machines, and electrical apparatus for telephones. Mexico's top five imports were motor vehicle parts, refined petroleum oil products, electronic integrated circuits, electric apparatus for telephones, and automatic data processing machines.", "In the 115th Congress, issues of concern related to the trade and economic relationship with Mexico may involve a possible renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and its effects, Mexico's external trade policy with other countries, Mexico's intentions of moving forward with multilateral or bilateral free trade agreements with Asia-Pacific countries, economic conditions in Mexico and the labor market, and the status of Mexican migration to the United States.

Mexico has actively pursued free trade agreements (FTAs) with other countries to help promote economic growth, but also to reduce its economic dependence on the United States. The United States is, by far, Mexico's most significant trading partner. Over 80% of Mexico's exports are destined for the United States. In an effort to increase trade with other countries, Mexico has entered into 11 free trade agreements with 46 countries. Mexico is a signatory to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a proposed free trade agreement (FTA) signed by 12 Asia-Pacific countries on February 4, 2016, after eight years of negotiation. It would require congressional ratification before it could become effective. On January 30, 2017, the United States gave notice to the other TPP signatories that it does not intend to ratify the agreement, effectively ending the U.S. ratification process and TPP's potential entry into force, unless the Administration changes its position.

This motivation was a major factor in negotiating NAFTA with the United States and Canada. The permanent lowering of trade and investment barriers and predictable trade rules provided by FTAs can improve investor confidence in a country, which helps attract foreign direct investment (FDI). Multinational firms invest in countries to gain access to markets, but they also do it to lower production costs.", "Mexico has other motivations for continuing trade liberalization with other countries, such as expanding market access for its exports and decreasing its reliance on the United States as an export market. By entering into trade agreements with other countries, Mexico is seeking to achieve economies of scale in certain sectors of the economy and to expand its export market. FTAs provide partners with broader market access for their goods and services. Countries can benefit from trade agreements, because producers are able to lower their unit costs by producing larger volumes for regional markets in addition to their own domestic markets. When more units of a good or a service can be produced on a larger scale, companies are able to decrease cost of production.", "Mexico's high dependence on the United States as an export market is a likely motivation for seeking FTAs and other regional trade arrangements with other countries. The slow progress in multilateral negotiations in the WTO may be another likely factor. Some countries see smaller trade arrangements as \"building blocks\" for multilateral agreements. Other motivations could be political. Mexico may be seeking to demonstrate good governance by locking in political and economic reforms through trading partnerships.

Mexico established a policy of import substitution in the 1930s, consisting of a broad, general protection of the entire industrial sector through tight restrictions on foreign investment and by controlling the exchange rate to encourage domestic industrial growth. Mexico also nationalized the oil industry at this time. These protectionist economic policies remained in effect until the country began to experience a series of economic challenges several decades later. ", "In the mid-1980s, Mexico's economy was on the verge of collapse as a result of the 1982 debt crisis in which the Mexican government was unable to meet its foreign debt obligations. Much of the government's efforts in addressing these economic challenges were placed on privatizing state industries and moving toward trade liberalization. Mexico had few options but to open its economy through trade liberalization. In the late 1980s and early into the 1990s, Mexico implemented a series of measures to restructure the economy that included unilateral trade liberalization, replacing import substitution policies with others aimed at attracting foreign investment, lowering trade barriers, and making the country competitive in nonoil exports. In 1986, it acceded to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), assuring further trade liberalization measures that led to closer ties with the United States.", "Mexico and the United States began NAFTA negotiations in the early 1990s. Canada later joined the negotiations, and the three countries signed the agreement on December 17, 1992. Before NAFTA came into force Mexico had already entered into its first agreement for free trade in goods, the Mexico-Chile FTA. NAFTA entered into force with much broader provisions than the Chile FTA, such as trade in services, government procurement, dispute settlement procedures, and intellectual property rights protection. In 1999, the original text of the Mexico-Chile FTA was complemented with broader provisions, similar to those under NAFTA. Mexico's initial motivation in pursuing FTAs with the United States and other countries was to stabilize the Mexican economy, which had experienced many difficulties throughout most of the 1980s with a significant deepening of poverty.

The GSTP was established in 1988 as a framework for the exchange of trade preferences among developing countries to promote trade among developing countries. The agreement provides tariff preferences on merchandise trade among member countries. It is a treaty to which only Group of 77 member countries may enter. The text of the agreement was adopted after a round of negotiations that was concluded in Belgrade in 1988. The agreement, which entered into force on April 19, 1989, was envisaged as being a dynamic instrument which would be expanded in successive stages in additional rounds of negotiations and reviewed periodically. A second round of negotiations was proposed in the early 1990s to expand trade preferences, but negotiations faltered as members failed to ratify the agreement. In June 2004, GSTP participants launched a third round of negotiations. Forty-four countries have acceded to the agreement.", "Mexico is a signatory to the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI), which was established by the Treaty of Montevideo in August 1980 and entered into force on March 18, 1981.

For example, labor costs in China have risen over the past 10 years and are higher in some sectors than those in Mexico. Another advantage that Mexico has in comparison to China is the proximity it has to the United States, which provides more cultural similarities, increased efficiencies in manufacturing operations, lower transportation costs, and greater supply chain efficiencies. Nonetheless, Mexico continues to face strong competition from China and other Asian economies in the manufacturing sector. In 2003, China replaced Mexico as the second-highest source of U.S. imports.

Another issue of interest to U.S. policymakers is the effect of Mexico's FTAs on U.S. exports to Mexico. The liberalization of Mexico's trade and investment barriers to other countries has resulted in increasing competition for U.S. goods and services in the Mexican market. Consequently, the U.S. share of goods imported by Mexico has been falling steadily over the years.
