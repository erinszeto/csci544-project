The School Lunch and School Breakfast programs provide cash subsidies for all meals they serve to schools choosing to participate; largersubsidies are granted for free and reduced-price meals offered to lower-income children. The Child and Adult Care Food program subsidizes meals/snacks served by child care centersand day care homes; federal subsidy rules differ significantly between those provided tocenters and those for day care homes. Schools and organizations operating programs forchildren also can receive subsidies for snacks (and, in some cases, meals) served in after-school and other outside-of-school settings . The Summer Food Service program subsidizes food service operations by public/private nonprofit sponsors volunteering tooperate projects during the summer; all meals/snacks they serve are free. The Special Milkprogram operates in schools and other venues without a lunch program and subsidizes allmilk served. All these subsidies are inflation-indexed and are paid only where themeals/snacks meet federal nutrition and other standards. In addition to cash aid, manyproviders receive food commodities from the Agriculture Department, at a set value per meal(and may receive \"bonus\" commodities from Department surplus stocks). Grants also aremade to help cover state administrative expenses . Other significant federalprograms/activities include a free fresh fruit and vegetable program in selected schools,money for a Food Service Management Institute, a small nutrition education initiative,activities to improve program integrity, meal quality, food service and safety, and support forlocal school \"wellness policies.\" Separately, the WIC program provides nutrition services(e.g., nutrition education, breastfeeding support) and tailored food packages to lower-incomepregnant and postpartum women, infants, and children who are judged to be at nutritionalrisk. And a WIC farmers' market program offers vouchers to WIC recipients for the purchaseof fresh fruit and vegetables at farmers' markets.", "These are administered by the Agriculture Department's Food and Nutrition Serviceand state education, health, social service, and agriculture agencies. They actually areoperated, under state oversight, by over 300,000 local providers (such as schools, child carecenters, health clinics).

Russell National School Lunch in 1999), the Child Nutrition Act (originallyenacted in 1966), and Section 32 of the act of August 24, 1935 (7 U.S.C. 612c). (1) The AgricultureDepartment's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) administers the programs at the federal level;most funding is included in the annual Agriculture Department appropriations laws; andcongressional jurisdiction is exercised by the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and ForestryCommittee, the House Education and the Workforce Committee, and, to a limited extent(relating to commodity assistance and Section 32), the House Agriculture Committee.", "The most recent major amendments to the laws affecting child nutrition and WICprograms were made in the 2004 Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act ( P.L.108-265 ; enacted June 30, 2004) and a number of laws enacted in the 106th and 107thCongresses -- most notably as part of larger measures not specifically targeted at childnutrition or WIC programs (e.g., P.L. 106-224 and P.L. 107-171 ). The next generalreauthorization of child nutrition and WIC authorities is scheduled for 2009.", "Child nutrition and WIC programs are operated by a variety of local public andprivate nonprofit providers, and the degree of direct state involvement varies by program andstate -- e.g., in the WIC program, state health agencies exercise substantial control; in theschool meal programs, local educational agencies (LEAs), and local \"school food authorities\"most often have the major role; in a very few instances, the federal government (FNS) takesthe place of state agencies (for example, where a state has chosen not to operate a specificprogram or where there is a state prohibition on aiding private schools). At the state level,education, health, social services, and agriculture departments all have roles; at a minimum,they are responsible for approving and overseeing local providers such as schools, summerprogram sponsors, and child care centers, as well as making sure they receive the federalsupport they are due. At the local level, program benefits are provided to more than 39million children and infants, and some 2 million lower-income pregnant and postpartumwomen, through just over 100,000 public and private schools and residential child careinstitutions, about 200,000 child care centers and family day care homes, approximately30,000 summer program sites, and, in the case of the WIC program, some 10,000 local healthcare clinics/sites operated by nearly 2,000 health agencies.", "All programs are available in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Virtually alloperate in Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands, and there are no restrictions oneligibility related to citizenship or legal residence status. American Samoa gets assistancefor school lunch and WIC operations, and the Northern Marianas receive school lunchsupport. In addition, WIC-like benefits are available for overseas military personnel, andDefense Department overseas dependents' schools participate in the School Lunch andBreakfast programs.", "In the meal service programs like the School Lunch and School Breakfast programs,summer programs, and assistance for child care centers and day care homes, federal aid is inthe form of legislatively set subsidies paid for each meal/snack served that meets federalnutrition guidelines. Most subsidies are cash payments to schools and other providers, butabout 10% of the total value of assistance is in the form of federally donated foodcommodities. While all meals/snacks served are subsidized, those served free or at a reducedprice to lower-income children are supported at higher rates. All federal meal/snack subsidyrates are indexed annually for inflation, (2) as are the income standards of eligibility for free andreduced-price meals/snacks. (3) However, federal subsidies do not necessarily cover the fullcost of the meals and snacks offered by participating providers, and states and localitiescontribute significantly to cover program costs -- as do children's families (by paying chargesfor nonfree or reduced-price meals and snacks). Required nonfederal cost-sharing (matching)is relatively minimal -- states must expend at least an amount totaling just over $200 milliona year nationally in order to receive federal school lunch funds. Federal per-meal/snack childnutrition subsidies may cover local providers' administrative costs, but separate federalpayments for administrative expenses are limited to administrative expense grants to stateoversight agencies, a small set-aside of funds for state audits of child care sponsors, andspecial administrative payments to sponsors of summer programs and family day care homes. Under the WIC program, federal appropriations pay the cost of specifically tailored foodpackages and include specific amounts for related nutrition services and administration.", "The basic goals of the federal child nutrition programs are to improve children'snutrition, increase lower-income children's access to nutritious meals and snacks, and helpsupport the agricultural economy. Child nutrition programs are treated as entitlements: federal funding and commodity support is \"guaranteed\" to schools and other providers basedon the number of meals/snacks/half-pints of milk served, who is served (e.g., freemeals/snacks to poor children get higher subsidies), and legislatively set andinflation-indexed per-meal/snack subsidy rates. On the other hand, the WIC program is a discretionary grant program. WIC agencies serve as many applicants as possible with themoney available from federal grants (and, in some cases, voluntary state subsidies), but notnecessarily all eligible applicants.", "Extensive information about child nutrition programs and the WIC program may befound at the Agriculture Department's Food and Nutrition Service website: http://www.fns.usda.gov .

In addition, participating centers receive commodity assistance (seethe later discussion of commodity distribution) or cash-in-lieu of commodities; thisrepresents about 4% of the value of aid they get.", "Inflation-indexed federal cash subsidies to centers vary by the type of mealserved (breakfast, lunch/supper, snack). Similar to the school meal programs, thesesubsidies vary by whether they are served to (1) children with family income below130% of the federal poverty income guidelines (for those who would be eligible fora free school meal, see the School Lunch program discussion), (2) children withfamily income between 130% and 185% of the poverty guidelines (those who wouldbe eligible for a reduced-price school meal, see the School Lunch programdiscussion), or (3) children with family income above 185% of the poverty guidelines(those who would not be eligible for either a free or reduced-price school meal).

For July 2006-June 2007, the subsidies forsnacks are 65 cents for \"free\" snacks, 32 cents for \"reduced-price\" snacks, and 6 centsfor all other snacks. However, unlike the school meal programs, while federal cashsubsidies differ according to the family income of individual children in a center,there is no requirement that free or reduced-price meals be served. Centers mayadjust their fees to account for the federal subsidies or charge (or not charge)separately for meals to account for the subsidies; but the CACFP itself does notregulate the fees they charge.", "The CACFP generally operates through child care centers that are public orprivate nonprofit entities. However, for-profit child care centers can participate in theCACFP if they meet certain conditions. They are qualified if they receive at leastsome payments derived from Title XX of the Social Security Act (the federal SocialServices Block Grant) for at least 25% of enrolled children. (13) In addition,under a pilot project that began operating in Iowa and Kentucky, a more liberal testcan be applied to for-profit centers: they may participate if at least 25% of enrolledchildren meet the family income requirements for free/reduced-price school meals;this pilot was expanded to Delaware in FY2002. Finally, under provisions of lawenacted in December 2000 ( P.L. 106-554 ), the more liberal Iowa/Kentucky/Delawarerule was made applicable nationwide . The nationwide authority granted in theDecember 2000 law originally covered FY2001 only.

(14) As a result,there now are three potential methods by which for-profit centers can qualify: theoriginal Title XX rule, the \"pooling\" variation of that rule (see footnote 13), and, mostimportant, the (now permanent and nationwide) Iowa/Kentucky/Delaware rule.", "In addition to the regular CACFP, the law allows organizations that wouldnormally be eligible to participate in the regular CACFP as child care centers(including schools), and running after-school programs (or other similar programsoperated outside regular school schedules) serving an \"educational enrichmentpurpose,\" to get federal CACFP subsidies for snacks served free in their programs tochildren ( through age 18 ) in lower-income areas -- at the free snack rate notedabove. (15) Moreover, in seven states -- Delaware, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania,New York, and Oregon -- the law allows federal subsidies to be offered for free meals, typically suppers, served in after-school programs (at the free lunch rate, $2.40a supper).", "Separately, the CACFP provides cash subsidies to family and group day carehomes , typically serving four to six children. This component operates verydifferently than the component for centers, although, like centers, subsidies for daycare homes are limited to two meals and one snack (or one meal and two snacks) perday per child. ", "Day care homes receive cash subsidies that generally do not differ byindividual children's family income -- unlike the subsidy structure in programs forschools and child care centers, which differs according to the family income of thechild to whom the meal/snack is served. (16) Instead, there are two distinct sets of subsidy ratesthat generally depend on the location of the home or the provider's income. \"Tier I\"homes -- those located in lower-income areas or operated by lower-income providers -- receive higher cash subsidies; for July 2006-June 2007, all lunches/suppers aresubsidized at $1.97 each, all breakfasts are subsidized at $1.06, and all snacks aresubsidized at 58 cents. The majority of participating homes are in Tier I. On theother hand, \"Tier II\" homes -- those not located in lower-income areas or without alower-income provider -- receive much lower subsidies; for July 2006-June 2007, alllunches/suppers are subsidized at $1.19 each, all breakfasts at 39 cents, and all snacksat 16 cents. Tier II homes may seek the higher Tier I rates for individuallower-income children, and, similar to the program in centers, day care homesponsors may opt to have subsidies calculated according to the family incomedemographics of the children in the homes they sponsor -- if family incomedocumentation is obtained. (17) ", "Day care homes participate under the aegis of public or private nonprofit\"sponsoring organizations\" that handle administrative tasks (e.g., overseeingcompliance with program requirements, making federal subsidy claims). Thesesponsors receive separate inflation-indexed monthly payments for theiradministrative/oversight costs, varying according to the number of homes the sponsoroversees; for July 2006-June 2007, these per-home payments ranged from $50 to $95a month. Centers may participate either directly as independent centers or through asponsoring organization; but center sponsors do not receive additional federaladministrative funds (although sponsors can assess centers for administration to alimited degree).

(24) The WICprogram originated as a two-year pilot project in 1972, and was established in law asa national program in 1975.", "Although the administering state and tribal WIC agencies have somediscretion in judging eligibility, recipients' household income generally can be nohigher than 185% of the federal poverty guidelines (the same standard used fordetermining eligibility for reduced-price school meals) -- e.g., $24,440 for a familyof two or $30,710 for a three-person family, until the next annual inflation adjustmentin July 2007 -- and all state agencies now use the 185% income test. In thealternative, applicants who are recipients of Medicaid, food stamp, or TemporaryAssistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefits may be judged automaticallyincome-eligible. However, just as important as meeting the income test, enrolleesalso must be judged at \"nutritional risk\" by health professionals in the health agenciesand clinics that administer the program -- e.g., based on clinical measurements,documented nutritionally related medical conditions, dietary deficiencies.", "Foods are provided (\"prescribed\") through vouchers/checks, listing thespecific foods and amounts appropriate to the recipient's status, that are redeemed atapproved retail outlets (or, much less commonly, supplied directly by theadministering agency itself). (25) The specific foods prescribed (e.g., juice, infantformula, cereal, eggs) are based on a set of federally established food packages thatdiffer by recipient type (e.g., infant, pregnant mother). However, WIC agencies haveconsiderable leeway in implementing the federally defined food packages. Theychoose which infant formulas (or other items like juices or cereals) are offered to meetthe federal food package requirements and how to respond to recipients' special needs. ", "Participating retailers (more than 45,000 are approved) then redeem thevouchers/checks for cash through arrangements with their state WIC agency. Theprogram also provides financial support for state and local clinic Nutrition Servicesand Administrative (NSA) costs -- about 27% of total federal aid provided to statesand tribal organizations. These include costs associated with nutritional risk, health,and immunization assessments, nutrition and substance abuse education andcounseling, health care and immunization referrals, certain breastfeeding promotionand support costs, determining eligibility, and issuing and redeeming vouchers (ordirectly delivering food items or operating an EBT system). (26) In addition,about 1% of WIC spending goes for grants to improve infrastructure (e.g., computersystems), technical assistance, and special projects like breastfeeding peer counselorsand help with state management information systems.", "Annual federal appropriations are granted to state and Indian tribal WICagencies under a formula that reflects food and NSA caseload costs, inflation, and\"need\" (as evidenced by poverty indices) -- although small amounts are set aside anddistributed at the Agriculture Department's discretion for infrastructure development(like building and upgrading EBT and management information systems) and other(e.g., breastfeeding counselor) projects, and other funds have been used for smallspecial initiatives (e.g., immunization and health care outreach efforts). These annualnew appropriations are supplemented by unused money carried over from year to yearand reallocated among state and tribal grantees or retained by state WIC agencies foruse in the next year. Moreover, recent appropriations also have included a small ($125million) contingency fund.", "The direct support supplied by appropriations and funding carryovers is addedto by the effect (holding down food costs) of substantial rebates (discounts) frommanufacturers with which state agencies contract (through competitive bidding) to bethe sole source for a particular food item. This cost control strategy is used by allstate agencies for infant formula, and, in FY2005, the majority of them received 90%-97% discounts on the wholesale cost of infant formula. (27) Moreover,11 state agencies also have rebate contracts for juice and cereal. In FY2005, theestimated rebate savings was worth $1.6 billion. (28) As part ofthis cost containment effort, special limits are in place for approving retailers whoderive the majority of their revenue from WIC vouchers (so-called \"WIC-only\"stores); at present, no new WIC-only stores may be certified for participation, and theprices they may charge the WIC program are significantly constricted.", "Finally, a relatively small (in dollar terms) WIC farmers' market nutritionprogram operates, with significant non-federal matching funding (30% ofadministrative costs), in 38 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, andfour Indian tribal organizations. It is run by a variety of state agencies (typically, stateagriculture offices) coordinating with the regular WIC program and offers some 2.5million WIC participants special vouchers that are used to buy fresh produce throughabout 4,700 participating farmers' markets, roadside stands, and community supportedagriculture projects. The federal government pays the cost of the first $30 (perparticipant per year) of each farmers' market voucher, and shares administrative costswith the states and other political jurisdictions sponsoring the program.", "In FY2005, average monthly WIC participation was 8.0 million persons --1.97 million women, 2.05 million infants, and 4.0 million children.
