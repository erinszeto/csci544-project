For instance, interconnectivity and technological innovation have not only fostered international business and communication, they have also helped criminals carry out their operations. At times, these same technological advances have presented unique hurdles for law enforcement and officials charged with combating malicious actors.", "Technology as a barrier for law enforcement is by no means a new issue in U.S. policing. In the 1990s, for instance, there were concerns about digital and wireless communications potentially hampering law enforcement in carrying out court-authorized surveillance. To help combat these challenges, Congress passed the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA; P.L. 103-414), which, among other things, required telecommunications carriers to assist law enforcement in executing authorized electronic surveillance.", "The technology boundary has received renewed attention as companies have implemented advanced security for their products\u2014particularly their mobile devices. In some cases, enhanced encryption measures have been put in place resulting in the fact that companies such as Apple and Google cannot unlock devices for anyone under any circumstances, not even law enforcement.", "Law enforcement has concerns over certain technological changes, and there are fears that officials may be unable to keep pace with technological advances and conduct electronic surveillance if they cannot access certain information. Originally, the going dark debate centered on law enforcement's ability to intercept real-time communications. More recent technology changes have potentially impacted law enforcement capabilities to access not only communications, but stored data as well.", "There are concerns that enhanced encryption may affect law enforcement investigations. For instance, following the December 2, 2015, terrorist attack in San Bernardino, CA, investigators recovered a cell phone belonging to one of the suspected shooters. FBI Director Comey testified before Congress two months later and indicated that the bureau was still unable to unlock the device. On February 16, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California ordered Apple to provide \"reasonable technical assistance to assist law enforcement agents in obtaining access to the data\" on the cell phone. The outcome of this case may have implications for how law enforcement and policymakers respond to the broader conversation on enhanced encryption.", "If evidence arises that investigations are hampered, policymakers may question what, if any, actions they should take. One option is that Congress could update electronic surveillance laws to cover data stored on smartphones. Congress could also prohibit the encryption of data unless law enforcement could still access the encrypted data. They may also consider enhancing law enforcement's financial resources and manpower, which could involve enhancing training for existing officers or hiring more personnel with strong technology expertise.", "Some of these options may involve the application of a \"back door\" or \"golden key\" that can allow for access to smartphones. However, as has been noted, \"when you build a back door ... for the good guys, you can be assured that the bad guys will figure out how to use it as well.\" This is often maintained to be an inevitable tradeoff. Policymakers may debate which\u2014if either\u2014may be more advantageous for the nation on the whole: increased security coupled with potentially fewer data breaches and possibly greater impediments to law enforcement investigations, or increased access to data paired with potentially greater vulnerability to malicious actors."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["F ast-changing technology creates a challenging environment for crime-fighting.

On the other, it has opened the doors for potential exploitation by a range of malicious actors.", "Just as the growth of technology offers advances and challenges, so does its security. The stronger the security features of our technology, the less vulnerable the technology may be. However, if the security is sufficiently strong, the technology and its associated information may become inaccessible to legitimate law enforcement investigations. This is one aspect of the current debate surrounding smartphone and other mobile technology and security.", "Smartphone ownership is on the rise, with 64% of adult Americans owning a smartphone as of October 2014. Smartphones have become valuable targets for hackers because, in part, of the breadth of personal information they contain. Because of this, manufacturers regularly update their devices' security features, and experts have encouraged consumers to take advantage of these features\u2014such as locking smartphones with a passcode and encrypting the contents. One current concern is that such strong security measures could not only keep out potential malicious actors, but legitimate individuals as well, including users who forget their passcodes or law enforcement with a lawful search warrant.", "This report provides an overview of the perennial issue involving technology outpacing law enforcement and discusses how policymakers and law enforcement officials have dealt with this issue in the past.

There are several notable caveats to this requirement, however:", "Law enforcement and officials are not authorized to require telecommunications providers (as well as manufacturers of equipment and providers of support services) to adopt \"specific design of equipment, facilities, services, features, or system configurations.\" Similarly, officials may not prohibit \"the adoption of any equipment, facility, service, or feature\" by these entities. Telecommunications carriers are not responsible for \"decrypting, or ensuring the government's ability to decrypt, any communication encrypted by a subscriber or customer, unless the encryption was provided by the carrier and the carrier possesses the information necessary to decrypt the communication.\"", "A decade after the passage of CALEA, federal law enforcement officials were again concerned that their ability to conduct electronic surveillance was constrained because of constantly emerging technologies. Not all telecommunications providers had implemented CALEA-compliant intercept capabilities. As such, the Department of Justice (DOJ), FBI, and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) filed a Joint Petition for Expedited Rulemaking asking the Federal Communications Commission to extend CALEA provisions to a wider breadth of telecommunications providers. Subsequently, the FCC administratively expanded CALEA's requirements to apply to both broadband and VoIP providers.", "Notably, CALEA is not viewed as applying to email or data while stored on smartphones and similar mobile devices.

When PGP was released, it \"was a milestone in the development of public cryptography. For the first time, military-grade cryptography was available to the public, a level of security so high that even the ultra-secret code-breaking computers at the National Security Agency could not decipher the encrypted messages.\" When someone released a copy of PGP on the Internet, it proliferated, sparking a federal investigation into whether Zimmerman was illegally exporting cryptographic software (then considered a form of \"munitions\" under the U.S. export regulations) without a specific munitions export license.

Where these data are stored varies based on factors such as default smartphone settings, users' personalized settings, and telecommunications providers' policies. ", "When law enforcement accesses, or attempts to access, this information, it is often gathered through authorized wiretaps or search warrants. Its not always clear, however, exactly how often law enforcement gathers or relies upon these data in their investigations. Data exist on the number of wiretap requests and intercept orders that are issued in investigations of felonies as well as on how often law enforcement encounters encryption in carrying out these orders. These data provide a snapshot of law enforcement use of wiretaps and possible encryption barriers. ", "In 2014, judges authorized 3,554 wiretaps, of which about 36% (1,279 orders) were under federal jurisdiction. Notably, 96% (3,409) of total authorized intercept orders were for portable devices. From the 1,279 federally authorized intercept orders, they produced an average of 5,724 intercepts, including an average of 886 \"incriminating intercepts.\"", "In 2001, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts began collecting data on whether law enforcement encountered encryption in the course of carrying out wiretaps as well as whether officials were able to overcome the encryption and decipher the \"plain text\" of the encrypted information. Law enforcement has reported encountering encryption in at least one instance each year, with the exception of 2006 and 2007.

See Figure 1 for an illustration of the 2014 data.", "As noted, law enforcement has reported encountering encryption nearly every year since 2001, though law enforcement has only encountered encryption it could not circumvent since 2011. The number of instances in which this has occurred, however, has fluctuated and has been relatively low, such that analysts cannot make claims as to whether or not this number is on a specific trajectory.

Opponents to CALEA expansion proposals, however, may contend that mandating other communications services and technology manufacturers to build in intercept capabilities could be costly, both financially and in terms of security. Financially, companies may need to dedicate resources to reengineer their products; they may need to add or allocate personnel to liaise with law enforcement to facilitate wiretap requests.
