Mexico is a top trade partner and the third-largest crude oil supplier to the United States. Mexico's state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) remains an important source of government revenue even as it is struggling to counter declining oil production and reserves. Due to an inability to meet rising demand, Mexico has also significantly increased natural gas imports from the United States. Still, gas shortages have hindered the country's economic performance.", "On December 20, 2013, Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto signed historic constitutional reforms related to Mexico's energy sector aimed at reversing oil and gas production declines. On August 11, 2014, secondary laws to implement those reforms officially opened Mexico's oil, natural gas, and power sectors to private investment. As a result, Pemex can now partner with international companies that have the experience and capital required for exploring Mexico's vast deep water and shale resources. Leftist parties and others remain opposed to the reforms.", "The energy reforms transform Pemex into a \"productive state enterprise\" with more autonomy and a lower tax burden than before, but make it subject to competition with private investors. They create different types of contracts for private companies interested in investing in Mexico, including production-sharing and licensing; allow companies to post reserves for accounting purposes; establish a sovereign wealth fund; and create new regulators. In December 2014, the Mexican government announced the terms of part one of Round 1, under which shallow-water offshore exploratory blocks available for public bidding would be auctioned. On July 15, 2015, Mexico's Energy Ministry announced that only 2 of the 14 blocks available were awarded to successful bidders. The government has altered the terms of the second round of bidding on September 30, including lowering the amount of upfront investment required by companies to bid and increasing the size of the blocks available, in order to attract more interest.", "The U.S. Congress has legislative and oversight interests in examining the implications of Mexico's oil and natural gas reforms on U.S. hydrocarbon imports and exports, bilateral trade and investment, and economic conditions in Mexico. In December 2013, Congress approved the U.S.-Mexico Transboundary Hydrocarbons Agreement (P.L. 113-67), which aims to facilitate joint development of oil and natural gas in part of the Gulf of Mexico. The 114th Congress is likely to consider legislative proposals to speed up energy infrastructure development, including cross-border natural gas pipelines, as was approved by the House on January 21, 2015 (H.R. 161). Congress may also consider proposals to revise U.S. crude oil export policy. See also CRS Report R43442, U.S. Crude Oil Export Policy: Background and Considerations, by [author name scrubbed] et al.", "The opening of Mexico's oil and natural gas sector could expand U.S.-Mexico energy trade and provide opportunities for U.S. companies involved in the hydrocarbons sector, as well as infrastructure and other oil field services. If these reforms accelerate growth and investment in Mexico (as the government has stated), they could also benefit North American competitiveness. Industry analysts maintain that the reforms are generally well-designed, but that the way they are implemented will likely determine their impact. The success of the reforms may also depend on trends in global oil prices. Should oil prices remain at current levels, shale resources and other unconventional fields may not be feasible to develop at this time."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The United States has a strong economic interest in ensuring energy security, bolstering exports, and reducing barriers to U.S. trade and investment.

U.S.-Mexico energy trade and cooperation plays an important role in achieving those goals. Energy cooperation has become a priority of bilateral economic cooperation under the U.S.-Mexico High Level Economic Dialogue as well as a focus of trilateral research, planning, and coordination among the energy secretaries of the United States, Canada, and Mexico.", "U.S. policymakers are closely monitoring the implementation of the December 2013 constitutional reforms and August 2014 implementing laws that, among other things, allow Mexico's Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) to partner with international companies and other industry entrants to boost Mexican production. Hailed by many analysts as the most significant economic reform undertaken by Mexico since its entrance into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994, the energy reforms are expected to boost investment, growth, and eventually oil and gas production in the country. The reforms also opened Mexico's electricity sector to private generators, although that is not addressed in this report. If power sector reforms can help reduce Mexico's high electricity costs, then Mexico's manufacturing sector\u2014a dynamic sector that is highly integrated with U.S. industry\u2014should become more competitive.", "There is a danger, however, that the Mexican government may have oversold the benefits of the reforms. Investors initially appeared to have maintained interest in Mexico's energy sector despite declines in oil prices, but the results of Mexico's first round of public bidding announced in July 2015 proved disappointing. At a House hearing held on July 23, 2015, witnesses cited the limited size and production potential of the blocks offered, the high minimum bid required, and investors' concerns about corruption and insecurity as possible reasons for the lack of interest in the tender. Mexico has sought to assuage those concerns prior to the September 30 bidding round that will include nine large shallow-water production blocks.", "This report provides an overview of Pemex and the content and prospects for Mexico's energy reforms, before discussing specific issues facing Mexico's oil and gas industry. It then examines the U.S.-Mexico energy relationship through the lenses of trade and energy cooperation.

After oil was discovered in Mexico at the turn of the 20 th century, foreign investors\u2014primarily from Britain and the United States\u2014played a significant role in helping the country become the world's second-largest oil producer by the early 1920s. However, political unrest during and after Mexico's bloody revolution (1910-1920) and the country's 1917 constitution, which established national ownership of all hydrocarbons resources, caused investment in Mexico's oil and natural gas sectors to gradually decline. By the 1930s, reduced foreign investment had resulted in dramatic declines in production levels, and fraught relations between U.S. oil companies and successive post-revolutionary presidents had damaged U.S.-Mexican relations. Tensions culminated in President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas' historic 1938 decision to abandon efforts to mediate a bitter labor dispute between Mexican oil workers and foreign companies and instead follow through on his threat to expropriate all U.S. and other foreign oil assets in Mexico.

Oil remains deeply tied to Mexican nationalism. Nevertheless, Pemex continued to pursue service contracts with some U.S. oil companies until the practice was definitively outlawed by a 1958 regulatory law implementing Article 27 of the constitution. From then on, Pemex retained a monopoly over Mexico's oil and natural gas sector and the Mexican Finance Ministry kept tight control over the company's finances and management.", "In 2013, 75 years after its founding, Pemex found itself facing significant challenges. Pemex had its heyday in the late 1970s following the discovery of the huge shallow water Cantarell oil field, but the company's long-term performance had been hindered by a number of factors. For years, Pemex sustained itself on the revenue produced from its relatively easy-to-exploit shallow water fields without investing the capital necessary to replace those reserves with new fields or even maintain its infrastructure. Pemex had a high percentage of losses, low worker productivity, and facilities that are in significant need of repair; 37 people were killed in January 2013 after an explosion occurred at one of the company's offices in Mexico City. In part because of the Mexican government's heavy tax demands, Pemex had operated at a loss since 1998 and significantly increased its debt burden. Until recently, the government had also prevented the company from reinvesting its profits into maintenance and new exploration. Pemex's pension liabilities, negotiated by the company's powerful and, for some observers, corrupt workers union, had become an unsustainable drain on its finances. Each year, Pemex had been losing hundreds of millions of dollars due to criminal groups illegally tapping into its pipelines. Pemex's inability to partner with other companies arguably inhibited it from benefitting from new expertise and techniques, particularly in deep water drilling and hydraulic fracturing (fracking)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Path to Pemex Reform", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Proposals for Energy Reform", "paragraphs": ["President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of the nationalistic PRI assumed the Mexican presidency on December 1, 2012, after 12 years of rule by the conservative National Action Party (PAN).

Production has also begun to decline in recent years as price differentials have made it more profitable for Pemex to produce oil than gas. And, although Mexico may have significant unconventional natural gas resources, it is further behind in developing these resources than other countries, such as Canada.

As part of that effort, since 2011 the North American Development Bank has provided loans worth at least $677 million for projects related to wind and solar energy. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and Mexico have also expanded cooperation on environmental issues with the Mexico Global Climate Change (GCC) Program , a five-year, approximately $70 million program. The program seeks to help Mexico reduce emissions from deforestation, implement a low emissions development plan, and create a system for monitoring greenhouse gas emissions. ", "Although Mexico is trying to diversify its energy sources, it, like the United States, is likely to continue relying on oil and natural gas from traditional and unconventional (i.e., shale) sources. In the wake of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico and amid concerns about the impact of hydraulic fracturing of shale oil in the United States, both governments have an interest in ensuring that hydrocarbons resources are developed in an environmentally responsible way. For example, as Pemex begins to partner with U.S. companies in the Gulf, it could benefit from participation in the Marine Well Containment Company that was created by U.S. companies to deal with spills. Should Pemex pursue contracts with U.S. companies who have years of expertise in hydraulic fracturing, they could complement the environmental and regulatory advice that Mexico is already receiving from the U.S. Departments of State and the Interior."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "United States-Mexico Trans-Boundary Hydrocarbons Agreement", "paragraphs": ["In 2012, the United States and Mexico signed an agreement known as the U.S.-Mexico Transboundary Hydrocarbons Agreement (the Agreement). The Agreement could mark the start of an energy partnership in an area of the Gulf of Mexico that the U.S. Department of the Interior estimates to contain as much as 172 million barrels of oil and 304 billion cubic feet of natural gas. Although it concerns relatively little oil and natural gas, a main purpose of the partnership is to lift a moratorium on development in that region that had been in effect since 2000. In addition, the Agreement gives Pemex and U.S. companies options for jointly developing oil and gas reservoirs, referred to as \"transboundary resources,\" that exist in areas straddling the marine border of both countries.

Economic growth in Mexico has been sluggish for several years, expanding just 2.4% in 2014 and 1.4% in 2013. Growth is forecast to drop slightly in 2015 to 2.1%. Since the Mexican government's reliance on oil income is very high, any decline in oil revenue has fiscal and economic implications. The decline in oil production combined with the drop in oil prices has resulted in lower export earnings, prompting foreign-exchange market volatility and causing the peso to depreciate. Energy reform is the centerpiece of the President Pe\u00f1a Nieto administration's attempts to overhaul the economy, attract greater foreign investment, and generate more jobs. Numerous observers and government officials have laid out high expectations for the potential of Mexico's energy reforms to improve economic conditions. One study suggests that the reform \"offers the prospect of enormous wealth generation over the next five years.\" ", "According to some industry experts, the importance of energy reform in Mexico cannot be understated because of the additional opportunities for unconventional or shale oil and gas production. While it is difficult to predict how increasing private participation in Mexico's oil and gas sectors may affect the country's economic development, skeptics see reason to doubt the government's positive predictions. Some argue that multinational companies and large Mexican conglomerates stand more to gain from the energy reform than the Mexican people. Other critics question the government's claim that the reforms will create thousands of jobs, and, maintain that because Pemex is a bloated company with too many employees, it would likely shed workers as a result of the reform. Others are concerned that the oil revenue will be mishandled by corrupt Pemex or government officials rather than invested in strategic ways that will benefit the country as a whole."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impact on the U.S. Oil and Natural Gas Sectors and the Bilateral Energy Trade", "paragraphs": ["The opening of Mexico's oil and natural gas sector to foreign investors poses significant changes in the U.S.-Mexico energy relationship that may have advantages and disadvantages for both sides. Reversing Mexico's production decline would add more oil to the global market and enhance U.S. energy security. Having a neighbor who is a growing oil producer to the south, as the United States has to the north with Canada, could provide a reliable supplier for the long term and it would also contribute to North American energy independence. Some predict that the region could produce surpluses of oil and gas in the coming decades, as well as expanded renewable energy: wind, solar, biofuels, and hydro-power. ", "U.S. companies that are able to enter the Mexican upstream sector are likely to benefit from the opening of Mexican resources to foreign investment, depending upon the terms of the contracts that are offered. Significant opportunities for infrastructure development, oil services companies, and downstream industries are also likely to open up.

There are certain cases where crude oil exports are permitted in statute, including if it is shipped to Canada for use therein, is shipped on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, is of foreign origin, or is from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve if such export will directly result in import of refined products not otherwise available. Additionally, crude oil export regulations allow for exchanges with adjacent and non-adjacent countries as long as certain criteria are met. EPCA and other statutes permit crude oil exports in circumstances where the President determines that such exports are in the national interest.

Under current laws and regulations, unlimited oil exports from the United States to Canada are allowed, although an application must be approved for each export transaction. As a result of this exemption, Canada is the primary destination for U.S. crude oil exports, with exports exceeding 570,000 bbl/d in May 2015. The President could make a similar national interest determination for export to Mexico, and, arguably, such a determination would allow crude oil to be traded freely between the countries as economic conditions justified.", "Congressional debate about potential changes to crude oil export restrictions is ongoing. Numerous economic studies from various government and industry organizations have been published. During the 114 th Congress, there have been numerous hearings held by various House and Senate committees that have explored aspects of U.S. crude oil export policy. Furthermore, at least seven bills have been proposed during the 114 th Congress, in addition to various Senate amendments that have been filed. As of the date of this report, bills have been advanced in the energy committees of both the House and Senate that would allow for unrestricted crude oil exports.

It is important to recognize that exchanges with adjacent and non-adjacent foreign states are distinct types of crude oil export transactions, and each has different criteria. Generally, crude oil export licenses for non-adjacent foreign state exchanges are much more difficult to obtain than those for adjacent foreign states. Adjacent foreign state exchanges could be approved based on \"convenience and increased efficiency of transportation,\" terms that are not defined in the regulations. Crude oil exported as part of an adjacent foreign state transaction may not be reexported to another country.", "In a move that could potentially enhance the efficiency of refinery utilization in both the United States and Mexico, the Mexican government proposed an exchange transaction whereby heavy, sour crude oil from Mexico would be exchanged for light, sweet crude oil from the United States. On January 8, 2015, the chief executive officer of Pemex announced that the company wants to increase Mexico's production of gasoline for domestic use by importing and refining light crude from the United States. U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker has confirmed that the United States is engaged in ongoing discussions with Mexican officials over whether to export light crude oil to Mexico. In August 2015, the Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security stated that it \"is acting favorably on license applications for the exchange of U.S. crude oil for similar quantities of Mexican crude oil.\" Details of the approved applications were not disclosed.

Another area that could be expanded involves efforts to ensure that hydrocarbons resources are developed without unduly damaging the environment, possibly through collaboration between Mexican entities and U.S. federal or state regulatory entities. In terms of capacity-building, the University of Texas system has recently expanded educational exchanges and training opportunities for Mexicans working in the petroleum sector. Other U.S. universities could also follow suit, potentially with support from the Obama Administration's \"100,000 Strong in the Americas\" effort to boost educational exchanges.
