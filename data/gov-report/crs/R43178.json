According to the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC's) National Broadband Plan, the lack of adequate broadband availability is most pressing in rural America, where the costs of serving large geographical areas, coupled with low population densities, often reduce economic incentives for telecommunications providers to invest in and maintain broadband infrastructure and service. The National Broadband Plan also identified broadband adoption as a problem, whereby one in three Americans have broadband available but choose not to subscribe. Populations continuing to lag behind in broadband adoption include people with low incomes, seniors, minorities, the less-educated, non-family households, and the non-employed.

Some policymakers contend that more specific regulatory guidelines may be necessary to protect the marketplace from potential abuses which could threaten the net neutrality concept. Others contend that existing laws and policies are sufficient to deal with potential anti-competitive behavior and that additional regulations would have negative effects on the expansion and future development of the Internet.", "What, if any, action should be taken to ensure \"net neutrality\" has become a major focal point in the debate over broadband regulation. As the marketplace for broadband continues to evolve, some contend that no new regulations are needed, and if enacted will slow deployment of and access to the Internet, as well as limit innovation. Others, however, contend that the consolidation of broadband providers, coupled with their diversification into content, has the potential to lead to discriminatory behaviors which conflict with net neutrality principles. The two potential behaviors most often cited are the network providers' ability to control access to and the pricing of broadband facilities, and the incentive to favor network-owned content, thereby placing unaffiliated content providers at a competitive disadvantage.", "The December 21, 2010, adoption, and November 20, 2011, implementation, by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) of its Open Internet Order has focused attention on the issue. A consensus on the net neutrality issue has remained elusive and support for the FCC's Open Internet Order has been mixed. While some Members of Congress support the action, and in some cases would have supported an even stronger approach, others feel that the FCC has overstepped its authority and that the regulation of the Internet is not only unnecessary, but harmful.

The FCC is statutorily required to review these rules every four years to determine whether they continue to serve the public interest or should be modified or eliminated. One part of these rules, the FCC's attribution rules, identify criteria for determining when an entity holds sufficient ownership or control of a broadcast station that such ownership or control should be attributed to the entity for the purposes of applying the media ownership rules.", "In December 2011, the FCC proposed a number of rule changes, which it has not yet adopted. It proposed eliminating its Radio/Television Cross-Ownership rule because it is no longer needed to foster the goals of diversity of voices and localism. It also proposed modifying its Newspaper/Broadcast Cross-Ownership rule to allow certain types of combinations in the 20 largest markets. It proposed a technical change in its Local Television Ownership Rule, but otherwise would continue to prohibit ownership of two stations in a local market unless one is not among the four highest-ranked stations in the market and, after the combination, there would still be eight independently owned and operating commercial full-power television stations. The FCC proposed that its Local Radio Ownership and Dual Network rules be retained as is. The FCC also sought public comment on how to define the criteria for an entity to be eligible for programs intended to promote the diversity of media ownership, and, in particular, to promote ownership by women and minorities.", "In recent years, many television stations have entered into sharing arrangements with other stations in their local markets to jointly sell advertising and/or produce local news programming, typically with one station managing that shared operation and perhaps providing most or all of the staffing and other resources. The FCC sought public comment on how, for the purposes of the media ownership rules, to attribute control of a broadcast television station that has entered into such a sharing arrangement. Currently, the only sharing agreement-related attribution rule for television stations covers local marketing agreements in which one station purchases blocks of time from another station in the same market and sells the advertising for the purchased time (that is, the broker station provides both the programming and the advertising) for at least 15% of the brokered station's broadcasting time. The FCC has enforced this as a bright-line rule. As long as (1) the block of time covered by an agreement does not exceed 15% of the brokered station's programming time, and (2) the agreement contains a certification and perhaps other language indicating that the licensee of the brokered station maintains ultimate control over station finances, personnel, and programming, the agreement will not trigger the attribution rule. Other evidence is considered immaterial. As a result, in many cases the FCC has not deemed a station to have control over another station in the same market even if such control is considered to exist, and must be reported, under generally accepted accounting practices. Such agreements create what is known in the industry as \"virtual duopolies.\"", "In late 2012, the FCC released (and made available for public comment) a report on broadcast ownership by gender, ethnicity, and race, and invited the public to comment on how its proposed ownership rule changes might affect female and minority ownership. It delayed adoption of new broadcast ownership rules until those public comments could be analyzed. Responding to that report, the Minority Media and Telecommunications Council asked the FCC for an additional delay so it could conduct a study of the likely impact of the FCC's proposed rule changes on female and minority ownership. The National Association of Broadcasters supports that delay and the FCC has agreed to it.

CPB's appropriation is allocated through a distribution formula established in its authorizing legislation and has historically received two-year advanced appropriations. On March 22, 2013, President Obama signed a Continuing Resolution (CR) of federal funding for FY2013 into law ( H.J.Res. 117 , P.L. 112-175 ). It maintains CPB's advanced appropriations for FY2013 at $445 million from October 1, 2012, through October 1, 2013.

It is also important to note that many congressional policymakers defend the federal role of funding public broadcasting. They contend that it provides news and information to large segments of the population that seek to understand complex policy issues in depth, and, in particular for children's television broadcasting, that it has a significant and positive impact on early learning and education for children.

It re-established the federal 9-1-1 Implementation Coordination Office (ICO) to advance planning for next-generation systems and to administer a grant program. Previously, recognizing the importance of providing effective 9-1-1 service, Congress passed three major bills supporting improvements in the handling of 9-1-1 calls. The Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999 ( P.L. 106-81 ) established 9-1-1 as the number to call for emergencies and gave the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) authority to regulate many aspects of the service.

Section 6409 is not without its ambiguities, however. No definition is provided in the statute for the terms \"tower\" or \"base station.\"\u00a0Furthermore, no definition is provided for what it might mean to \"substantially change the physical dimensions\" of a tower.\u00a0These ambiguities may cause difficulty in applying the new provision to future collocation requests. They may be resolved either by federal courts during litigation or by the FCC in a declaratory rulemaking to define the terms.", "While Congress attempted to streamline the process of collocation on existing wireless towers, the FCC has engaged in a similar effort to streamline the process of collocation of equipment on existing poles owned by utility companies. Section 224 of the Communications Act (47 U.S.C. \u00a7224) grants the Commission the authority to regulate the rates, terms, and conditions for pole attachments, which are defined by the statute as \"any attachment by a cable television system or provider of a telecommunications service to a pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way owned or controlled by a utility.\" In 2011, the FCC issued an order revising its interpretation of Section 224 to allow incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) for the first time to share some of the benefits of Section 224; reformulate (i.e., lower) the rates utilities could charge telecommunications carriers, bringing those rates closer to the rates charged to cable providers; and reformulate the timing of the calculation of refunds when attachers are overcharged.

The court found that while Section 224 did exclude ILECs from the definition of telecommunications carriers, that exclusion only applied to Section 224(e), which permits the FCC to regulate charges for pole attachments to telecommunications carriers when the parties fail to resolve a dispute regarding those charges. The FCC was permitted to interpret Section 224(a), which allows the Commission to regulate pole attachments for providers of telecommunications services more generally, to apply to ILECs.

Several of these provisions make it easier for satellite operators to import the programming of distant network television stations to households that cannot receive that programming from a local television station, by creating a low cost compulsory license for the copyrighted works contained in the network programming and by allowing the satellite operator to retransmit the programming without first obtaining the consent of the distant television station. In most other situations, satellite operators (and cable operators) must obtain the prior consent of broadcasters when retransmitting their signals.

There would be competitive implications if the satellite copyright license were eliminated, but not the cable copyright license. Currently, there is no statutory compulsory copyright license provision for the retransmission of broadcast signals by online video distributors and therefore online distributors seeking to provide their subscribers with broadcast signals must negotiate copyright fees directly with the copyright holders.

The act also included provisions to apply future spectrum license auction revenues toward deficit reduction and to establish a planning and governance structure to deploy public safety broadband networks, using some spectrum license auction proceeds for that purpose.", "For Further Information", "CRS Report R40674, Spectrum Policy in the Age of Broadband: Issues for Congress , by [author name scrubbed].", "CRS Report R42886, The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA): Issues for the 113 th Congress , by [author name scrubbed]."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Universal Service Fund Reform", "paragraphs": ["Since its creation in 1934 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has been tasked with \"mak[ing] available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States ... a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communications service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.\" (Communications Act of 1934, as amended, Title I \u00a71 [47 U.S.C. 151].) This mandate led to the development of what has come to be known as the universal service concept.", "The universal service concept, as originally designed, called for the establishment of policies to ensure that telecommunications services are available to all Americans, including those in rural, insular, and high cost areas, by ensuring that rates remain affordable. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-104 ; 47 U.S.C., 1996 act) codified the long-standing commitment by U.S. policymakers to ensure universal service in the provision of telecommunications services (\u00a7254), and the FCC established, in 1997, a federal Universal Service Fund (USF) to meet the objectives and principles contained in the act. The USF was designed to provide subsidies for voice telecommunications services for eligible high-cost telecommunications carriers (High Cost Program) and economically needy individuals (Low Income Program); access for telecommunications services and broadband access for schools and libraries (Schools and Libraries Program); and access to telecommunications, advanced telecommunications, and information services for public and non-profit rural health care providers (Rural Health Care Program).", "One of the major policy debates surrounding universal service in the last decade was whether access to advanced telecommunications services (i.e., broadband) should be incorporated into universal service objectives. With the growing importance and acceptance of broadband and Internet access, gaps in access to such services, particularly in rural areas, generated concern. A growing number of policymakers felt that the USF should play a role in helping to alleviate this availability gap. This debate was put to rest when provisions contained in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) called for the FCC to develop, and submit to Congress, a national broadband plan (NBP) to ensure that every American has \"access to broadband capability.\" (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, P.L. 111-5 , \u00a76001 (k)(2)(D).) This plan, Connecting America: The National Broadband Plan, submitted to Congress on March 16, 2010, called for the USF to play a major role in achieving this goal. However, with the exception of funding for schools and libraries and rural health care providers, the USF was not designed to directly support broadband.", "The FCC, in an October 2011 decision, adopted an order that calls for the USF to be transformed, in stages, over a multi-year period, from a mechanism to support voice telephone service to one that supports the deployment, adoption, and utilization of both fixed and mobile broadband. More specifically, the High Cost Program is to be phased out and a new fund, the Connect America Fund (CAF), which includes the targeted Mobility Fund and new Remote Areas Fund, is to be created to replace it; and the Low Income, Schools and Libraries, and Rural Health Care programs are to be modified and given wider responsibilities.", "This transition is a vast undertaking and has caused considerable debate as policymakers balance the myriad goals and objectives to modernize the USF. As the USF undergoes this major and unprecedented transition it is anticipated that Congress will continue to assess the impact of these reforms and the FCC's progress in their implementation.", "For Further Information", "CRS Report R42524, Rural Broadband: The Roles of the Rural Utilities Service and the Universal Service Fund , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed]."], "subsections": []}]}}
