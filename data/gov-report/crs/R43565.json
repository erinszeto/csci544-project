The MSFCMA was last reauthorized and extensively amended in 2006 (P.L. 109-479). Although the authorization of appropriations under the MSFCMA expired at the end of FY2013, the act's requirements continue in effect and Congress has continued to appropriate funds to administer the act. Historically, reauthorization has also provided the opportunity to introduce significant amendments to the act.", "During the first decade after the act was passed in 1976, fishery policy focused on controlling and replacing foreign fishing and developing U.S. fisheries in the newly declared 200-mile Fishery Conservation Zone. After that time, new issues emerged, including recognition of the need to sustain fish populations and respond to overfishing while attempting to satisfy the economic and social needs of recreational and commercial fishermen and fishing communities. Achieving this balance is closely related to allocating federal fishery resources among different users, developing and supporting existing management institutions, and investing in management and research.", "This report covers issues that have been identified during congressional hearings and in legislation introduced during the last three Congresses. Although most issues are not new, they have evolved with changes to the statute, regulations, and fishery management plans. Major issues include (1) flexibility in rebuilding overfished fisheries, (2) annual catch limits, (3) uncertainty and data needs; (4) catch shares (limited access privilege programs), (5) management process and decision making, (6) bycatch, and (7) environmental quality. A variety of other issues are also covered in this report.", "Most of these issues are part of a system of linked elements including ecosystems (fish populations and biophysical elements of the environment), fishing (commercial and recreational fishermen, processors, and other related fishing businesses), management (managers, scientists, and the regulatory system), fishing communities (other related businesses and coastal residents), and markets (wholesale, retail, restaurants, and consumers). Often a change in one element affects other elements. For example, requirements to stop overfishing that use restrictive catch limits may rebuild fish populations, but may also result in short-run harm to fishing businesses and coastal communities.", "During the last three Congresses, over 30 different bills have been introduced to amend portions of the MSFCMA. These bills have covered a wide variety of topics, ranging from proposals to change management for specific fisheries or regions, to general changes to the management process such as requirements of fishery management plans. Oversight hearings concerning MSFCMA reauthorization have been held by the House Committee on Natural Resources and by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. On December 18, 2013, the chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources released a draft that included many elements of previously introduced bills.

Although the MSFCMA has been amended a least 30 times since it was enacted in 1976, the act has retained many of its original elements. The act decentralized the federal management process by setting up regional fishery management councils and requiring extensive public comment during the development of fishery management plans. The MSFCMA also has evolved with changes to fishery resources, the U.S. fishing industry, recreational fishing, and seafood markets. Generally, the challenges of fisheries management have shifted from developing fisheries to addressing conservation of fish populations and the marine environment.

Historically, reauthorization has also provided the opportunity to introduce significant amendments to the act. As Congress considers reauthorization, it faces the ongoing challenge of balancing utilization and conservation of fish populations. Some of the main questions revolve around stopping overfishing and rebuilding fish stocks while maintaining the well-being of fishermen and fishing communities. Related management issues involve the quality of data and stock assessments used for managing fisheries and the amount of flexibility allowed in the management process. ", "During the last three Congresses, a number of bills have been introduced to address these issues and other concerns related to fisheries management. House and Senate committees have been pursuing efforts to reauthorize the MSFCMA during the 113 th Congress. Oversight and reauthorization hearings have been held by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House Committee on Natural Resources. In December 2013, the Chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources released a reauthorization discussion draft. The draft includes several sections that reflect topics covered by bills introduced in previous sessions of Congress.

Although there is general agreement that stocks should not be overfished and overfished stocks should be rebuilt, questions remain with regard to the timing of management actions, the choice of management objectives, how stock management objectives should be achieved, and the information needed to make these determinations. Several interrelated issues have emerged during the ongoing debate over requirements to use annual catch limits (ACLs) and to rebuild fish populations. General categories of issues include (1) providing for greater flexibility during stock rebuilding; (2) incorporating new data and uncertainty when using ACLs; (3) improving the decision-making process; (4) establishing limited access privileges; and (5) reducing bycatch. Meanwhile, managers must also contend with environmental factors over which they often have no control such as climate change and the loss and degradation of fish habitat. Decreasing environmental quality may be the greatest long-term threat to the productivity of many fish populations.

The MSFCMA was amended to require development and use of ACLs to end overfishing for all federally managed stocks in the 2010 fishing year. Overfished stocks are required to have rebuilding plans that adhere to a 10-year timeframe (with some exceptions). Previously, managers often delayed action or set indirect controls on fishing such as gear restrictions or closed areas, sometimes with disastrous results for the fishery. RFMCs and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) are now required to set ACLs (quotas) within specific biologically determined levels. ", "Fishery management plans (FMPs) must be consistent with the 10 national standards in Section 301(a) of the MSFCMA. Council members must address the national standards as they develop FMPs and, when considering approval, the Secretary of Commerce determines whether FMPs are consistent with these national standards. The national standards cover a broad range of basic fishery management objectives. The first National Standard Section 301(a)(1) states: \"Conservation and management measures shall prevent overfishing while achieving, on a continuing basis, the optimum yield from each fishery for the United States fishing industry.\"", "Provisions of the MSFCMA enacted during the 1996 reauthorization and amended during the 2006 reauthorization added specific requirements to end overfishing and to rebuild overfished fish stocks. To implement these requirements, the MSFCMA directed the National Marine Fisheries Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to update National Standard 1 guidelines by 2008 to provide guidance for establishing annual catch limits (ACLs) and related biological benchmarks. ", "On January 16, 2009, NMFS issued guidelines that describe fishery management approaches to meet the objectives of National Standard 1 with emphasis on new requirements to end overfishing and rebuild overfished stocks. While implementing ACL requirements, NMFS has identified a number of issues that may require additional revisions to the National Standard 1 guidelines. On May 3, 2012 NOAA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to request public comments on potential adjustments to the guidelines. No further action has been taken since the Summary of Comments on Advanced Rulemaking was published.", "The terms overfishing and overfished are often confused and assumed to occur together, but this is not necessarily the case. According to the National Standard Guidelines: ", "overfishing occurs whenever a stock or stock complex is subjected to a rate or level of fishing mortality that jeopardizes the capacity of a stock or complex to produce Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) on a continuing basis. A stock or stock complex is considered overfished when its biomass has declined below a level that jeopardizes the capacity of the stock or stock complex to produce MSY on a continuing basis. ", "Overfishing occurs when the rate of removals (catch or harvest) is high relative to the size of the fish stock; fish stocks are overfished when their biomass is relatively low. At certain points during rebuilding, removals may be low (no overfishing), but the stock is still overfished (its biomass is not yet rebuilt). Conversely, removals may be high and overfishing may be occurring, but the stock biomass has not declined to the point at which the stock is considered to be overfished. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Issues", "paragraphs": ["Stock rebuilding has become controversial because rebuilding timeframes have required strict constraints on harvest levels. Some have questioned whether greater flexibility in determining the length of stock rebuilding periods could increase economic benefits from the fishery. Rebuilding plans with greater flexibility could also contribute to other fishery management goals such as needs of fishing communities (National Standard 8). ", "Overfishing has been arrested in most U.S. fisheries and progress has been made in rebuilding many others. As of December 31, 2013, of the 300 stocks with a known overfishing status, 28 stocks were subject to overfishing and of the 230 stocks with a known overfished status, 40 stocks are classified as overfished. NOAA also reported that 34 fish stocks have been rebuilt since 2000. ", "According to a recent National Research Council (NRC) study, \"fishing mortality of stocks placed under rebuilding plans has generally been reduced and stock biomass has generally increased following reductions in fishing mortality.\" However, these improvements have sometimes come at a cost to commercial and recreational fishermen and associated fishing communities, and in some cases stocks have not responded to management actions as managers anticipated. The NRC study attributed some of the mixed performance of rebuilding plans to scientific uncertainty and a mismatch between policy makers' expectations for scientific precision and the inherent limits of science. The NRC study adds that mixed outcomes of rebuilding plans have \"added to concerns with the significant social and economic costs associated with implementation of time-constrained rebuilding plans.\""], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Stakeholder Views", "paragraphs": ["Fishermen and fishing communities sometimes suffer from economic and social effects of harvest restrictions needed to satisfy MSFCMA overfishing and stock rebuilding requirements. Many question whether these requirements adequately address the complexities and uncertainties associated with managing fish stocks. Often fishermen express doubt over the efficacy of fish population assessments used for developing management measures because of data constraints and inadequate population models. Furthermore, they refer to studies showing that other factors, often outside the immediate control of fisheries managers, such as environmental conditions and the quality of fish habitat, also affect fish population abundance. ", "Others, including environmentalists and fishery managers, counter that overfishing and previous management failures illustrate the need to maintain established fish stock rebuilding schedules. They emphasize that relatively short-term sacrifices today will result in long-term economic gains to recreational and commercial fishermen in the future. They point to stocks that have been rebuilt since 2000 and cite notable examples of fully rebuilt stocks such as Northeast scallop, Mid-Atlantic bluefish, and Pacific lingcod.", "Environmentalists also have asserted that many species could be rebuilt within 5 years and that the 10-year requirement is a balance between biology of most species and short-term concerns of some managers and fishermen. Exceptions have been provided for many species that have rebuilding timeframes greater than 10 years because of their life history. Others contend that the 10-year rebuilding timeframe is arbitrary and that the lack of flexibility prevents regulators from pursuing a more balanced approach."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Economic Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Economists and social scientists have questioned whether rebuilding plans that ignore the unique characteristics of each fishery, such as social and economic considerations, may result in significant loss of social welfare. They contend that stock rebuilding targets should not be based solely on biological factors. Depending on the productivity of the stock, characteristics of the fishery, and the discount rate, extending the rebuilding timeframe may increase economic benefits. Moreover, economic and social analysis can be useful when developing management measures used to achieve management objectives. Recognition of economic factors can ensure that the least costly or least socially disruptive management alternatives have been considered. Some social scientists argue that economic and social analyses are often incorporated after biological objectives have been established. For these reasons some social scientists have stressed the need to integrate social and economic elements from the beginning of the process.", "Increasing management flexibility also might improve short-term economic returns and lessen immediate social impacts on commercial and recreational fishermen. When factors outside of the control of fisheries managers occur such as environmental changes, management flexibility also might lessen the severity of economic and social disruption to fishermen until conditions improve. It has been reported that most fish stocks experience productivity regime shifts related to natural environmental fluctuations. However, for some fisheries existing flexibility may be adequate and in these cases greater flexibility could delay or stop progress toward stock rebuilding and increase long-term social costs. Unfortunately, developing specific rules for all fisheries is difficult if not impossible because fisheries are diverse with regard to the biology of target species, technology of harvesting strategies, and socioeconomic elements of related communities.", "Others have expressed concerns that managers have lost sight of the original fisheries management goals related to employment, food supply, revenue, and recreational opportunities. According to recent congressional testimony by Dr. Ray Hilborn, a consequence of reducing overfishing is to underutilize other fish stocks. The testimony asserts that 77% of stocks are underfished and 30-48% of U.S. potential yield is lost by underfishing. At the same time 22% of stocks that are overfished only constitute 1-3% of potential yield because they contribute to relatively small fisheries. He postulates that that lack of fishing effort associated with underfishing occurs for a number of reasons such as the lack of markets, but one of the primary factors is because precautionary regulations have been imposed to prevent overfishing. However, economic profitability of commercial harvesting is maximized at fishing effort levels below those which produce MSY. Consideration of economic efficiency under national standard 5 is another management objective that could be met by decreasing fishing effort to maximize net benefits instead of maximizing production. Unfortunately, satisfying management objectives is often more complex because of other elements of the system that require consideration such as recreational fishing allocations and benefits, processing and marketing sectors, and the well-being of fishing communities.", "The requirements to stop overfishing and rebuild stocks by using ACLs may improve fishing in the long run, but they also affect the allocation of fishing opportunities, catch, and benefits among fishermen and related businesses. Questions arise with respect to when benefits will accrue to fishermen and who will ultimately benefit when stocks have been rebuilt. Distributional issues may exist among different commercial gear types, commercial and recreational fishermen, and ports or communities. The effects of stock rebuilding may vary across different segments of the fishing industry such as support services, harvesters, processors, wholesalers, and retailers. There is also a temporal dimension to allocation for many fisheries because of the potential decoupling of present costs and future benefits. Often there are few if any guarantees that those who endure the immediate costs of ACLs and rebuilding programs will benefit in the future because of the weak nature of property rights in many fisheries and the inability of some fishermen to remain in the fishing industry when economic returns decline.", "Specific segments of fishing fleets, especially small-scale or traditional fishermen, and fishing communities may be affected disproportionately by requirements to end overfishing and by stock rebuilding programs. Like many segments of the U.S. economy, the fishing industry is changing, in this case due to a mixture of factors related to technology, social views, and resource limits. The current emphasis of fisheries management on long-term sustainability has resulted in less flexibility for fishermen; fishermen often find regulations restrict their access to fisheries, especially in cases where strict stock rebuilding is required. In some cases smaller vessels and specific coastal communities have been affected disproportionately because of their scale. For example, requirements to carry observers are disproportionately costly for smaller businesses and alternatives such as more distant fishing grounds may not be accessible by smaller vessels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Multispecies Fisheries", "paragraphs": ["Multispecies fisheries are often difficult to manage because the fishery may consist of both healthy and overfished stocks. Harvesting one stock at its optimum yield may result in overfishing of another stock when the two stocks are caught together as part of one fishery or when one of the stocks is caught as bycatch in another fishery. Fishing on healthy stocks is sometimes constrained by restrictions to promote rebuilding of another stock(s) that have been identified as overfished. When the quota of the overfished stock is reached, the entire fishery may be closed or curtailed. For example, over 90 species of groundfish are managed by the Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council, but fishing regulations are driven by eight species that are under rebuilding plans. This has led to under-fishing of healthy stocks and lost yield from underfishing amounts to 30% of total sustainable yield. This infers that greater flexibility in rebuilding timelines would allow for greater profits in this fishery.", "Most observers would agree that a biological biomass threshold is necessary to avoid depletion of overfished populations or, in the worst case, to avoid extinction. However, some question whether there should be greater flexibility in setting the level of stock biomass thresholds for weaker stocks in multispecies fisheries. The NMFS Guidelines attempt to address this issue with the mixed stock exception. The purpose of the mixed stock exception is to provide managers with a means to achieve Optimum Yield (OY) for some species while allowing overfishing of other species. According to the 2009 guidelines, the mixed stock exception may allow overfishing, but not if the stock is overfished or if the stock would be decreased to levels which would require stock rebuilding. Generally, it appears that as currently specified in the guidelines the mixed stock exception could only be used in limited circumstances and not in cases where stock have already been overfished.

If ACLs are set at appropriate levels as required by MSFCMA, this action would end overfishing for all federally managed fish stocks. ACLs are defined in NMFS guidelines as the level of annual catch of a stock or stock complex that may not exceed allowable biological catch and serves as the basis for using accountability measures (AMs). AMs are actions taken to ensure that rebuilding will continue when adjustments are needed relative to the ACL. AMs include measures taken during the season to prevent the ACL from being exceeded or adjustments in the next fishing year to compensate for overages if the ACL was exceeded.

The NOAA Guidelines identify two types of uncertainty \u2013 management uncertainty and scientific uncertainty. Management uncertainty occurs because of the lack of information on actual catch due to illegal activity, late reporting of catch, misreporting catch, or non-reporting of bycatch. Landings data are rarely complete, especially for those fisheries with significant discards or a large recreational component. In these cases, managers have insufficient information to know whether an ACL has been reached and to make related management decisions such as slowing fishing effort or closing the fishery. ", "Scientific uncertainty is the uncertainty associated with the estimates of stock biomass and fishing mortality rates. Scientific uncertainty may occur for different reasons including limited biological data for many fisheries and inadequate stock assessment models. Furthermore, even for the most closely studied stocks, spawning success and future recruitment to the population are difficult to predict. The relationship between the abundance of spawning adults and recruitment (off-spring entering the populations) is confounded by biological and environmental factors. Assessments are also out of date by the time they are completed. First there is a lag between the time data are collected and the time taken to compile data and complete the assessment. Assessments are usually undertaken every three to five years because of funding constraints. Sometimes unpredictable and significant changes may occur before updates can be undertaken. In addition, factors affecting management uncertainty such as mischaracterization of catch may also increase scientific uncertainty. Some level of uncertainty is inevitable because of the nature of scientific information, the fishery resources, and the fisheries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ecosystem Component Stocks", "paragraphs": ["The 2009 guidelines suggest classifying fish stocks into two groups\u2014stocks in the fishery and ecosystem component species. Stocks classified as being in the fishery would include certain target species and sometimes non-target species that the councils and/or the Secretary believe require conservation and management. To encourage ecosystem management, NMFS created the ecosystem component species group. Stocks in the fishery require determinations of their condition, reference points and ACLs while ecosystem component species do not. The guidelines define ecosystem component species or stocks as nontarget species, species not subject to overfishing, species not likely to become subject to overfishing or being overfished, and species not generally retained for sale or personal use. Although not considered to be in the fishery, the guidelines encourage councils to consider measures to protect the role of ecosystem component species in the ecosystem by minimizing bycatch and bycatch mortality."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issues", "paragraphs": ["Disagreement about the use of ACLs is related in part to management and scientific uncertainties. Regardless of whether stock assessments are uncertain, ACLs are required for all fisheries and in some cases ACLs may impose strict constraints on the fishery. To ensure ACLs are not exceeded managers are now taking precautionary approaches when determining allowable catch. These concerns with uncertainties and the effect on fisheries have prompted proposals to improve stock assessments or to exclude certain stocks from ACL requirements. Some regions such as the North Pacific, which has a history of using catch limits, have adjusted to ACL requirements, while fisheries which used indirect controls on harvest in regions such as the Northeast have been subject to greater controversy and social and economic disruption. ", "Approaches to reducing uncertainty usually focus on technical improvements such as collecting more and better data and improving assessment models. Often many recommend dedicating more resources for data collection and stock assessments. They reason that by reducing risk of overfishing associated with uncertainty, the need for precautionary measures could be lessened. However, data and modeling improvements are likely to be costly and would require further increases of federal appropriations. The benefits of a closer approximation of benchmark population levels such as Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) are limited. Thus the value of these improvements must conform to the rule of diminishing returns. As more resources are directed to this purpose the marginal benefits of lower uncertainty decrease. An unanswered question for many fisheries is whether the current management system is in need of greater investment or if it has already reached the level where costs of additional information are greater than the benefits derived from greater certainty.

Of the 478, there were 178 with an unknown overfishing status and 258 with an unknown overfished status. Many of the data-poor stocks are of relatively low value or minor components of fisheries. However, it should be noted that many believe these stocks provide biological diversity and ecological value to the system. ", "One option open to managers is to use recent average catch as a basis for establishing ACLs. Another option is to group several stocks into a stock complex and use one or more indicator stocks within the complex. This option relies on the assumption that the stock complex can be managed and monitored using one or more stocks that can be assessed. Another option might involve moving stocks to the ecosystem components species category to exclude them from ACL requirements.

The Gulf of Maine cod stock is a recent example of the difficulties fisheries scientists face in assessing fish populations, even when the stock is relatively well-studied. Gulf of Maine cod is one of the most valuable species of the Northeast multispecies fishery and the mainstay of many inshore fishermen. The stock assessment reviewed at the Groundfish Assessment Review Meeting (GARM III) in 2008 indicated that overfishing was still taking place in 2007, but the stock was no longer overfished (stock biomass had increased above the level that defines it as overfished). Instead of further progress, the 2011 stock assessment reviewed at the 53 rd Stock Assessment Workshop (53 rd SAW) showed that overfishing continued in 2010 and stock spawning biomass was one-third of the level estimated in 2007 indicating the stock was also overfished.

Recreational catch is difficult to quantify because landings are widely dispersed and taken by many different participants. When a significant percentage of catch is taken by recreational fishermen, it usually adds to uncertainties in developing stock assessments. Furthermore, recreational quotas are often difficult to manage on a real-time basis because of their nature. Overages may be common because catch is compiled using statistical models that may calculate totals months after the annual fishery is finished. These factors may lead to unpredictable recreational openings and closures and the use of accountability measures (AMs) in subsequent years that may limit quotas significantly. Replacement of the Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey with the new Marine Recreational Information Program is focused on improving recreational data, but it may take several years before this information can be fully incorporated into the management process.

Congress later extended the moratorium to September of 2002 after which it was allowed to expire. Since the moratorium expired, ten new programs have been established bringing the total number of federal catch share programs to fifteen. ", "Typically without catch shares, annual quotas or annual catch limits are established by fishery scientists and managers and made available to all fishermen who have permits to operate in the fishery. When the annual quota is reached, the fishery is usually closed to prevent overfishing of fish stocks. Management with a fishery-wide quota provides an incentive for fishermen to gain the greatest share of the total quota, often as quickly as possible, before the fishery is closed. This outcome has been characterized as \"derby fishing\" or the \"race to fish.\"", "Academic research and evaluations of existing catch share programs have shown that catch shares can change incentives and improve economic efficiency. Allocating the total quota among permit holders changes incentives because entities such as individual fishermen or cooperatives possess a secure share of the quota. By providing fishermen with their own quota, investments in vessels, equipment, and crew to compete with others for a greater share of the total quota become unnecessary. Instead investments are likely to be more closely aligned with the individual fisherman's allocation. If quota shares are transferable, vessel owners may purchase or sell quota to match the needs of their business. ", "Catch shares may also provide fishermen with greater flexibility to land fish when conditions such as markets and weather are most favorable. Markets often improve under catch share systems because landings can be spread out over a longer period instead of shortened seasons with high landings and lower prices.

In some cases, those fishermen who are allocated quota gain a onetime windfall equal to the discounted value of all future profits from the individual quota. Some perceive this outcome as unfair to others in the industry such as crew members or future fishermen. Some fishermen who are not allocated enough quota to be economically viable, may have to sell their share to those with more capital. For those who want to leave the fishery this could be an advantage, but not for those who do not wish to leave. Catch shares may shift landings and affect specific fishing ports disproportionately. For example, in the Alaska halibut catch share (IFQ) fishery, small remote fishing communities have lost fishing rights because residents have been more likely to sell than buy quota.

Some fishermen are concerned that this will change the nature of fisheries and make small scale fishing unprofitable. If consolidation occurs, investments in gear and vessels may be utilized more efficiently, but the number of crew employed in the fishery may also decrease.

Producers of seafood may also obtain a price premium if consumers are willing to pay extra for an environmentally friendly product. If consumers are willing to pay the price premium, the ecolabel could provide an economic incentive for fisheries to adopt sustainable fishing practices.", "Ecolabeled seafood is recognized by a seal that is placed on the product's packaging to certify that it has met specific criteria related to its production. Criteria are developed by a standard setting organization such as the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). These criteria are used to evaluate the fishery and determine whether it can be certified as sustainable. Certification of the chain of custody is also needed to ensure that seafood from the certified fishery is kept separate from uncertified seafood. Finally, wholesalers, processors, and retailers who sell certified seafood are required to follow certain standards regarding use of the ecolabel.", "Another way to convey information related to seafood sustainability is through published guides. Seafood guides range from pocket guides used by consumers in restaurants and grocery stores to more comprehensive online guides.

Often the fishing industry faces hardships associated with the natural variability of marine fish populations and management efforts to sustain populations above specific levels. These hardships are compounded when stock rebuilding becomes necessary. A critical fisheries policy question is whether it is in the national interest to provide greater management flexibility, increase resources for management and research, and generally expand support for commercial fishing and associated communities. ", "Seafood is the last major food source that depends on harvest of wild populations from the natural environment. When fisheries were being developed fishermen often had flexibility to target different species or move to different areas if resource abundance decreased. As limits to natural production were reached and most fish stocks become fully or overexploited, regulations become more rigid and complex. Fishery managers and fishermen have little or no control over natural production except to change fishing effort and associated fishing mortality. These regulatory efforts can increase fish population abundance and production in some fisheries, but with timing and outcomes that are often uncertain. In the agricultural sector, programs have been developed to help farmers manage financial risks caused by variations in the natural environment such as drought, floods, or disease. To some degree the well-being of producers, communities, lending institutions, and other input sectors are protected by programs such as crop insurance and other types of disaster relief. Some have questioned whether similar programs are needed for the fishing industry, albeit with refinements that consider the unique nature of fisheries. ", "Many agree that more resources for data collection and stock assessments are needed to improve the understanding of marine ecosystems and marine populations. They reason that through more precise information and by reducing the risk of overfishing, the need for precautionary measures could be lessened and fishing could be increased while remaining within biological limits. However, the benefits associated with marginal improvements in information will decrease with increasing investments in this area. At some point the costs associated with collecting more information become greater than the associated benefits. Regardless of how much data, assessments, and management are improved, constraints to fishing associated with limits to natural production and unpredictable variations in the natural environment will still occur. ", "Managers must also contend with environmental factors over which they have no control such as climate change and the loss and degradation of fish habitat. Environmental degradation reduces the resiliency of marine and coastal ecosystems and the productivity of marine resources. It also decreases or shifts the geographic range and size of marine populations such as fish and protected species (marine mammals and endangered species). Managers are challenged to find ways to maintain the productivity and health of marine systems and associated populations while minimizing constraints on a variety of economic activities. This may require greater reliance on developing management systems that recognize linkages across government agencies, scientific disciplines, and different oceans activities.", "Some would question whether current management institutions can incorporate resource constraints and variability while minimizing disruption of livelihoods and the nature of coastal communities. Some have advocated for catch share programs because of the flexibility they can provide to fishermen. However, many fishermen are skeptical of catch share programs because of issues related to allocation and unanticipated outcomes. Further progress in this area will require integration of social and cultural concerns as well as bioeconomic analysis. Cooperative research and greater industry input during data collection and analysis have also been considered as management costs have increased and information collection requirements have expanded. As marine fisheries evolve many will continue to question the respective roles and investments of public (federal, regional, and state), and private institutions. ", "Appendix A. MSFCMA Background", "Federal Fisheries Management History", "Historically, coastal states managed marine sport and commercial fisheries in nearshore state waters, where most seafood was caught. On September 28, 1945, President Truman issued two proclamations addressing U.S. rights to marine resources beyond the U.S. 3-mile territorial sea. The proclamations expressed the need to conserve and manage living resources and to establish conservation zones in areas of the high seas adjacent to the coasts of the United States. However, the rights proclaimed for fishing did not provide for exclusive jurisdiction over fisheries resources. As fishing technology advanced and market demand increased, fishermen built up fishing capacity, increased catches, and fished more intensively in offshore areas. ", "In the 1950s and 1960s, increasing numbers of foreign fishing vessels began operating in waters adjacent to the United States. Since the United States only claimed a 3-mile jurisdiction, foreign vessels could fish many of the same stocks caught by U.S. fishermen. U.S. fishermen deplored this \"foreign encroachment\" and alleged that overfishing was causing stress on, or outright depletion of, fish stocks. United Nations Law of the Sea Treaty negotiations in the early and mid-1970s as well as actions by other coastal nations provided impetus for unilateral U.S. action to declare jurisdiction over fisheries resources within 200 miles of the coastline.", "When the United States enacted the Fishery Conservation and Management Act (FCMA, P.L. 94-265 ), later renamed the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MFCMA, P.L. 97-191 ) and more recently the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA, 109-479), it created a new system of federal fishery management. After several years of debate the FCMA was signed into law on April 13, 1976. On March 1, 1977, marine fishery resources within 200 miles of all U.S. coasts, but outside state waters, came under federal jurisdiction. Initially a substantial portion of the fish caught from federal offshore waters was allocated to foreign fishing fleets. However, the 1980 American Fisheries Promotion Act (Title II of P.L. 96-561 ) and other FCMA amendments provided incentives to expand domestic fishing and processing industries and decrease foreign catch allocations. On March 10, 1983, the 200-mile fishery conservation zone was superseded by a 200-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ), proclaimed by President Reagan (Presidential Proclamation 5030).", "Management Under the MSFCMA", "With the enactment of the FCMA in 1977, an entirely new, regional management system was established to regulate fisheries with priority given to domestic fishermen. Primary federal management authority was vested in the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS, also popularly referred to as NOAA Fisheries) within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce. ", "The FCMA established eight Regional Fishery Management Councils, which include New England, Mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, Pacific (West Coast), Alaska, and Western Pacific. Each council is comprised of marine fishery management agency representatives from each state in the region, the NMFS regional director, and members appointed by the Secretary of Commerce. Appointments are made from lists of candidates knowledgeable about fishery resources that are submitted by state governors. Councils receive input from a variety of advisory committees, species committees, and ad hoc committees. Each council has a Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) and, depending on the council, various subcommittees for specific species. The SSC provides the council with scientific advice by developing, collecting, evaluating, and reviewing information during development of fishery management plans and amendments. Members of SSCs include individuals knowledgeable in fisheries from state and federal agencies, universities, and the public. ", "Fishery management plans (FMPs) are prepared by each council for those fisheries occurring primarily in federal waters and which require active federal management. FMPs consist of management measures and related actions needed to manage stocks such as catch limits, minimum sizes, seasons, closed areas, vessel permitting, and other measures. Public input is a major element of the council process where the public, including fishermen and environmentalists, provides information and comments during the FMP development process. ", "Most data collection and scientific assessments that support development of FMPs are undertaken by NMFS. Most information is collected and analyzed at NMFS regional science centers and associated laboratories while management functions are conducted from NMFS regional headquarters. After review of the recommendations of appropriate council committees and approval by the council, a proposed action is then submitted to NMFS for review. The review is governed by a strict process that includes additional opportunity for public comment and subsequent approval, partial approval, or disapproval by the Secretary of Commerce. Approved plans are implemented through regulations drafted by NMFS regional management offices and published in the Federal Register. These regulations are enforced by NMFS, the Coast Guard, and state fishery enforcement agencies. Plans are amended periodically to account for changes in the fishery and the need for new management approaches.", "Together these councils and NMFS have developed and implemented 46 FMPs for various fish and shellfish resources, with additional FMPs and FMP amendments in various stages of development. Some plans are created for an individual species or a few related ones (e.g., FMPs for red drum by the South Atlantic Council and for species of shrimp by the Gulf of Mexico Council). Others are developed for larger species assemblages inhabiting similar habitats (e.g., FMPs for Gulf of Alaska groundfish by the North Pacific Council and for reef fish by the Gulf of Mexico Council). NMFS manages wide-ranging Atlantic highly migratory species such as tunas, sharks, swordfish and billfish. Many of the implemented plans have been amended (some more than 30 times), and some plans have been developed and implemented jointly by two or more councils.", "Fisheries Statistics", "The United States has the largest EEZ in the world which includes areas in three oceans (Pacific, Atlantic, and Arctic) with a total area of 3.4 million square nautical miles. These areas also contain some of the most productive fisheries in the world. After passage of the FCMA, foreign catch from the U.S. FCZ declined from about 3.8 billion pounds in 1977 to zero since 1992. Accompanying the decline of foreign catch, domestic offshore catch in federal waters increased dramatically, from about 1.6 billion pounds (1977) to more than 6.3 billion pounds in 1986-1988. After this peak, annual landings from federal waters have generally ranged from 5 to around 6.5 billion pounds. ( Figure A-1 .)

Exports were 3.3 billion pounds valued at $5.5 billion. Imports are generally composed of relatively high valued species such as shrimp and salmon, and products that have been processed to some degree.

Recreational catch that was retained totaled approximately 140 million fish and weighed about 203 million pounds. Most fishing trips were taken on the Atlantic coast (38 million), followed by the Gulf coast (24 million), and the Pacific coast (5.7 million). In 2011, a nationwide survey, conducted every five years, estimated that saltwater recreational anglers spent more than $10.3 billion on their fishing trips and equipment.", "Constituencies", "A variety of groups are involved in managing and utilizing marine fisheries. Although they often share general goals related to maintaining productivity and healthy ecosystems, they often disagree on how to achieve these goals. The following characterizations are general and may vary considerably depending on region and fishery.

Advocates of most categories of groups also include national, regional, and local representation as well as individuals or informal groups. ", "Recreational", "Recreational interests include a broad variety of users with different approaches and motivations to fishing. In contrast to commercial fishing, most recreational activities are closely related to the satisfaction that individuals derive from the experience of fishing or observing fish. Generally, activities include a range of often overlapping categories such as non-extractive sports such as snorkeling and scuba diving where utility is gained from observing the marine environment; catch and release fishing where the experience of catching fish is the main objective; and extractive recreational fishing where anglers catch fish for consumption. Different modes of recreational angling include fishing from shore, boats, and charters or party boats. Charters and party boats are commercial operations which provide fishing opportunities to sport anglers for a fee. Recreational interests are often concerned about decisions affecting access to fisheries and allocation of fishing quotas among different interests. Issues and types of recreational interests also vary by region, species targeted, and mode of fishing. ", "Commercial", "Commercial fishing is composed of diverse interests, but it generally involves the harvest of fish for commercial sale. However, in many cases the commercial fishing participants also gain satisfaction from maintaining their livelihood and independence. Commercial fishing can be divided according to target species, scale, and region. For example, even within a specific fishery, commercial users may have different views depending on fishing gear (e.g., trawl, gillnet, pots, or longline), port, or fishing grounds (e.g., inshore or offshore). There are also many fishing dependent businesses that supply fishermen (e.g., ice, nets, vessel maintenance) and businesses that use the harvest such as processors, wholesalers, and others. During the last two decades increasing emphasis has been placed on the inter-dependence between fishing dependent business and maintaining fishing communities. Although national issues often emerge during reauthorizations, regional issues are sometimes reflected in specific provisions of the act. Most fishing associations and representatives are regional in nature and offer regional perspectives.", "Environmental", "During the last several decades, national and regional environmental groups have gained greater influence in the fishery management process. Initially environmental advocacy focused on indirect harm from the take in fishing gear of marine mammals, sea turtles, and sea birds. Environmental groups expanded their concerns to include overfishing, bycatch, habitat, and marine biodiversity. Interests of environmentalists and fishermen sometimes conflict when fishing may be constrained by greater regulation or coincide for issues such as degradation of habitat from activities other than fishing. ", "Native American ", "Many Native American groups are concerned with marine fishing because of their cultural, traditional, and subsistence links to marine resources. In some cases the federal government is required to protect and maintain the treaty rights of some tribes that guarantee access to certain fishery resources. The long-term goals of tribes and indigenous peoples generally include safeguarding cultural traditions, promoting economic stability, and encouraging resource sustainability. ", "Fishery Scientists and Managers", "Fishery scientists and mangers are generally concerned with conserving and managing fishery resources to ensure future benefits. Scientists from academia, the private sector, and state and federal agencies analyze biological, social, cultural, and economic effects of federal fisheries management policy. One of their primary concerns is the availability of adequate funding for data collection, stock assessments, and other analyses necessary to inform fishery managers.

Features of LAPPs, as provided in the act, include the following:", "allows for allocation of harvesting privileges to individuals, corporations, fishing communities, or regional fishery associations; allows only fisheries that have been operating under a limited access system to be eligible for management under a LAPP system; directs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to develop criteria for eligibility by considering several factors, such as traditional fishing practices, the cultural and social elements of the fishery, and the severity of projected economic and social impacts of LAPPs; allows processors to hold LAPPs and participate in the normal allocation process (but not by allocation of a separate processor quota); and requires a formal and detailed review five years after implementation of each program, and thereafter review within every seven years.", "Information and Research ", "Recreational Fisheries", "Section 201 required improvements in data collection from recreational fisheries. Programs and priorities included the following:", "establishing a national program to create eight regional registry programs for marine recreational fishermen; directing the Secretary to exempt individuals from the regional registry where state programs meet defined criteria; and improving the Marine Recreational Fishery Statistics Survey.", "Cooperative Research", "Section 204 of the MSFCMA amendments directed the Secretary to establish a cooperative research and management program. Requirements of this program include", "identifying projects to be competitively funded by the Secretary, with priority given to collecting data to improve stock assessments, assessing bycatch and mortality, designing technology to reduce bycatch, identifying important habitat, and collecting social and economic data; directing the Secretary of Commerce to establish guidelines to ensure that participation does not result in the loss of a participant's catch history or unexpended days-at-sea as part of a limited entry system; and requiring the Secretary of Commerce to issue regulations for expediting regionally based experimental fishery permits.", "Regional Ecosystem Research ", "Section 210 of the 2006 amendments focused on developing information to implement pilot projects by:", "requiring the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the councils, to study the state of the science for advancing the concepts and integration of ecosystem considerations in regional fishery management; including recommendations in the study for scientific data, information, and technology requirements for understanding ecosystem processes, and methods for integrating information from different sources; incorporating broad stakeholder participation, recommendations to account for environmental variation, and a description of existing and new efforts to implement ecosystem approaches; and providing technical advice and assistance to councils for developing and designing regional pilot programs.", "Other Research", "Other research efforts include", "establishing a deep sea coral research and technology program (\u00a7211); and researching and promoting new gear technologies to further reduce bycatch (\u00a7116);", "International Conservation and Management ", "Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing", "Sections 401-403 of the MSFCMA amendments included provisions to strengthen the ability of international fishery management organizations and the United States to appropriately enforce conservation and management measures for high seas fisheries.
