Despite the current burden of disease, malaria is preventable and treatable. Congress has increasingly recognized malaria as an important foreign policy issue, and the United States has become a major player in the global response to the disease. In its second session, the 112th Congress will likely debate the appropriate funding levels and optimum strategy for addressing the continued challenge of global malaria.", "Congress has enacted several key pieces of legislation related to global malaria control. These include the Assistance for International Malaria Control Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-570); the U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-25); and the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-293). These acts have authorized funds to be used in the fight against malaria and have shaped the ways in which U.S. malaria programs are coordinated and managed, including through the creation of the U.S. Global Malaria Coordinator at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).", "In 2005, in response to growing international calls for global malaria control and to the success of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), President George W. Bush launched the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI), which aims to halve the burden of malaria morbidity and mortality in 70% of at-risk populations in sub-Saharan Africa by 2014. PMI brought significant new attention and funding to U.S. malaria programs and made the United States one of the largest donors for malaria efforts. While U.S. funding for global malaria programs has increased each fiscal year since FY2004, support for malaria interventions increased most precipitously beginning in FY2007 as PMI has expanded into new countries. President Obama has continued to support PMI through the Global Health Initiative (GHI).", "There is evidence that the growing international response to malaria has had some success in controlling the epidemic. Since 2000, global malaria incidence has decreased by 17% and malaria mortality by 26%. Since 2000, 43 countries have reported a reduction in reported malaria cases of more than 50%, including eight African countries that have experienced 50% reduction in either confirmed malaria cases or malaria admissions and deaths. The decreases in each of these African countries are associated with intense malaria control activities. Despite these successes, several key issues pose challenges to an effective scale-up of the response to malaria. First, increasing reports of drug-resistant malaria in Southeast Asia and insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, largely in Africa, threaten the success of malaria control programs. Second, weak health systems, including shortages in health care personnel and inadequate supply chain networks, have limited the delivery of essential commodities for malaria control. There is also debate within the global health community over whether malaria efforts should increasingly target areas where malaria elimination is possible or whether efforts should remain concentrated on malaria control.", "This report outlines basic facts related to global malaria, including characteristics of the epidemic and U.S. legislation, programs, funding, and partnerships related to the global response to malaria.

", "Insecticide-Treated Bed Nets (ITNs): Insecticides used to treat bed nets kill and repel mosquitoes. ITNs are used as personal protection against mosquito bites, but evidence suggests that high community coverage of ITNs can lower the number of mosquitoes in a general area and reduce the life span of mosquitoes that remain. ITNs retain effective levels of insecticide for up to six months. Newly developed long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) last for at least three years. ", "Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS): IRS involves covering household walls with an insecticide to kill any mosquito that comes into contact with the surfaces for several months. To be effective, IRS must be applied to a high percentage (80%) of household surfaces. Resistance to insecticides is a growing concern.

The act authorized $15 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs from FY2004 through FY2008. The act recognized malaria control as a major foreign policy objective, though it did not specify an amount for bilateral malaria programs.

Efforts to expand U.S. malaria programs and improve their coordination increased following the announcement of the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) in 2005. PMI represented a growing acknowledgement of the efficacy of malaria prevention and treatment strategies and built on the success of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in harnessing resources to combat a disease. PMI was initially created as a five-year, $1.2 billion effort to increase U.S. engagement in global malaria control and reduce malaria-related deaths by 50% in 15 high-burden focus countries. Focus countries were selected according to several criteria, including high malaria burden, capacity to implement anti-malaria programs, and willingness to partner with the United States. PMI has since expanded into four other malaria-endemic countries in Africa ( Table 1 ). ", "PMI is an interagency initiative run by USAID and jointly implemented by USAID and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The U.S. Global Malaria Coordinator at USAID coordinates malaria efforts across a number of agencies and departments, including CDC, the Department of Defense (DOD), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Oversight duties are shared with an Interagency Steering Group composed of representatives from USAID, CDC/the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of State, DOD, the National Security Council, and the Office of Management and Budget. USAID and CDC also provide bilateral malaria assistance to a handful of countries not designated as PMI focus countries.

On May 5, 2009, the President announced Global Health Initiative (GHI), a new effort to develop a comprehensive U.S. global health strategy over the course of six years. Malaria is one of the GHI's six priority areas, and PMI is considered a key component of the GHI, reflecting the Administration's belief that scaled-up malaria interventions can help maximize health impact per dollar spent. The GHI calls for a more integrated U.S. response to global health issues, including better coordination between malaria and maternal and child health programs. The GHI also calls for a shift in U.S. global health strategy from one focused on specific diseases to a more comprehensive approach to health, including a focus on health system strengthening.

The United States contributes more to the Global Fund than any other donor. The Global Fund has committed over $22.6 billion in grants in 150 countries since it was established and provides over half of all international funding for malaria control in endemic countries. In November 2011, the Global Fund announced that due to limited resources available, it would postpone its 11 th round of funding. The World Bank: In 2005, the World Bank launched the World Bank Booster Program for Malaria Control in Africa. The Booster Program is implemented in 18 countries and supports the rapid scale-up of preexisting malaria control interventions and works to strengthen in-country procurement and supply-chain capacity, monitoring, and evaluation, and health planning. World Health Organization: WHO is the authority for health within the United Nations system. It is responsible for shaping the global health research agenda, setting norms and standards, articulating evidence-based policy options, providing technical support to countries, and monitoring global health trends. WHO's Global Malaria Program (GMP) promotes global malaria policies and intervention guidelines, provides technical assistance to malaria programs, and supports research and development of anti-malarial drugs and insecticides. Roll Back Malaria (RBM) Partnership: The RBM Partnership was created in 1998 by WHO, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and the World Bank to facilitate coordination of malaria activities and optimal use of resources. The RBM Partnership has 500 partners, including malaria-endemic countries, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) donor governments, multilateral organizations, the private sector, NGOs, foundations, research institutions, and ex-officio members. The Coordinator of PMI currently sits on the RBM Partnership Board. United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF): UNICEF supports malaria programs through its work on child survival and development. UNICEF assists in developing national malaria plans and policies; monitoring and evaluation; and supplying, procuring, and distributing malaria commodities. According to UNICEF, it is the world's largest procurer and deliverer of ITNs. UNICEF and USAID have a \"Malaria Control Partnership\" to support malaria programming and commodity procurement, supply, and distribution. American Red Cross: The American Red Cross malaria programs support distribution of ITNs, community education on the threat of malaria and the proper use of ITNs, and operational research on the effectiveness of ITNs.

Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in combating global malaria. International assistance has helped to lower the number of malaria cases and deaths around the world. At the same time, several key challenges threaten the progress achieved to date. As Congress continues to debate the role of the United States in global malaria control, it might consider the following issues:", "Insecticide and drug resistance : Growing instances of drug-resistant malaria and insecticide-resistant mosquitoes threaten global malaria control, particularly in Southeast Asia and Africa. There are currently no alternatives to available forms of insecticides and treatments. Some health experts argue that anti-malaria resources should prioritize drug and insecticide resistance, including efforts to improve drug quality control, resistance monitoring and surveillance, and research and development of new forms of malaria drugs. Health System Strengthening : Weak health systems have been a major impediment to successful malaria prevention and treatment. In particular, shortages in health care personnel and weak supply chain networks have limited the delivery of essential commodities for malaria control. There is some disagreement within the global health community about whether PMI has had a beneficial or detrimental impact on the broader functioning of health systems. Control vs. elimination: There is debate within the global health community over the degree to which the international community should commit itself to malaria control (reducing the disease burden to a level at which it is no longer a public health problem) or malaria elimination (reducing incidence of infection to zero in a defined geographic). While the majority of international funding for malaria efforts in the past decade has been focused on control efforts, a number of experts have argued that efforts should increasingly focus on elimination of the disease. Key issues affecting the debate over control versus elimination include whether countries have the capacity to support more ambitious programs, whether donor assistance is predictable enough to support elimination efforts, and how the international community can avoid any potentially detrimental consequences of an elimination campaign, such as increased insecticide and drug resistance."], "subsections": []}]}}
