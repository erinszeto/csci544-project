Medicare does not cover most outpatient prescription drugs. Mostseniors have some form of supplementaryhealth insurance to cover expenses not met by Medicare; however, many of these plans do not offer drug coverageor offer limited protection for drug expenses.

Critics of the plan have argued that the plan would not bring additional benefits for seniorsand that retail pharmacies would bear theburden of prescription drug cost reductions for seniors. Shortly after the card initiative was announced in 2001,pharmacy groups successfully filed a lawsuitagainst CMS, asking a federal court to issue an injunction that would halt the card program on the grounds that theAdministration had no statutory authority toestablish the program. The Administration proceeded with plans to modify the program and used a formalrulemaking process for a new proposal. On March 6,2002, CMS issued a proposed rule for the card program with a 60-day comment period. On August 30, 2002, CMSissued the final rule. Although pharmaciescontinued to assert that the Administration lacked the authority to implement the initiative, CMS proceeded withthe program.

The Medicare discount card program would allowprivate companies to develop discount card plans for beneficiaries and apply for Medicare endorsement of theirplans.

The major difference is that the discount cards offered under thePresident's plan would be Medicare-endorsedand would provide consumers with comparative information on the formularies and prices offered within the cardprogram. Another key difference is thatbeneficiaries could have only one Medicare-endorsed card plan.

The companies vary from Internet mail order service companiesto pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) thatoffer discount card services, such as Merck-Medco and the AARP Member Choice Program (provided through theUnited Health Group Incorporated, with mailorder prescriptions filled by Express Scripts).

Pharmacies generally accept the lower price agreed to in the program becausebelonging to the program network results in a largervolume of business. However, the lower prices accepted by the pharmacies may result in lower prescription drugrevenues for the store.", "The operators of card programs typically control the costs of a prescription drug benefit by developing formularies. (7) A formulary is a list of drugs that the cardsponsor generates to provide the higher benefits to participating members at a reduced cost. In deciding which drugsto include in the formulary, the card sponsordetermines which drugs are most cost-effective to include in the list. Discount card programs generally userestricted formularies. Patients may obtain discountsonly on the drugs included in the formulary offered by the card program and must pay full price for the drugs notincluded in the card's formulary. ", "Private discount card programs are similar to other drug benefit programs, such as those offered by private health insurance plans, in that they generally developformularies by consulting with an independent pharmacy and therapeutics (P&T) committee. A number ofdrugs may be used to treat a certain condition ordisease. Such drugs are said to be therapeutically equivalent or belonging to the same therapeutic category. Aformulary does not always include every drug in agiven therapeutic category, but usually includes at least one brand-name drug per category. The P&Tcommittee evaluates the safety, efficacy, substitutability andcost of therapeutically equivalent drugs. The members of the committees and the decision-making process vary byhealthcare plan, but most often includephysicians, pharmacists, medical directors, and/or health plan staff members. Some larger drug benefit sponsors,however, do not allow their staff to participate inP&T committees because of potential conflict of interest. Some health plans say that they emphasize outcomesin choosing formulary drugs, while others lookmore at clinical comparability, bioequivalency and cost. (8)", "Formularies allow card providers to contain the cost of prescription drugs primarily through manufacturer rebates and retail pharmacy discounts. Drugmanufacturers give rebates to the card providers to increase market share and/or utilization. If a manufacturer'sproducts are included in the formulary, themanufacturer expects the use of its drugs to increase. The amount of the rebate offered by a manufacturer to asponsor varies by plan. These rebates varysignificantly across the industry, and there is no reliable data to suggest the size of such rebates. The rebateseffectively lower the net prices that the benefitsponsor must pay for the prescription drugs its members use. Retail pharmacies provide discounts in order to gainaccess to card plan members. ", "In addition to retail pharmacy discounts, many card programs offer mail order services to their members. Mail order pharmacies operate at lower costs thantraditional retail pharmacies and tend to be less expensive for the card sponsor. Some card sponsors encourage theirmembers to use the mail order pharmacy byoffering lower prices through the mail order service than are available at retail pharmacies. ", "Some card sponsors perform drug utilization review (DUR) to evaluate whether a patient was prescribed the proper dosage, whether the patient is getting theappropriate dosage, or if prescriptions are being refilled too frequently. DUR also screens prescriptions for drugsthat may be inappropriate for the patient, fordangerous drug interactions, for duplicate prescriptions, for the overuse of controlled substances, and for fraud andabuse. Actions resulting from incidentsuncovered through DUR may result in the card sponsor sending educational material to the physician or pharmacist,or in dropping coverage for the patient.

(31)", "CMS has said that the market has shown that discount cards can obtain manufacturer rebates, but that these programs do not always pass the rebate back to theconsumer. The Administration believes that because the Medicare-endorsed card initiative would require that cardsponsors pass the rebate to the pharmacy andthe consumer, Medicare beneficiaries could obtain larger discounts than those in currently available card programs. Because the membership in theMedicare-endorsed programs would consist entirely of seniors and some disabled persons, it seems likely that theMedicare card program could provide cardsponsors with some market leverage in negotiating discounts with the drug manufacturers on the most commonlyprescribed senior drugs. However, noinformation is publicly available on the amount of the proposed discounts or rebates, nor on the amount of therebates that would be passed on to Medicarebeneficiaries. ", "Second, the Administration believes that the comparative price information feature of the Medicare-endorsed card proposal would benefit seniors in that theywould have access to comparative price, formulary, and pharmacy network information on the various cardprograms and choose the best plan for their needs. Discount program participants would be able to switch from one card program to another at 6-month intervals,although this could result in additional one-timeper plan enrollment fees of up to $25. ", "The informational feature is potentially one of the most valuable features of the President's discount program, because it would provide a single source ofinformation on drug prices, formularies, and pharmacy networks of all Medicare-endorsed discount card programs. Some existing card programs individuallyprovide information on prices and formularies, but information on competing programs is not available in one easilyaccessible location. For the many seniorswho do not have access to a computer or the Internet, however, published information would continue to be the mostimportant vehicle for ensuring that programparticipants realize the informational benefits of the program. The success of this aspect of the program woulddepend on the final details of the individual cardprograms and how well the companies manage the consortium and provide customer service for easy access to priceand pharmacy network information.", "The publication of drug price information could eventually put pressure on pharmaceutical manufacturers, pharmacies and/or card sponsors to match lower pricesoffered by competitors. Although this could result in additional savings for seniors, the retail pharmacy industrybelieves that pharmacies would face reducedprofit margins if they were pressured to reduce prices without a change in what they pay the wholesalers or drugmanufacturers for the drugs, while the latter twogroups would benefit at the pharmacists' expense. Although the final rule requires that a portion of thepharmaceutical rebates or discounts be provided tobeneficiaries either directly or indirectly through pharmacies, the pharmacies argue that the rule does not specifythe amount of the discount that should go topharmacies. ", "Another factor to consider is whether the card sponsor plans under the proposed Medicare program include drug utilization review (DUR) to determine whetherpatients are using therapeutically equivalent drugs. Patients sometimes use drugs prescribed by different doctorsto treat the same condition and are not aware ofit. DUR may prevent the duplicative use of drugs that fall within the same therapeutic category, thereby enhancingpatient safety while lowering prescription drugcosts. DUR can also identify harmful drug interactions that may occur when a patient with more than one medicalcondition treats those conditions with drugsthat, when taken together, are harmful. ", "The third item mentioned by CMS is that the Medicare drug card initiative would require card sponsors to offer broad access to retail pharmacies, and only offermail-order services as an option. Some existing drug card programs offer only mail-order services, and do notinclude a retail pharmacy network in their plan. The Medicare initiative would not endorse these types of plans. Pharmacy associations assert that, while mail-ordercard programs may provide lower prescriptiondrugs prices, these programs do not provide seniors with the personal help they may need from communitypharmacists. Pharmacy associations have also arguedthat the Medicare drug card initiative could be an incentive for Medicare beneficiaries to shift their prescription drugpurchases from retail pharmacies tomail-order services, and that this would come at a cost to retail pharmacies. CMS has stated that the networkpharmacy requirement in the Medicare drug cardproposal would ensure that Medicare beneficiaries continue to purchase their drugs from retail pharmacies. ", "The final point mentioned by CMS is that Medicare-endorsed card sponsors would be expected to provide clearand reliable educational information services toMedicare beneficiaries such as pharmacy counseling, generic substitution, and DUR programs to monitor andprevent drug-drug interactions. CMS believes thatthis feature would assist seniors and people with disabilities select a quality discount card program. (32) As mentioned earlier, the informational aspects of theMedicare initiative could be valuable in helping seniors lower their drug costs by choosing the card program mostappropriate for their needs. Much, however,would depend on the quality of service that card sponsors provide. Because the drug discount card initiative isintended only for Medicare beneficiaries, featuresof the program such as customer service, marketing material, and included drugs would be geared toward Medicarebeneficiaries. The card program, it is argued,could result in more coordination among companies offering card discount programs and CMS, which couldimprove the service and information seniors receivewhen shopping for their prescription drugs. A consortium of card sponsors could lead to an improvement ofmarketing materials and drug price information forseniors. However, because details of the card programs that would be proposed are not known at this time, it isdifficult to assess how much of an improvementthere would be over existing drug card programs.

They say that the card programs do not reduce the prices that pharmacies pay formedications and claim that providing discountswill disproportionately reduce net profits of pharmacies vis a vis card sponsors and drug manufactures.

However, pharmacies remainconcerned that the revised initiative would harm their profits because, although the card initiative requires cardsponsors to pass discounts to beneficiaries, it doesnot stipulate how much of those savings should be given to seniors.

The remaining 22percent represents gross margins, and after accounting for operating expenses, results in a net profit of only 2percent.

The declaration byStephen Schondelmeyer, Ph.D., Director of theUniversity of Minnesota's PRIME Institute states that pharmacies will lose almost $2 billion in revenues as a resultof the discount card program and that 2,500 to10,000 community pharmacies will cease to operate within three years if the card program is implemented. According to Schondelmeyer's declaration, the cardprogram would encourage the use of mail order pharmacies which would steer card users away from retailpharmacies. Schondelmeyer also states that the carddiscounts would reduce profit margins for pharmacies. (41)", "Although drugstores' profit margins on prescription drug sales may decrease as a result of discount cards, some analysts believe that overall net profits mayincrease due to larger volumes of prescription drugs sold and higher sales in non-pharmaceutical items. While theprofit margins of drug stores have fallenconsiderably since the 1970s, recent data suggests that this trend may change in coming years as prescription drugsales increase. A recent Standard and Poor's(S&P) Industry Survey (42) reported that drugstores' grossprofit margins were expected to fall again in 2001, as they had in 2000 and 1999, due to increases inprescription drug sales to third-party plans.

The number of prescriptions dispensedby traditional drugstore chains increased 7.1% in 2000, while that of independent drugstores increased by 0.3%.

(44) In the larger chains,such as CVS and Walgreens, net income increased an average of 19.5%. Although grossmargins have been falling in recent years, the S&P report indicated that these are expected to improve in thelong term as drugstore chains negotiate betteragreements with third-party payers, and decline to renew plans that are marginally profitable.

In the 108th Congress,Representative Mark Foley introduced a bill ( H.R. 513 ) inthe House on January 31, 2003 to authorize the Secretary of HHS to endorse prescription drug discount cards foruse by medicare beneficiaries.

According to a report prepared by PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP for the Health CareFinancing Administration, \"PBMs managethe drug benefits of approximately 70% of the United States, including approximately 65% of our country'sseniors.\" (46) In the debate over the Administration'sdrug discount card plan, the central role of PBMs has clearly emerged as an issue, especially for the retail pharmacysector. The issues that retail pharmacies haveraised with PBMs go well beyond President Bush's Medicare discount card proposal. In fact, the 2001 Drug Topics'Redbook characterized the relationship asfollows: ", " (47)", "For Congressional critics, discount cards are not seen as a solution to high costs of prescription drugs foruninsured or partially insured seniors. They point to theexistence of numerous discount programs and argue that even with plans that possibly deliver a 10% to 25%discount, the problem of high drug prices remains aserious one. The prices of pharmaceutical products charged by pharmaceutical manufacturers have been identifiedby some Members of Congress as a specialproblem requiring congressional action. The complexity of drug pricing procedures makes it difficult to understandhow the system operates, let alone devisepolicies that make it possible to deliver prescription drugs to seniors at prices comparable to those paid by clientsof third-party purchasers (PBMs) and theirsponsors (employers, insurers, HMOs, and drug discount card sponsors). If the President's revised discount programproposal manages to resolve the issues raisedby the pharmacy industry, Members of Congress may still raise concerns about whether seniors will get prescriptionmedications at affordable prices. ", "Discount drug programs may provide additional discounts to seniors, although it is possible that many of the covered drugs would still remain expensive for low-and middle-income seniors who do not have health insurance that covers prescription drugs. Nevertheless, thereis anecdotal evidence that suggests thatconsumers who are willing to comparison shop on the Internet for prescription drugs can, in some cases, match orbeat discount card prices. The difficulty that theAdministration and Congress face in developing a senior drug benefit will be to develop a policy that deliversnecessary medications to seniors, while providingpharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesalers, PBMs, and pharmacists with incentives to continue to participate inthe marketplace. ", "In summary, a Medicare-endorsed discount card program might provide some savings on prescription drugs for seniors, although the net overall effects are notclear because of the lack of details on the individual card programs. The broad effect on the senior population woulddepend on the size of the discounts and theformularies that the plans offer. The size of the discounts would depend on whether the card program would providesufficient market leverage for card sponsorsto negotiate higher manufacturer rebates from drug manufacturers. Seniors could benefit from certain features ofthe discount card program, such as more accessto information on drug prices and formularies offered by the different plans. This information could enhanceseniors' abilities to comparison shop and savemoney by choosing the plan that would best fit their needs. President Bush's revised proposal could offer seniorssome savings on medications, depending on thefinal details of the various card plans. As noted earlier in this report, critics of the Bush plan believe that theMedicare-endorsed discount cards would not bringadditional benefits for seniors. They have argued that the benefit is very minimal and duplicates a service (discountcards) that the marketplace alreadyprovides.

The overall effect on pharmacies would likely depend on the potential agreementsthey reach with the card sponsors andwhether the card sponsors pass a portion of the drug manufacturer rebates to the pharmacies.

The effect on pharmacies would alsodepend on the response of seniors to the card program and whether they would continue shopping at retailpharmacies for their prescription drug purchases or usemore mail-order options to save money. While seniors and others who must get a prescription filled quickly willcontinue to patronize their local pharmacies,deeper discounting by PBM-owned or operated mail order pharmacies could lead to behavioral changes among thoseseniors who have an ongoing need forprescription drugs to treat chronic conditions."], "subsections": []}]}}
