In the past, legislation to extend some of these expiring provisions has often been referred to as the \"tax extender\" package. While there is no formal definition of a \"tax extender,\" the term has regularly been used to refer to the package of expiring tax provisions temporarily extended by Congress. Often, these expiring provisions are temporarily extended for a short period of time (e.g., one or two years). Over time, as new temporary provisions were routinely extended and hence added to this package, the number of provisions that might be considered \"tax extenders\" grew. This trend was broken with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 ( P.L. 114-113 ), which made permanent a number of provisions that had been part of previous \"tax extender\" packages. As a result, there were fewer \"tax extender\" provisions that expired in 2016 than in previous years.

Enacting provisions on a temporary basis, in theory, would provide Congress with an opportunity to evaluate provisions before providing further extension. Temporary tax provisions may also be used to provide relief during times of economic weakness or following a natural disaster. Congress may also choose to enact temporary provisions for budgetary reasons. Examining the reason why a certain provision is temporary rather than permanent may be part of evaluating whether a provision should be extended."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Reasons for Temporary Tax Provisions", "paragraphs": ["There are several reasons why Congress may choose to enact tax provisions on a temporary basis. As previously noted, enacting provisions on a temporary basis may provide an opportunity to evaluate effectiveness before expiration or extension. However, this rationale is undermined if expiring provisions are regularly extended without systematic review, as is the case in practice. In 2012 testimony before the Senate Committee on Finance, Dr. Rosanne Altshuler noted that", "an expiration date can be seen as a mechanism to force policymakers to consider the costs and benefits of the special tax treatment and possible changes to increase the effectiveness of the policy. This reasoning is compelling in theory, but has been an absolute failure in practice as no real systematic review ever occurs. Instead of subjecting each provision to careful analysis of whether its benefits outweigh its costs, the extenders are traditionally considered and passed in their entirety as a package of unrelated temporary tax benefits.", "While most expiring tax provisions have been extended in recent years, there have been some exceptions. For example, tax incentives for alcohol fuels (e.g., ethanol), which can be traced to policies first enacted in 1978, were not extended beyond 2011. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) had previously found that with the renewable fuel standard (RFS) mandate, tax credits for ethanol were duplicative and did not increase consumption. Congress may choose not to extend certain provisions if an evaluation determines that the benefits provided by the provision do not exceed the cost (in terms of forgone tax revenue).", "In recent years, some \"tax extender\" packages have included all (or nearly all) expiring provisions, while other packages have left some out, effectively allowing provisions to expire as scheduled. The \"tax extender\" package in the American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA; P.L. 112-240 ) did not include several provisions that had been extended multiple times in the past. Most, but not all, expiring provisions were extended in the one-year, retroactive, \"tax extender\" bill enacted at the end of 2014, the Tax Increase Prevention Act ( P.L. 113-295 ). The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (PATH Act), enacted as Division Q of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 ( P.L. 114-113 ), extended all expiring provisions. Unlike other recent extenders packages, the PATH Act included a permanent extension for many provisions. Other provisions were extended for five years, while most provisions were extended for two years, in more typical \"tax extenders\" practice. The most recent \"tax extender\" package, included in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 ( P.L. 115-123 ), retroactively extended tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2016 through the end of 2017.", "Tax policy may also be used to address temporary circumstances in the form of economic stimulus or disaster relief. Economic stimulus measures might include bonus depreciation or generous expensing allowances. Disaster relief policies might include enhanced casualty loss deductions or additional net operating loss carrybacks. Other recent examples of temporary provisions that have been enacted to address special economic circumstances include the exclusion of forgiven mortgage debt from taxable income during the housing crisis of the late 2000s, the payroll tax cut, and the grants in lieu of tax credits to compensate for weak tax-equity markets during the economic downturn (the Section 1603 grants). It has been argued that provisions that were enacted to address a temporary situation should be allowed to expire once the situation is resolved. ", "Congress may also choose to enact tax policies on a temporary basis for budgetary reasons. If policymakers decide that legislation that reduces revenues must be paid for, it is easier to find resources to offset short-term extensions rather than long-term or permanent extensions. Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) assumes, under the current law baseline, that temporary tax cuts expire as scheduled. Thus, the current law baseline does not assume that temporary tax provisions are regularly extended. Hence, if temporary expiring tax provisions are routinely extended in practice, the CBO current law baseline would tend to overstate projected revenues, making the long-term revenue outlook stronger. In other words, by making tax provisions temporary rather than permanent, these provisions have a smaller effect on the long-term fiscal outlook.

Extenders influence how economic actors behave and how the economy's resources are employed. Like all tax benefits, extenders can be evaluated by looking at the impact on economic efficiency, equity, and simplicity. Temporary tax provisions may be efficient and effective in accomplishing their intended purpose, though not equitable. Alternatively, an extender may be equitable but not efficient. Policymakers may have to choose the economic objectives that matter most. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Economic Efficiency", "paragraphs": ["Extenders often provide subsidies to encourage more of an activity than would otherwise be undertaken. According to economic theory, in most cases an economy best satisfies the wants and needs of its participants if markets allocate resources free of distortions from taxes and other factors. Market failures, however, may occur in some instances, and economic efficiency may actually be improved by tax distortions. Thus, the ability of extenders to improve economic welfare depends in part on whether or not the extender is remedying a market failure. According to theory, a \"tax extender\" reduces economic efficiency if it is not addressing a specific market failure.", "An extender is also considered relatively effective if it stimulates the desired activity better than a direct subsidy. Direct spending programs, however, can often be more successful at targeting resources than indirect subsidies made through the tax system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Equity", "paragraphs": ["A tax is considered to be fair when it contributes to a socially desirable distribution of the tax burden. Tax benefits such as the extenders can result in individuals or businesses with similar incomes and expenses paying differing amounts of tax, depending on whether they engage in tax-subsidized activities. This differential treatment is a deviation from the standard of horizontal equity, which requires that people in equal positions be treated equally.", "Another component of fairness in taxation is vertical equity, which requires that tax burdens be distributed fairly among people with different abilities to pay. Extenders may be considered inequitable to the extent that they benefit those who have a greater ability to pay taxes. Those individuals with relatively less income and thus a reduced ability to pay taxes may not have the same opportunity to benefit from extenders as those with higher income. The disproportionate benefit of tax expenditures to individuals with higher incomes reduces the progressivity of the tax system, which is often viewed as a reduction in equity.", "An example of the effect a tax benefit can have on vertical equity can be illustrated by considering two students claiming the above-the-line deduction for higher education expenses. Assume both students are single and have $1,000 in qualifying expenses. If one student has an income of $30,000, and the other student has an income of $60,000, the students would be in different tax brackets. The student with the lower income may fall in the 12% tax bracket, meaning the maximum value of the deduction would be $120 ($1,000 multiplied by 12%). The student with the higher income may fall in the 22% tax bracket, meaning the maximum value of the deduction would be $220 ($1,000 multiplied by 22%).

Cost recovery provisions include accelerated depreciation for business property on Indian reservations; seven-year recovery for motorsport racing facilities; expensing of mine-safety equipment; special expensing rules for film, television, and live theatrical production; and three-year depreciation for race horses two years or younger. For provisions that temporarily accelerate cost recovery, the cost over the 10-year budget window is often smaller than the cost in the first year. This is because some of the cost is recovered, as the accelerated cost recovery serves to defer tax liability to a later time. Some of the cost recovery provisions may interact with \"bonus depreciation\" that was enacted as part of the 2017 tax revision ( P.L. 115-97 ). If property is eligible for bonus depreciation, and therefore does not claim the special cost recovery allowance, the cost of that provision falls.
