Title III (Emergency Assistance for the Redevelopment of Abandoned and Foreclosed Homes) of HERA authorized the creation of the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP-1). Using the administrative framework of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, a total of $3.92 billion was allocated to 307 recipients, including all 50 states, Puerto Rico, insular areas, and qualifying local governments. Funds were awarded by formula based on a state or locality's concentrations of foreclosed homes, subprime mortgage loans, and delinquent home mortgages.", "Since the passage of HERA, Congress has appropriated an additional $3 billion in NSP funds to assist state and local governments to acquire, rehabilitate, and resell the growing inventory of abandoned and foreclosed residential properties resulting from the home mortgage crisis. In 2009, Congress appropriated $2 billion for NSP-2 activities when it passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), P.L. 111-5. ARRA revised key elements of the program as a result of a number of issues raised during the early implementation of NSP-1. Funds appropriated under ARRA for NSP-2 were awarded competitively and included non-profit and for-profit entities as direct recipients of funds when teamed with a state or local government. In 2010, Congress appropriated $1 billion for NSP-3 under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Wall Street Reform Act), P.L. 111-203. The Wall Street Reform Act also used a formula to award funds to states and qualifying local governments with high concentrations of foreclosed homes, subprime mortgages, and delinquent or defaulted residential mortgages.", "Legislation appropriating funds for each of the three rounds included specific deadlines for the obligation and expenditure of funds. Under NSP-1, grantees were required to obligate funds within 18 months from the date HUD signed their grant agreements and to expend their allocations within four years of the allocation date. NSP-2 recipients are required to spend at least 50% of their grant awards within two years of the date funds were allocated, and 100% within three years of the date funds were allocated. Although the Wall Street Reform Act did not include a deadline identifying when funds were to be obligated, it did require that 50% of a recipient's allocation must be expended within two years, and 100% within three years.", "On March 1, 2011, Representative Gary Miller introduced the Neighborhood Stabilization Termination Act, H.R. 861, which would rescind the $1 billion in NSP-3 funds appropriated under the Wall Street Reform Act. On March 2, 2011, the House Financial Services Committee's Subcommittee on Insurance, Housing, and Community Opportunity conducted a hearing on NSP and three federal foreclosure mitigation programs. On March 9, 2011, the House Financial Services Committee considered, marked up, and ordered reported H.R. 861. During the markup the committee approved by voice vote an amendment requiring HUD to publish a notice of termination of the NSP program on its website.

On October 6, 2008, HUD published in the Federal Register a notice on the allocation of NSP funds including information on the formula developed by HUD to distribute funds. HUD's weighted two-tiered formula used several sources to calculate state and local government allocations.", "HUD first distributed the $3.92 billion in total appropriations to the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories, by assigning weights to the factors used in the formula. A total of nine factors were used to calculate each state's allocations, including (1) foreclosure starts in the last six quarters in the state and nation; (2) state and national foreclosure rates per household; (3) state and national subprime loans; (4) state and national subprime rate; (5) loans in default in the state and nation; (6) loan default rate in the state and nation; (7) loans 60 to 89 days delinquent in the state and nation; (8) rate of loans 60 to 89 days delinquent in the state or nation; and (9) state and national vacancy rate in census tracts with more than 40% of the loans that are subprime or high-cost loans. Each of these nine variables received the following weights outlined below. It is important to note that the number and the rate of each of the variables was used in the formula. The statewide allocations were calculated using the formula presented in Figure 1 .", "Each state's allocation was further distributed to local governments using the second tier of the two-step allocation process. The second formula allocated funds based on a community's relative share of foreclosures and abandoned homes in the state. Each jurisdiction's allocation was calculated as shown in Figure 2 .", "Communities that received a minimum allocation of $2 million based on the formula outlined in Figure 2 were allowed to directly administer their share of the state's NSP allocation, whereas all other CDBG entitlement communities not meeting this threshold were directed to request funds from the state.

The discounted value should be significant enough to ensure that when the home is sold by the state or local government the purchaser (homebuyer) will pay below market value for the home or residential property. Further, when a foreclosed home or property is to be purchased as a primary residence by an eligible homebuyer, the act limits the price for which a state and local government may resell such property.
