Some Members of Congress viewed the trust fund as primarily a capital account that would fund the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airport and airway (mostly air traffic control) capital requirements. Others, including the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), some executive agencies, as well as some members of congressional appropriations and budget committees, viewed the trust fund as the basis for a user-pay system that would also fund some or all of the FAA's operations expenses.", "Since 1976, Congress has passed and amended a series of legislative provisions designed to \"guarantee\" the full funding of the FAA's capital programs\u2014the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) and Facilities and Equipment program (F&E). From FY1977 through FY1990, the guarantees consisted of a variety of \"cap and penalty\" provisions which set a legislated cap on the amount of aviation trust fund money that could be used to fund FAA operations. In addition, penalty mechanisms were put in place that would reduce the cap by formula amounts in proportion to the capital programs' shortfall of appropriated funding from their authorized amounts. Although the cap and penalty provisions had some apparent early success, there was growing resistance to passing appropriations bills that adhered to the penalties during the 1980s. In 1990, Congress removed the penalty. Some form of cap continued through 1998.", "In 2000, the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (P.L. 106-181; AIR21) included two new spending guarantees. One made it \"out-of-order\" in the House or Senate to consider legislation that failed to use all trust fund receipts and interest annually. The second made it out-of-order to consider any bills that provided any funding for research or operations if it failed to fully fund AIP and F&E at their authorized levels. These guarantees were extended through FY2007 in Vision 100-Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act (P.L. 108-176; Vision 100). AIP has been nearly fully funded under these provisions. F&E has not during recent years.", "Both the cap and penalty, and the point of order enforced guarantees have had mixed success. The success depends on the support that enforcing the mechanism has maintained during the appropriations process. The history of these guarantees indicates that the broader budgetary situation can trump the spending guarantees.", "Aviation funding guarantees have received consideration during the FAA reauthorization debate of the 110th Congress. Options discussed during the debate have included retaining the current system, modifying the current guarantees, resurrecting a mechanism analogous to the cap and penalty provisions, reconsidering taking the trust fund \"off-budget,\" or erecting budgetary \"fire walls\" as was done for the highway and transit programs in 1998."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Since the 1971 creation of the user-supported airport and airway trust fund under provisions of the Airport and Airway Development and Revenue Acts of 1970 (P.L. 91-259; the 1970 Act) there has been disagreement over the appropriate use of the trust fund's revenues. The disagreement centered on differing views of whether the trust fund's primary purpose was to fund airport and airway (mostly air traffic control) infrastructure and those who viewed the trust fund as a user pay mechanism that should be available to also fund part or all of FAA operations (mostly salaries) and maintenance activities. This led, beginning in 1976, to the enactment of a series of legislative mechanisms (commonly referred to as \"cap and penalty\" provisions or \"out of order\" provisions) designed to assure that federal capital spending for U.S. airports and airways would be funded at their fully authorized levels. Some supporters also hoped that these provisions would also assure a significant general fund share for the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) operating budget. Such funding guarantee proposals have been part of every FAA reauthorization debate since 1976.", "This report begins with a background discussion of the establishment of the Airport and Airway Trust fund (hereafter referred to as the trust fund) and the spending policy conflict that arose from different views concerning the legitimate use of the trust fund revenue during both the debate over the creation of the trust fund and the first years of its existence. It then examines the 22-year era when Congress imposed a variety of \"cap and penalty\" provisions on aviation trust fund spending in an effort to both encourage full funding of the FAA's capital programs spending as well as assuring a significant general fund share to support the FAA's operations. The report then briefly examines the current spending guarantees that succeeded the cap and penalty provisions following passage of the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21 st Century (AIR21; P.L. 106-181 ) in March 2000, and that were continued through FY2007 by Vision 100\u2014Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act ( P.L. 108-176 ). Finally, the report discusses a variety of spending guarantee options which may be discussed during the upcoming FAA reauthorization debate.", "This report's analysis necessarily assumes the spending levels and program structure of the times. There is an alternative view that too much is spent on the FAA, which is not discussed in detail in this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The FAA budget is divided into four categories. Two of the categories, the grants-in-aid for Airports category (basically the Airport Improvement Program (AIP)) and the Facilities and Equipment (F&E) category are considered \"capital\" accounts or programs because they deal with the development of airport and airway infrastructure. The AIP is a program of capital grant-in-aid for airport development projects such as runways and taxiways, but it also funds noise mitigation and other airport projects. F&E, which is also a capital program, pays for the equipping, housing (such as airport towers), and modernizing of the air traffic control system. The two noncapital categories include Research, Engineering and Development (RE&D) and Operations and Maintenance (O&M). The RE&D category funds research in support of the AIP and F&E programs as well as safety research. The O&M account pays the salaries of all FAA employees (aviation related) and also funds some maintenance, safety, and administrative activities.", "The issue of who should pay for the programs and activities of the FAA predates the creation of the aviation trust fund in 1971 by the Airport and Airway Development and Revenue Acts of 1970. Previously, the FAA's budget had been paid for out of the U.S. Treasury's general fund which is supported by general taxpayer revenues. No dedicated tax revenues were used to fund aviation use prior to implementation of the 1970 Act. The act authorized taxes on aviation users and dedicated their use to aviation purposes by crediting all these tax revenues to the aviation trust fund. Conflicts emerged immediately between those who viewed the aviation trust fund as a capital-only source of funding versus those who viewed it more as the basis of a full user-pay mechanism for all FAA funding. Studies by both the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the General Accounting Office (GAO; now the Government Accountability Office) have concluded that the 1970 Act was intended to provide that the aviation trust fund would finance airport and airway capital needs and that remaining funds could then be used for the operating costs of the airway system (mostly for air traffic control operations) as well. The issue of the appropriate general fund share of the FAA budget has long been one of the most contentious issues during the reauthorization debates. The general fund share within the context of aviation policy is to cover costs to the aviation system of government use (mostly military use) and the benefits of the system to nonusers. Aviation user groups have historically supported a larger general fund share than has the FAA, the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the congressional budget and appropriations committees who often view, at least part of the general fund contribution as an unwarranted and/or unnecessary subsidization of civil aviation users by the general taxpayer.", "The Nixon Administration's FAA budget requests for FY1971 and FY1972 under the new trust fund system brought it into immediate conflict with Congress over the budgetary treatment of trust fund revenues. The Administration treated the new financing system as a user-pay system to fund all or nearly all of the FAA budget, whereas many Members of Congress viewed the trust fund as primarily a user-supported capital fund (although spending on FAA operations was allowable). Adding to the controversy, the Administration's first budget submissions of the trust fund era (the proposed FY1971 supplemental and the President's FY1972 budget proposal) proposed funding both airport and airway facilities at well below the minimum authorized amounts of $280 million for airport grants and $250 million for airway facilities. For FY1972, the budget proposed that the remaining trust fund balance be used to pay for FAA administration and operations costs. This would, however, have provided more trust fund financing, $700 million, for operations than for airport grants and airway facilities combined. Many in Congress saw this holding-down of FAA capital spending to free up trust fund resources for FAA operations costs as a violation of the intent and spirit of the 1970 Act."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A Note on the Unified Congressional Budget and the Aviation Trust Fund", "paragraphs": ["The adoption of the 1970 Act followed closely on the heels of the 1969 congressional adoption of the unified budget concept, a change that would have ongoing influence on both the budgetary treatment of trust fund revenues and the operation of subsequent spending guarantees that rely on trust fund resources. Under the unified budget concept, all trust fund receipts and expenditures were made part of the annual federal budget. Consequently, trust fund amounts, collected and spent, influence the overall budget deficit or surplus totals. This, in turn, can have an impact on the budgetary treatment of trust fund-supported programs and activities. Although the inclusion of the aviation trust fund within the unified budget was not a major issue during debate over the trust fund's creation, the unified budget has, historically, had an impact on trust fund spending levels. Within the context of the unified budget, an excess of aviation trust fund revenues over expenditures can be seen as an offset in federal deficit computations. In some cases, however, the balance may be seen as having been spent on non-aviation programs or purposes. Because the balance is invested in short-term Treasury notes (the interest is payed to the aviation trust fund), the federal government is lending itself an amount roughly equal to the balance. This, in effect, frees up the money for spending elsewhere in the budget without pushing up the overall budget deficit or putting pressure on budgetary ceilings established by the congressional budget process. During the history of the aviation trust fund, concerns have been raised that this situation creates an incentive, for those whose priorities for non-aviation spending (or for deficit reduction) are higher than for aviation spending, to hold-down federal aviation trust-fund-supported spending on aviation. This situation, where the trust fund's unexpended balance (at times, somewhat inaccurately referred to as a surplus) is allowed to grow and is not spent on federal aviation programs and activities, has been opposed by much of the aviation community and by the transportation authorizing committees. The unexpended balance has also been a factor cited in attempts, since the creation of the trust fund, to legislate mechanisms that would encourage full funding of the FAA's capital budgets and assure that the aviation trust fund revenues are spent for aviation purposes only."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Airport and Airway Development and Revenue Acts Amendments of 1971 (P.L. 92-174)", "paragraphs": ["Although the Nixon Administration quickly agreed to increase airport grants for FY1972 to the $280 million minimum, and expressed the intent to meet the minimum spending goals for both airport grants and airways facilities over the 10-year life of the trust fund's tax provisions, Congress passed the Airport and Airway Development and Revenue Acts Amendments of 1971, effectively banning the spending of trust fund money on FAA operations.", "The 1971 amendment was a strong congressional reaction consistent with many Members' perceptions that the Nixon Administration was ignoring the intent of Congress under the 1970 Act. The reaction embodied in the 1971 amendment went beyond merely clarifying Congress's intent and significantly narrowed the allowable use of trust fund revenues. The Amendment made the trust fund a capital-only account (although only temporarily). The 1971 amendment eliminated the user-pay component. Ironically, by reinforcing the congressional intent that the trust fund be used primarily as a capital account, the 1971 amendment eliminated the secondary intent that private sector users, through taxes imposed under the 1970 Act, would help pay for the federal services they benefitted from (once capital needs of the airport and airway systems were met). The change, by making all noncapital components of the FAA's budget dependent on general fund revenues, left the FAA more exposed to the fiscal pressures that emerged from the constrained general budgetary environment of the period. During FY1973-FY1976 the trust fund-appropriated share of operations was zero. The general fund share of the total FAA appropriations was 56% for FY1973, 81% for FY1974, 83% for FY1975, and 65% for FY1976.

In effect, the caps would have been reduced by the same fraction of Airport Development Aid Program (ADAP) obligation limitation (ObLim) to ADAP authorization. For example, if the ADAP grants ObLim was 3/4 of the ADAP authorization, then the cap on trust fund operations spending would be reduced to 3/4 of the statutory cap for the fiscal year. In the 1979 Act, added a second penalty provision. The provision provided, for FY1980 and FY1981, that any failure to fully obligate F&E funding up to the appropriated level would lead to a reduction of the cap by an amount equal to the dollar shortfall. Supporters of this provision may have hoped this would encourage the FAA to speed up its implementation of the NAS plan.", "During FY1977-FY1981 no penalties were assessed. ADAP's obligation limitations equaled or exceeded its authorizations in FY1977-FY1979 and 1981. The $17 million short fall in FY1980 did not lead to a penalty perhaps because F&E appropriations exceeded the F&E authorization by $43 million, more than making up the difference.", "The cap and penalty regime seems to have had a significant impact on the general fund share of FAA funding. Although the removal of the outright ban on O&M spending of trust fund resources (which were in effect from FY1973 to FY1976) lowered the general fund share of the FAA budget, it remained high under the 1976 Act, averaging 57% during FY1977-FY1981. The general fund share had averaged 71% under the 1971 Act.", "The restriction on trust fund spending for operations in the 1971 Amendments act and the new provisions in the 1976 Act, succeeded in limiting trust fund spending on FAA operations and maintenance (O&M), but appropriations for the capital programs did not rise sufficiently to absorb the excess revenue created by the rising tax revenues dedicated to the trust fund. Over time, the uncommitted aviation trust fund balances continued to grow. On September 30, 1980 when the original aviation trust fund authorization expired, the fund had a projected uncommitted balance of roughly $3.8 billion.", "Disputes over what to do about the aviation trust fund balance, along with continuing disagreements over the valid use of trust fund revenues and whose taxes should support the fund, as well as concerns about deficit spending in general, all had a part in the legislative deadlock that led to the lapsing of the aviation trust fund's authorization on October 1, 1980.

The ratios for the following two years remained the same at 1.28 for FY1986 and 1.34 for FY1987.

This change in the penalty provision appears to have been made for two reasons. First, the cap now already included incentives for higher spending on AIP. Second was the increase in authorizations for F&E (included in Section 506 of the 1982 Act) under the influence of the proposed NAS plan and the growing perception that the airway system needs (mostly for air traffic control) were great. In short, the cap would provide incentives for spending on AIP while the penalty provisions would protect the increased spending on F&E.

According to CBO,", "Primarily because of program constraints, these provisions have merely altered the accounting for aviation spending, forcing the general fund to finance more of these expenditures ... In addition, there still remains an incentive to limit capital spending for aviation programs. Given the annual level of excise tax revenue from aviation, each dollar of aviation spending greater than these tax revenues must be funded by general revenues. Therefore, regardless of the actual accounting for aviation spending, each dollar reduction in spending on aviation either reduces the need for the general fund to finance aviation spending, or produces a trust fund surplus from which the Treasury can borrow to cover non aviation expenditures.", "As mentioned earlier, the uncommitted balance of the trust fund continued to rise during the 1982 Act's authorization cycle, reaching $5.559 billion at the end of FY1987."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Airport and Airway Safety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-223, 101 Stat 1492; 1987 Act)", "paragraphs": ["The 1987 Act extended the excise taxes at existing rates and reauthorized FAA programs for three years.

For example, this was reflected in years when the penalties were only partially imposed, in recognition that the authorization levels for F&E were based on optimistic assumptions. Also, especially in the mid-1990s, attempts to rein in the budget deficit had an impact on the budgetary treatment of trust fund revenues.

Given the annual level of excise tax revenue from aviation, each dollar of aviation spending greater than these tax revenues must be funded by general revenues. Therefore, regardless of the actual accounting for aviation spending, each dollar reduction in spending on aviation either reduces the need for the general fund to finance aviation spending, or produces a trust fund surplus from which the Treasury can borrow to cover non-aviation expenditures.", "In effect, within the context of the unified congressional budget, appropriators and budgeteers were more concerned about the overall size of the budget or deficit than whether below-authorized spending on AIP and F&E caused a squeezing-down of trust fund spending for O&M.

The experience of F&E lends credence to the view that AIP's funding success has more to do with the popularity of the program within Congress and around the country than the guarantees.

The highway trust fund dropped from an FY2001 end-of-year uncommitted balance of $7.3 billion to an estimated balance of $1.9 billion for FY2005. According to GAO, part of this decline was due to overestimates of trust fund revenues. Actual revenues were $383 million less than forecast for FY2001, $2.3 billion less than forecast for FY2002, and $1 billion less than forecast for FY2003 and FY2004. Especially in FY2002, but perhaps also a factor in the later years was the post-911 drop in flying, especially at high fare levels.
