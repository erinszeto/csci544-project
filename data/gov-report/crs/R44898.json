The Basic Grant formula is the original Title I-A formula, and has received appropriations each year since FY1966. The Basic Grant formula is the primary vehicle for providing Title I-A funds: it is the formula under which the largest share of Title I-A funds are allocated (42% of FY2017 appropriations) and under which the largest proportion of LEAs participate. Over time, the Concentration Grant, Targeted Grant, and EFIG formulas have been added to Title I-A to provide additional funds to areas with high numbers or percentages of children from low-income families.

Congress initially accomplished this by allocating Title I-A funds through one formula\u2014Basic Grants. Over time, Congress added three additional formulas that essentially provide supplemental funding to LEAs that serve concentrations of students from low-income families. That is, Congress has tried to target funds to areas with higher concentrations of poverty, first through the Concentration Grant formula, which provided supplemental funds to areas with a high number or percentage of children from low-income families; and later through the Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas, which provide more funding per formula child (i.e., children included in the grant determination process) to LEAs with higher numbers or percentages of children from low-income families.", "Since FY1966, every formula under the program has included some type of population factor and expenditure factor. Over the years, the children included in the determination of the population factor (referred to as formula children) have changed. The expenditure factors have changed as well. Changes in both areas have substantial implications for state and LEA grant amounts. In addition, while continuing to focus on the targeting of Title I-A dollars on areas with the greatest concentrations of poverty, Congress has periodically taken steps to help provide smaller states with additional funding to run Title I-A programs through state minimum grant provisions. Congress has also modified the Title I-A allocation formulas over time to include hold harmless provisions to prevent LEAs from receiving less than a certain amount of funding from year-to-year, provided appropriations are sufficient to make hold harmless payments. The inclusion of state minimum grant and hold harmless provisions does not necessarily further the overarching goal of targeting Title I-A funds on areas with concentrations of poverty, but it does allow Congress to address other issues that are considered important to many locales. ", "This section of the report provides a synthesis of themes identified through a CRS review of historical materials. A more in-depth depiction of the materials reviewed and of the formula-related amendments to the ESEA is provided in the following section, \"Historical Overview of the Title I-A Formulas.\""], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Measuring Poverty and Identifying Formula Children", "paragraphs": ["Throughout the history of the Title I-A program, its focus has remained on providing funds to areas with concentrations of poverty. Thus, Congress has needed to identify which children should be considered children living in poor or low-income families. This has required determining a definition of poverty, identifying a data source to use to measure poverty, and deciding which \"other\" categories of children, if any, should be included in the determination of Title I-A grants. These choices all have implications for state and LEA grant amounts. ", "During initial consideration of the ESEA, there was debate about whether to rely solely on the 1960 Decennial Census data or also include children in certain families receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) in grant determinations. Ultimately, Congress decided to include both children identified as low-income via the Census data and children in families receiving AFDC in the determination of grant amounts. One year later, Congress expanded the formula child eligibility criteria to include neglected, delinquent, and foster children and increased the threshold at which a child would be considered living in a poor family. While these changes increased the number of formula children, they also raised concerns about the potential increase in the cost of the program. Over the next several decades, debates over the structure of the formula child count continued as Congress changed the poverty threshold, changed when new poverty thresholds could be applied, altered when new Decennial Census data could be applied, and used data in addition to the Census data in determining counts. ", "While the data issues and debate over measures of poverty have diminished over time, particularly with the use of LEA-level estimates of poverty from the Census Bureau's Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) data in 1999, issues related to which areas may be favored by a particular formula child definition have not. More specifically, there has been an ongoing debate about whether the Title I-A formulas are more favorable to more or less densely populated areas. For example, changes made to the count of AFDC children used in the determination of the number of formula children in the 1970s was a direct response to this debate when the counts were initially viewed as favoring urban areas (resulting in two-thirds of the actual number of AFDC children being counted) and then subsequently viewed as being unfavorable to urban areas (resulting in a full count of AFDC children). ", "In addition to the debate about which data to use to construct poverty measures, a debate over the relative emphasis that should be placed on the percentage versus the count of formula children in an LEA has persisted and continues under the current formulas. Under current law, two formula child weighting scales are used in the determination of grants under the Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas: one based on formula child rates (determined by dividing an LEA's number of formula children by the number of children ages 5-17 residing in the LEA), the other based on formula child counts. Higher weights are applied to the LEAs with the highest formula child rates than are applied to the LEAs with the highest formula child counts. As intended, these weighting schemes result in LEAs that have a high formula child count, a high formula child rate, or both receiving more funding per formula child. Based on the statutorily specified weights used in determining weighted child counts, the weighting process would appear to favor LEAs with higher formula child rates (often rural LEAs) over LEAs with higher numbers of formula children (typically urban LEAs). However, due in part to the way the weights are applied, LEAs with high numbers of formula children often receive more funding per formula child than LEAs with a high formula child rate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Expenditures on Public Education: High Spending States Versus Low Spending States", "paragraphs": ["Every Title I-A formula includes a factor that accounts for how much money states spend on public K-12 education. This expenditure factor has consistently been based on state average per pupil expenditures (APPE) or national APPE since the initial enactment of the ESEA. When initially debated, proponents of the inclusion of an expenditure factor argued that the factor was needed to compensate states where the cost of educating a child was higher. The expenditure factor was also intended to compensate states with a higher cost of living. Opponents argued that the inclusion of an expenditure factor disproportionately benefitted wealthy states and counties. In part, the debate also focused on whether Title I-A funds should be spread broadly across the country or concentrated in the areas of greatest need. It was also a debate that pitted the higher spending states that argued their costs of education and living were higher than those in other states against lower spending states that argued they could not afford to spend more on education and, therefore, needed more Title I-A funding. ", "In the mid-1970s, Congress put bounds on the expenditure factor that increased the expenditure factor used in grant determinations for low-spending states and reduced the expenditure factor used in grant determinations for high-spending states. This change effectively provided a benefit to lower spending states, as it raised their expenditure factor for purposes of grant determinations, and penalized higher spending states, as their expenditure factor could not exceed the upper bound. It did not, however, end the debate regarding if and how to account for spending on public K-12 education in Title I-A formulas.", "In 1994, Congress created two additional Title I-A formulas (Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas) that were intended to target Title I-A funds more effectively on LEAs with concentrations of poverty. When the EFIG formula was initially enacted, it did not include that same expenditure factor that was included in the other three formulas. Rather, the EFIG formula included an effort factor and an equity factor. The effort factor is based on a state's education spending relative to personal income, essentially considering the share of available resources a state is dedicating to public K-12 education. The equity factor is based on variation in education spending among LEAs within a state. The more equitable spending is among LEAs in a given state, the higher a state's grant will be. These factors were included in the formulas due to concerns about disparities in funds and resources among LEAs in many states and to provide an incentive for states to reduce those disparities. ", "The new EFIG formula was enacted in tandem with the new Targeted Grant formula, which included the same expenditure factor that was being used in the determination of Basic Grants and Concentration Grants. However, concerns were raised that the new formulas disadvantaged the southern states (traditionally lower spending states). In addition, prior to funding the Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas in FY2002, the EFIG formula was changed to include an expenditure factor similar to that of the other three formulas. Thus, the EFIG formula incorporates state spending on public K-12 education in three ways (expenditure, equity, and effort factors), while the other three formulas account for it only through an expenditure factor. ", "More recently, during consideration of ESSA in the Senate, a fifth formula was proposed that would have been similar to the EFIG formula in several ways but would have changed the expenditure factor from being based on state APPE to national APPE, essentially eliminating the expenditure factor. Similar to the addition of bounds on the expenditure factor, this change would have assisted states that spend less on public K-12 education as lower spending states would have had their expenditure factor raised to the national APPE, while higher spending states would have had their expenditure factor lowered to the national APPE. The fifth formula ultimately was not included in the bill, but it demonstrated that accounting for state spending on public K-12 education in the Title I-A formulas continues to be a congressional concern.

State minimum grant provisions serve to increase the amount of funding that is provided to small states to operate Title I-A programs. State minimum grant provisions are funded by reducing the amount of funding provided to all the other states in order to support the smaller states. LEA hold harmless provisions prevent LEAs from losing more than a certain percentage of funding from year-to-year, which provides some stability in grant amounts. As with the state minimum grant provision, LEAs that receive grants in excess of their hold harmless amount have their grant amounts reduced to provide other LEAs with a hold harmless grant amount. These provisions have also been included in formulas to mitigate losses to states and LEAs that may result from changes in the Title I-A formula factors. For example, the first hold harmless provision was added to Basic Grants by the 1974 amendments to help offset any losses that could result from changes made to the expenditure factor. Subsequently, when Concentration Grants were added to Title I-A in the 1978 amendments, the Senate Committee on Human Resources added a requirement that no state receive less than 0.25% of the amount appropriated for Concentration Grants to protect the amount of funding received by rural districts.", "By shifting the distribution of funds under the formulas, especially under the Concentration Grant, Targeted Grant, and EFIG formulas, the inclusion of state minimum grant and LEA hold harmless provisions may reduce the targeting of funds on LEAs with higher concentrations of poverty by reducing grant amounts to LEAs that would have otherwise received more funding. That is, state minimum grant provisions and LEA hold harmless provisions disrupt the formula provisions that were enacted to target funds on LEAs with higher concentrations of poverty. At the same time, however, these provisions may serve other purposes valued by Congress, including providing small states with a larger grant than they would have otherwise received to run their Title I-A programs and providing LEAs with stability from year to year. In addition, both types of provisions have been used to gain support for changes to the Title I-A formulas by helping to mitigate any losses that may result from the changes.

As previously discussed, there were issues related to how to count poor and other disadvantaged children and how to factor in state spending on public K-12 education when determining grant amounts. Another issue that has consistently attracted substantial attention is how to target Title I-A funds more effectively on LEAs with concentrations of poverty (either in terms of having a high number or a high percentage of formula children). While there are clearly some concerns about whether having a high number or high percentage of formula children should result in larger LEA grants per formula child, as evidenced by the current urban versus rural LEA debate discussed above, there has also been a more global debate about how best to target Title I-A funds on areas with concentrations of poverty. This debate has played out over several decades through the addition of three formulas to the original Basic Grant formula. ", "The Education Amendments of 1978 ( P.L. 95-561 ) added the Grants to LEAs in Counties with Especially High Concentrations of Children from Low Income Families. These grants are more commonly known as Concentration Grants and were modeled on an earlier Title I-A grant program that essentially had the same purpose. As the title indicates, this formula was added to Title I-A to provide additional funding to areas with high concentrations of children from low-income families. In adding the formula to Title I-A, proponents argued that areas with concentrations of poverty needed \"more intensive remedial effort than the average school district.\" ", "Two additional formulas were added to the ESEA in 1994. The House Committee on Education and Labor added the Targeted Grants formula to target Title I-A funds more effectively on areas with concentrations of poverty, but it retained the Basic Grant and Concentration Grant formulas to continue to provide funding to \"other less poor but still needy communities.\" The Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources took a different approach, arguing that the Basic Grant and Concentration Grant formulas should be replaced by a new formula (EFIG) that would better target funding on concentrations of poverty. Ultimately, both the Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas were added to the ESEA and the Basic Grant and Concentration Grant formulas were retained.

According to House Report 89-143, which accompanied H.R. 2362 (the bill that ultimately became the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965), \"[t]he heart of the problem lies in our elementary and secondary school systems where there are concentrations of America's children of poverty.\" Title I (now referred to as Title I-A) was viewed as another tool to eradicate \"poverty and its effects.\" The committee report stated the following: ", "The major thrust of this legislation is contained in title I where it is proposed that approximately $1.06 billion be provided to local school districts for the purpose of broadening and strengthening public school programs in the schools where there are concentrations of educationally disadvantaged children.

The Concentration Grant formula was added in the 1970s in an attempt to provide additional funding for LEAs with concentrations of poverty. During the consideration of ESEA reauthorization in the early 1990s, the House and the Senate proposed formulas (Targeted Grants and EFIG, respectively) intended to target concentrations of poverty more effectively by providing more funding per child to LEAs with higher numbers or percentages of formula children. As both of these formulas were enacted into law, and the Basic Grant and Concentration Grant formulas were retained, funds are allocated through four formulas under current law. Title I-A has also periodically included a Special Incentive Grant formula, intended to incentivize state and local education spending on elementary and secondary education. This formula was last funded in FY1975.", " Figure 1 shows the years in which each of the formulas was authorized and funded. Additionally, Figure 1 indicates the ESEA reauthorizations that made substantial changes to the Title I-A formulas. In some instances, formulas have been funded every year they have been authorized to receive appropriations, and in years in which the authorization of appropriations has expired (e.g., Basic Grants). In other instances, formulas were not funded until a subsequent reauthorization of the ESEA made substantial changes to the originally enacted formulas (e.g., EFIG).", "As with the original Basic Grant formula, grant amounts under each formula in current law are generally determined by multiplying a \"formula child count,\" consisting primarily of estimated numbers of school-age children in poor families, by an \"expenditure factor\" based on state APPE. After initial grant awards are calculated, grant amounts are reduced to equal the level of available appropriations for each formula, taking into account a variety of state and LEA minimum grant and hold harmless provisions. Initial grant amounts have had to be reduced every year except FY1966 to equal the level of available appropriations. LEAs must also have a minimum number and/or percentage of formula children to be eligible to receive a grant under a specific formula. Grants have always been allocated by ED to LEAs via state educational agencies (SEAs). However, prior to FY1999 sufficient data were not available for ED to calculate grants at the LEA level, so ED calculated grants at the county level and SEAs suballocated county totals to LEAs. LEAs receiving grants subsequently distribute funds to schools, often based on the percentage of children in each school eligible for free or reduced-price lunch.", "This section of the report describes the Title I-A formulas as initially enacted by the ESEA and changes made to the formulas by major ESEA reauthorization bills.

Prior to the enactment of the ESEA, there were two main federal programs for elementary and secondary education: (1) funding under Aid to Federally Impacted Areas (hereinafter referred to as Impact Aid) to offset the impacts that military bases and tax-exempt federal property had on LEAs, and (2) funding under the National Defense Education Act of 1958 (NDEA), which was intended to strengthen math and science education after the launch of the Soviet satellite Sputnik. After World War II, Congress introduced a number of bills to provide general federal aid to schools, but they were all defeated over concerns about aid to private schools, aid to segregated schools, or federal control over K-12 education. ", "The first major step toward the passage of the ESEA came in 1964, when the Civil Rights Act banned federal funding to segregated programs. With respect to elementary and secondary education, this meant that federal funds could not be provided to segregated schools. Thus, the issue of aid to segregated schools was no longer an obstacle to the passage of a federal education bill providing general aid. Soon thereafter, the Johnson Administration came up with a compromise on the private school issue whereby aid would be targeted to children in poor families, regardless of the type of school they attended. The aid would be provided to the public schools, but also be available to benefit both public and private school students. Due to the resolution of the segregation and private school issues, the ESEA passed through Congress relatively quickly.

The Administration justified its use of family income (as opposed to property value per child or per capita income) in the formula because it met four criteria: (1) it identified a distinct poverty group and was broad in its coverage, (2) it applied uniformly among states and local units, (3) gathering and using the data was administratively feasible, and (4) it was convertible into numbers of disadvantaged children at the desirable geographic level of allocation. The expenditure factor was needed, it was argued, to compensate states where the cost of educating a child was higher. The expenditure factor also compensated states with a higher cost of living as \"a $2,000 level of family income in rural Mississippi [was] not the same level of poverty as a $2,000 family income in New York City.\"", "On the other hand, critics of the formula argued that it disproportionally benefitted wealthy states and wealthy counties, and the reliance on \"outdated\" Census data would not reflect changes in local need. Additionally, the inclusion of AFDC data in the formula child counts was seen by some as creating inequity because children in families receiving other benefits, such as disability payments, were not being counted.
