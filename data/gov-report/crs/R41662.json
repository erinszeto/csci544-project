With the national unemployment rate decreasing but still high, the weekly demand for regular and extended unemployment benefits continued at high levels. Congress deliberated multiple times on whether to extend the authorization for several key temporary unemployment insurance provisions. The EUC08 program, along with temporary provisions surrounding EB, had been set to expire at the end of 2012. The signing of H.R. 8 on January 2, 2013, now means that the EUC08 program is scheduled to expire the week ending on or before January 1, 2014. The 100% federal financing of the EB program will expire on December 31, 2013. In addition, the option for states to use three-year EB trigger lookbacks expires the week ending on or before December 31, 2013.", "The 112th Congress faced these expirations as well as likely unemployment insurance policy issues, including unemployment insurance financing.

This results in essentially 53 different programs. Generally, UC eligibility is based on attaining qualified wages and employment in covered work over a 12-month period (called a base period) prior to unemployment. All states require a worker to have earned a certain amount of wages or to have worked for a certain period of time (or both) within the base period to be monetarily eligible to receive any UC benefits. The methods states use to determine monetary eligibility vary greatly. Most state benefit formulas replace approximately half of a claimant's average weekly wage up to a weekly maximum.", "The UC program is financed by federal taxes under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) and by state payroll taxes under the State Unemployment Tax Acts (SUTA). The 0.6% effective net FUTA tax paid by employers on the first $7,000 of each employee's earnings ($42 per worker per year) funds both federal and state administrative costs, loans to insolvent state UC accounts, the federal share (50% under permanent law, 100% temporarily under current law) of EB payments, and state employment services.", "SUTA taxes on employers are limited by federal law to funding regular UC benefits and the state share (50% under permanent law, 0% temporarily under current law) of EB payments. Federal law requires that the state tax be on at least the first $7,000 of each employee's earnings (it may be more) and requires that the maximum state tax rate be at least 5.4%. Federal law also requires the state tax rate to be based on the amount of UC paid to former employees (known as \"experience rating\"). Within these broad requirements, states have great flexibility in determining the SUTA structure of their state. Generally, the more UC benefits paid out to its former employees, the higher the tax rate of the employer, up to a maximum established by state law.
