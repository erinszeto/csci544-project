Regulations under development at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would impose new requirements on fossil-fueled (mostly coal-fired) power plants (CFPPs) to control GHG emissions. The first of these requirements was issued in September 2013 with proposed standards for the control of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from new electric generating units burning fossil fuels. EPA's proposals for control of GHG emissions from existing power plants are expected by June 2014, with many options under consideration. EPA may target emissions on a state or plant-by-plant basis, with companies likely given choices for compliance. Within such a system, efficiency improvements can be an important contributor.", "The overall efficiency of a power plant encompasses the efficiency of the various components of a generating unit. Minimizing heat losses is the greatest factor affecting the loss of CFPP efficiency, and there are many areas of potential heat losses in a power plant. Efficiency of older CFPPs becomes degraded over time, and lower power plant efficiency results in more CO2 being emitted per unit of electricity generated. The options most often considered for increasing the efficiency of CFPPs include equipment refurbishment, plant upgrades, and improved operations and maintenance schedules.", "Cost of the improvements is often compared to the expected return in increased efficiency as a primary determinant of whether to go forward with a program. A study by the Asia-Pacific Working Group (APWG) found that at the low to medium end of cost expenditures are combustion, steam cycle, and operations and maintenance improvements. Replacing the older CFPPs with new power plants was not generally seen as being practical because the expenditure for a new plant could not be justified by the improved performance. Instead, efficiency and operational improvements were seen as a possible alternative considering a range of equipment upgrades and refurbishment options to various CFPP systems.", "The National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) took APWG's analysis a step further, finding that while the average efficiency of U.S. plants was 32% in 2007, the efficiency of the top 10% was five points higher at 37.4%. NETL suggested that if GHG emissions reduction was a goal, then heat rate efficiency improvements could enable a power plant to generate the same amount of electricity from less fuel and decrease CO2 emissions.", "In 2010, NETL completed a new study of U.S. CFPP efficiency, concluding that if generation levels were held constant at 2008 levels, overall fleet efficiency could be raised from 32% to 36%, resulting in an overall reduction in U.S. GHG emissions of 175 million metric tonnes per year, or 2.5% of total U.S. GHG emissions in 2008.", "According to subsequent analyses, NETL concluded that retirements of lower efficiency units combined with increased generation from higher efficiency refurbished units, and advanced refurbishments with improved operation and maintenance, would be necessary to achieve this goal. These improvements would generally be considered low to medium cost upgrades. However, at the higher cost end are major plant retrofits and upgrades (i.e., conversion of subcritical CFPP units to super- or ultra-supercritical CFPP units), which would raise efficiencies more substantially.", "One possible approach to achieve fleet-wide efficiency improvement might be to follow NETL's suggestion of using the top decile of CFPP efficiency as a benchmark for the U.S. fleet, and establish an \"efficiency frontier\" that would be revisited periodically to reset the benchmark. This could be combined with possible incentives to improve efficiency or retire less efficient power plants. Other federal approaches could use tax incentives to encourage greater efficiency, or employ energy efficiency standards focused on improving efficiency of CFPPs. The overall cost of these or other programs to increase CFPP efficiency has yet to be determined."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Coal has long been the major fossil fuel used to produce electricity.

First, in September 2013 EPA proposed standards for the control of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions from new electric generating units burning fossil fuels. EPA has suggested that utilization of carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a viable means for new coal-fired power plants to comply with the proposed standards. But higher efficiency components and processes are unlikely to be sufficient to meet the proposed new plant standards. As requirements for new sources (i.e., new power plants), EPA's proposed standards do not directly apply to existing power plants currently producing electricity. EPA's proposals for control of GHG emissions from existing power plants are expected by June 2014, with many options for reducing GHGs under consideration. EPA may target emissions on a state or plant-by-plant basis, with companies likely given choices for compliance, and increasing coal-fired power plant (CFPP) efficiency may be one of those choices.", "Improving the efficiency of existing coal plants could potentially result in significant reductions of CO 2 emissions per unit of electricity produced. However, certain modifications to power plants to increase power output can potentially increase pollutant emissions, thus triggering new source review (NSR) requirements. Therefore, any modifications made must be shown to reduce pollutants if NSR is to be avoided. Expenditures to increase efficiency would likely be evaluated on a cost vs. benefits approach, with modifications to improve efficiency varying according to many factors, including the type of fuel burned, and the age and the physical condition of the power plant.", "Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) will not be a focus of improvements discussed in this report, as there are no CCS technologies considered as commercially available for full-scale application to the broad majority of existing coal-fired power plants, and EPA has stated that it does not expect to require CCS at existing plants.", "This report focuses on efficiency improvements to power plants, and discusses retrofits, technologies, and other modifications to facility operations which offer the potential to improve power plant efficiency and reduce CO 2 emissions.

Coal's low-priced, high energy content enabled the building of power plants able to take advantage of economies of scale in steam-electric production. ", "In a steam power plant, coal (or other combustible fuel) is burned to provide heat for turning water into steam in a boiler.

Anthracite coal is a small part of the electric power market, and is mostly found in the Appalachian region of Pennsylvania.", "The amount of CO 2 emitted from a coal-fired power plant (CFPP) varies with the type of coal burned. The combustion of coal in the presence of oxygen causes its carbon and hydrogen constituents to react, releasing CO 2 emissions and water, with varying amounts of other products such as oxides of nitrogen and sulfur, carbon monoxide, and fine particulate matter.

As shown in the simplified schematic of a pulverized coal plant in Figure 3 , a steam electric power plant consists of a number of basic components. Coal is crushed and fed into a boiler where it is burned to heat water into steam. The steam is injected under pressure into a turbine which turns a generator (where essentially a magnet turns in a coil of wire causing electrons to flow thus creating an electric current). Steam returning from the turbine is then cooled in a condenser, and the water is fed back by a feedwater pump to the boiler to continue the process. The expansion of water into steam vapor (and condensation back into liquid water) in this manner is called a Rankine Cycle, and is the basis for most electric power generation in the United States. ", "A typical coal-fired power plant has multiple generating units, each with its own steam generating boiler. Usually, coal is pulverized by a combination of crushing and grinding until a desired degree of fineness is achieved. The coal is sieved, and dried using heated air before it is conveyed to a furnace where it is burned to produce steam. Steam pressure and temperature are specifically related, as steam's temperature rises with increasing steam pressure. The pressure and temperature of the steam produced have been rising steadily over the years, ranging from yesterday's sub-critical units to today's ultra-super critical units.", "Subcritical steam generation units operate at pressures such that water boils first and then is converted to superheated steam. At supercritical pressures, water is heated to produce superheated steam without boiling. Due to the improved thermodynamics of expanding higher pressure and temperature steam through the turbine, a supercritical steam generating unit is more efficient than a subcritical unit. ", "Ultra-supercritical steam (USC) generation currently is the most efficient technology for producing electricity fueled by pulverized coal. A USC unit operates at supercritical pressure and at advanced steam temperatures of 1,100 \"F ...These temperatures and pressures enable more efficient operation of the turbine cycle. This increase in efficiency reduces fuel (coal) consumption, and thereby reduces emissions, solid waste, water use and operating costs.", "While pulverized coal units are most common in the United States, coal-fired power plants use other technologies to burn coal including cyclone-fired boilers, fluidized bed combustion, and integrated coal gasification/combined cycle technologies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Coal Power Plants Are Aging", "paragraphs": ["According to EIA, approximately 73% of U.S. coal-fired power plants were age 30 years or older at the end of 2010.

Most of this generating capacity was built between 1950 and 1990. The aging majority of U.S. coal-fired capacity contrasts against the recent surge in younger wind power and natural gas-fired capacity additions whose generating capacity is mostly less than 10 years old. ", "The efficiency of coal-fired power plants, in particular, decreases with age. While good maintenance practices can keep power plant efficiency high in the early years of life, as the plant ages, power plant performance and efficiency erode after about 25 to 30 years of operation, and substantial work may be required to keep the plant operating efficiently and economically.", "All power plants are subject to retirement when they reach the end of their useful service life. As power plants age, they are generally upgraded to continue operations, but the least efficient plants may be retired. Other plants may be shifted from base load operations (in which they essentially operate around the clock) to less demanding intermediate or peaking schedules. The cost of building a power plant is generally recovered over the depreciable life of the asset, such that operations and maintenance (O&M) expenses become the major component of an older power plant's continuing costs. A major component of O&M is the cost of fuel, and the expectation of continued lower prices for natural gas is weighing on decisions concerning whether many older, less efficient coal power plants will be mothballed or closed altogether. The costs of modernizing older power plants to meet new regulatory requirements can be relatively high. When the cost of upgrades to meet new environmental requirements is considered along with (perhaps increasing) O&M expenses, many older coal power plants are likely to face outright retirement decisions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Efficiency of Power Plants and Power Plant Systems", "paragraphs": ["Improving the efficiency of existing coal plants could potentially result in large reductions of CO 2 emissions per unit of electricity produced. Since GHG emissions from electricity generation are essentially composed of CO 2 emissions, improvements in efficiency are a direct means of reducing GHG emissions.", "The performance of a power plant can be expressed by a number of measures, including heat rate (i.e., the efficiency of conversion from fuel energy input to electrical energy output), and thermal efficiency. In its simplest form, a plant's heat rate (for a particular period) can be defined as follows:", "HR = F / E ", "where,", "HR = heat rate (Btu/kWh)", "F = heat energy input supplied by fuel to the power plant for a period (BTU)", "E = energy output from the power plant in a period (kWh)", "Since the equivalent BTU content of a single kWh of electricity is 3,412 BTU, thermal efficiency can be calculated as:", "TE = (100) ( 3412 ) / HR ", "where ,", "TE = thermal efficiency (%)", "As an example, using the average heat rate in 2011 of 10,444 BTU/kWh for coal-fired power plants (i.e., all coal types), the average efficiency for coal-fired plants was 33%. ", "A lower heat rate represents a more efficient generating unit, since it requires less heat input to generate a kWh of electric energy. A generating unit can thus improve its efficiency by reducing the fuel it uses relative to a specific amount of electricity generated, thus reducing the amount of CO 2 emitted.", "A percentage improvement in heat rate is nearly equivalent to an equal percentage improvement in the emissions rate in terms of the change in CO 2 emissions. The difference stems from the small variation in carbon per Btu across coal varieties. The heterogeneity in heat rates across coal-fired generation units can partly be explained by technical characteristics determined at the time of plant construction that cannot be changed without a major overhaul. This category includes size, age, firing type, and the technology employed. Higher efficiency is generally associated with plants that are used more heavily because efficient units are less costly to operate.", "A second factor is how the boiler is used. The relationship between the heat rate and utilization is nonlinear, as efficiency tends to be lower at very low and very high levels of utilization ... Units with lower utilization may be ramped up and down more frequently, which requires additional fuel input as temperature in the boiler fluctuates. The result could involve efficiency losses at least partly outside the control of plant decision makers. Plant managers control several other factors that affect heat rates. Techniques, management, or technology may improve the efficiency of the plant by targeting the major components of the coal combustion process: oxygen, temperature, and pressure. Excessive deviations in any of these areas may decrease efficiency through waste or shortfalls ...Maintenance and performance testing are also critical for identifying and preventing losses.", "Therefore, in practical terms, a power plant's heat rate can be affected by a number of factors and power plants systems. Heat rate may present one measure of efficiency, but when considering power plant GHG emissions, measuring carbon dioxide emissions per unit of energy output (i.e., per kWh or per MWh of generation) may provide a more useful measure. ", "Each power plant thus presents a unique opportunity when looking at the issue of increasing efficiency, and reducing emissions. Figure 5 illustrates a relationship between efficiency improvement and CO 2 emissions (for CFPPs using bituminous coal) highlighting the lower emissions of higher pressure CFPPs. Upgrading from subcritical operation to supercritical steam conditions (with required pollution technology) could add at least 20 years to a plant's service life, depending on the regulatory and environmental regime in place. A subcritical plant could achieve at best 40% efficiency (on an LHV basis), while a supercritical steam plant could potentially achieve an efficiency two points higher and emit 4% less CO 2 . Advancing the technology from a supercritical to an advanced ultra-supercritical CFPP could see an efficiency of 46% to 48%, which could mean as much as 18% to 22% less CO 2 per MWh generated than an equivalent-sized subcritical PC unit.

Lower power plant efficiency results in more CO 2 being emitted per unit of electricity generated. The mode of operation (i.e., base load vs. cyclical) also has a large effect on efficiency and fuel use.

Some propose to add yet another element of renewable energy to the system, generally by incorporating electricity generated by intermittent renewables such as wind or solar power. A number also aim to incorporate some form of carbon capture and storage.", "As biomass is generally considered carbon neutral, co-firing coal with biomass can provide advantages for electric power generation. However, using biomass on a large, commercial scale has a number of potential issues. Since the heating value and bulk density of biomass is lower than coal, the necessary volumes to be harvested and handled can be substantial, and the type and availability of different biomass materials tends to vary considerably with location. A potential source of biomass in the United States could be wastes from the forest products industry."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Barriers to Implementing Efficiency Upgrades", "paragraphs": ["Government regulations, regulatory regimes (i.e., competitive markets or traditional cost of service regulation), and industry factors (such as growth or a lack of growth in demand) all affect the motivation for implementing improvement projects at coal-fired power plants.

NSR was established by Congress as part of the 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments ( P.L. 95-95 ). ", "The NSR process requires power plant operators to undergo a review for environmental controls if they build a new power generating unit, and to impose the Best Available Control Technology, as defined by the state permitting authority (or in some cases EPA). Efficiency improvements to power plants that reduce regulated pollutants should not theoretically trigger NSR requirements, unless the improvements result in an increase in emissions (e.g., because the modified plant operates for more hours). Establishment of a pre-improvement emissions baseline before and a post-improvement emissions report after efficiency upgrades seems like a logical step, but may not be easily achievable on a consistent basis. There are also ambiguities in the law which may serve to hamper efficiency projects from going forward.", "Power plants built prior to 1971 are exempted from the limits on criteria pollutant emissions contained in the Clean Air Act, but may lose that exemption and be forced to undergo an NSR if the EPA determines that the plant has undergone non-routine maintenance which increase emissions.", "The power generation industry widely views the NSR process as an obstacle to power plant efficiency improvement projects. In a 2002 report to the President, the Environmental Protection Agency concurs, stating \"that NSR as applied to existing plants discourages projects that would have provided needed capacity or efficiency improvements.\"", "According to NETL, there are two critical issues with respect to the NSR and efficiency improvements: ", "The definition of \"routine maintenance, repair, and replacement\" projects, and Whether a unit's emission rate or its total emissions over a specified time should be used to determine if an efficiency improvement project increases emissions.", "NETL further stated that several developments since the passing of the 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments have failed to clarify these issues and made efficiency improvements risky and less appealing to plant operators. On the other hand, NETL also stated that \"[u]nder future scenarios, the added value of higher efficiency in meeting GHG emissions limits, may prevent the NSR from being utilized as a barrier to capital investments aimed at improving power plant efficiency.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fuel Prices for Electricity and Regulatory Uncertainty", "paragraphs": ["Increases in the domestic production of natural gas (primarily due to hydraulic fracturing of gas shales) are causing a dramatic change in electric power production decisions. A recent decline in natural gas prices has come with increased production of natural gas, and the resulting decline in coal consumption for power generation. In April 2012, for the first time in U.S. history, the amount of electricity generation from natural gas equaled that of coal, according to EIA statistics, with each representing about 32% of the market. ", "However, as Figure 7 illustrates, coal has recently rebounded and regained market share for electricity generation as natural gas prices have risen. EIA states that since May 2013, \"a combination of higher prices for natural gas and increased demand for electricity during the summer months led electric systems across much of the country to increase their use of coal-fired units.\"", "Growth in demand for electricity is expected to be low over the coming decades. By itself, this would ordinarily be expected to reduce new power plant construction, and might prompt some coal plant owners to consider projects to increase efficiency from existing plants. However, lower natural gas prices, higher coal prices, slower economic growth, and the implementation of new environmental rules are all expected to play a role in the level of coal plant retirement decisions.

The general assumption is that EPA will establish some target for emissions on a state or plant-by-plant basis, with companies free to decide how they will achieve the reduction (i.e., with efficiency, fuel switching, retirement of older units, priority dispatch for cleaner units, etc.), and with emissions averaging, banking, and trading of emissions credits playing a role. Within such a system, efficiency improvements can be an important contributor.", "While the details of the proposal are unknown at this time, the proposal may take into account a number of factors (such as the remaining useful life of the existing source), and could be less stringent than the proposal for new sources of power plants emissions of GHGs. ", "Power plant efficiency may be another factor which EPA may potentially consider in its guidelines for existing sources. NETL observed in its 2010 report that based on a scenario where CFPP generation was constant at the 2008 level, increasing the average efficiency from 32.5% to 36% could reduce U.S. GHG emissions by 175 MMmt per year or 2.5% of total U.S. emissions in 2008. NETL conceded that barriers existed to achieving a higher average fleet efficiency level, citing the power generation industry's focus on availability (focused on the profitability of coal-fired generating units), inconsistent cost pass through possibilities (some deregulated areas have cost pass through clauses, and zero or negative incentives in many areas for reduced fuel use), fear of triggering New Source Review, and uncertainty about GHG regulations (which could lead to very short payback periods for improvements). ", "If power plant efficiency is an option EPA proposes for state consideration, the question then may be asked how a fleet-wide improvement program could be achieved in United States. One possible approach might be to follow NETL's suggestion of using the top decile of CFPP efficiency as a benchmark for U.S. fleet efficiency, used with an efficiency frontier. Using statistical methods, benchmarks could be used to improve efficiency of the CFPP fleet. NETL observes that while some improvements could be \"relatively inexpensive\" (for example, improved O&M, more frequent or pro-active maintenance), other improvements could be \"very expensive\" (for example, improvements bundled with a new SO 2 scrubber, or turbine overhauls or heat exchanger replacement). But NETL notes that \"if each plant achieved their maximum efficiency each year, 5% reduction in CFPP carbon dioxide emissions\" could result.", "According to NETL's analysis, retirements of lower efficiency units combined with increased generation from higher efficiency refurbished units, and advanced refurbishments with improved operation and maintenance, would be the key to increasing average fleet efficiency.", "Efficiency improvements could be incentivized using an efficiency frontier. The selection of appropriate incentives would then encourage CFPP owners to undertake improvements or retire lower efficiency units. Such incentives could include possible tax rate reductions for CFPP owners matched in some manner to the cost of the improvements, or accelerated book depreciation rates for cost recovery. Penalties could perhaps be used to encourage prompt retirement of the lowest efficiency units. ", "The incentives could be in place over a defined period of years, with incentives reduced during the period to encourage action sooner rather than later. The effective period of incentives would have to be sufficiently long enough to allow equipment orders to be satisfied, and simultaneous work to progress at multiple CFPP sites across the country which might seek to make improvements considering equipment lead times and workforce availability. The benchmark could be revised periodically. This could allow newer power plants to live out a service life matched to the most efficient operation achievable for a particular type of CFPP, based on industry statistics. This could allow companies that have made substantial investments in pollution controls an opportunity to recover these investments.", "However, EPA's expected proposal on standards for GHG emissions from existing coal-fired power plants will be a primary factor in determining whether efficiency improvements will be cost effective in the near term."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Policy Options", "paragraphs": ["The efficiency of coal-fired power plants decreases over time as components and systems degrade with age and use. Good O&M practices can slow down the loss of efficiency, but older power plants will not be as efficient as newer plants with more technologically advanced and newer systems. But simply replacing old power plants with newer plants is rarely cost effective as the relative increase in power output seldom justifies the cost. CFPPs that are more efficient emit less CO 2 per unit of electricity produced because they use less coal. Making improvements to increase the efficiency of CFPPs (while producing the same electrical output) could result in a significant reduction in CO 2 emissions. According to several of the studies summarized in this report, the major improvements in GHG emissions would likely result from major retrofits in technology, or conversions to natural gas (or possibly biomass) as a fuel.", "Detailed information on the actual cost of efficiency-enhancing improvements is not readily available, as concerns over confidentiality and competitiveness with regard to actual projects has largely prevented the sharing of such information. The studies referenced in this report largely show relative information on cost (i.e., high, medium, low), estimate the cost effectiveness of improvements, or mention general cost levels. The case studies have reported costs of efficiency improvements and actual increases in efficiency for specific power plant. But these are considered as useful for estimating a range of costs for improvements rather than actual guides for costs, since each power plant has its own design characteristics and maintenance history. Actual cost information would require a technical evaluation, and a cost vs. benefit analysis to obtain reliable cost estimates for the options under consideration, taking into account site-specific conditions.", "Other potential roles exist for Congress. For example, legislation could use tax incentives to encourage energy efficient upgrades for CFPPs which were placed in-service after a certain date. This would allow newer units with environmental controls to recover the cost of scrubbers and other systems, and allow \"newer\" units to continue operations over a \"reasonable\" service life, and recover the cost of environmental improvements.", "Another approach might be to use a federal energy efficiency standard to accomplish a similar goal as an efficiency frontier, but allow the states to design the program based on local fuel resources, the age of power plants under their jurisdiction, and other criteria defined in legislation. The efficiency standards could increase over time, and require CFPPs not meeting these standards to retire.", "Deference to state authorities and regional compliance strategies have been suggested by observers with regard to EPA's deliberations over GHG reduction for existing CFPPs. State public utilities commissions (or similar entities) often require utilities to conduct book depreciation studies (either in connection with rate cases or independent of rate cases). Such studies commonly examine the physical condition of power plants, and the utility's recovery of its investment in electric plant. Federal legislation could tie incentives for efficiency improvements to such studies and direct states to meet individual or regional goals for GHG reduction."], "subsections": []}]}}
