Most enter care because they have experienced neglect or abuse by their parents. Between 35% and 60% of children entering foster care have at least one chronic or acute physical health condition that needs treatment. As many as one-half to three-fourths show behavioral or social competency problems that may warrant mental health services. A national survey of children adopted from foster care found that 54% had special health care needs. Research on youth who aged out of foster care shows these young adults are more likely than their peers to report having a health condition that limits their daily activities and to participate in psychological and substance abuse counseling.", "The Social Security Act addresses some of the health care needs of children in, or formerly in, foster care through provisions in the titles pertaining to child welfare (Titles IV-B and IV-E) and to the Medicaid program (Title XIX). Under child welfare law, state child welfare agencies are required to have a written plan for each child in foster care that includes, among other items, the child's regularly reviewed and updated health-related records. In addition, state child welfare agencies, in cooperation with state Medicaid agencies, must develop a strategy that addresses the health care needs of each child in foster care. Upon aging out of foster care, youth must receive from the state child welfare agency a copy of their health record and information about health insurance options and designating other individuals to make health care decisions on their behalf if they are unable to do so on their own.", "States are not permitted to use federal child welfare program funds to pay medical expenses of children in care or those who left foster care due to their age or placement in a new permanent family. However, states can (and do) receive federal support through Medicaid to pay a part of the medical expenses, including well-child visits, dental care, and other services for many of these children and youth. In FY2010, the most recent year for which these data were available from all states, Medicaid agencies reported spending $5.754 billion to provide services to foster care children. Most of this Medicaid services spending was provided on a fee-for-services basis (82%) with the remainder provided through managed care arrangements.", "Most children in foster care are eligible for Medicaid under mandatory eligibility pathways, meaning that states must provide coverage because these children receive assistance under the Title IV-E program, or, because they meet other eligibility criteria such as low income, or receipt of Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Children in foster care who are not eligible under mandatory pathways generally qualify for Medicaid because the state has implemented one or more optional eligibility categories allowing coverage. Further, children who leave foster care for legal guardianship and nearly all children with state-defined \"special needs\" who leave foster care for adoption retain mandatory eligibility for Medicaid provided they receive Title IV-E assistance. Additionally, special needs adoptees who receive state-funded support may also be eligible under an optional Medicaid eligibility pathway specifically for them.", "Separately, as of January 1, 2014, states are required to continue Medicaid coverage to youth who age out of foster care on their 18th (or later) birthday. This Medicaid coverage was added to the law by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148, as amended), must be available until the youth reaches age 26, and unlike most Medicaid pathways must be provided without regard to the youth's income and assets. This new pathway for youth who age out of care without return to their parents or placement with a new permanent family parallels another ACA requirement that directs health insurance companies to continue coverage of children up to age 26 who are enrolled in their parents' private health care plans. Additionally, under a separate eligibility pathway states continue to have the option of providing Medicaid to youth aging out of foster care (up to the age of 21). Under this optional pathway, and unlike the newer mandatory pathway, a youth does not need to have received Medicaid while in foster care to be eligible for the coverage.", "Effective January 1, 2014, the ACA established the Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) income counting rule. MAGI draws on federal income tax rules (with certain revisions defined in Medicaid law and regulation) to establish uniform standards for what income to include or disregard in determining Medicaid eligibility for most non-elderly and non-disabled people. In transitioning to the new MAGI income counting rule, states were required to establish income eligibility thresholds no less than the effective income eligibility levels that were applicable in the state on the date of enactment of the ACA (i.e., March 23, 2010). In addition to this transition policy, several additional protections ensure that children in, or formerly in, foster care retain eligibility under the new counting rules.", "The ACA made additional changes to assist adults in obtaining private health insurance, and young adults leaving foster care may benefit from these changes. The ACA may also include new opportunities for providing health insurance to child welfare-involved children and their families, such as those children in foster care who are vulnerable to losing Medicaid upon returning home."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Children who are placed in foster care are at a higher risk of having a medical, social, or behavioral disability than children in the general population. The abuse or neglect most experience before entering foster care can create physical and mental health issues, and the trauma of being removed from their parents may also incline children in foster care to social or behavioral health concerns. The Social Security Act addresses some of the health care needs of children in foster care\u2014through provisions in titles pertaining to child welfare (Titles IV-B and IV-E) and those in the title pertaining to the Medicaid program (Title XIX). Federal child welfare policy expects state child welfare agencies to maintain health care records of children in foster care and to develop a strategy that addresses the health care needs of each child. States must provide Medicaid coverage to children who are eligible for the Title IV-E federal foster care program or, if applicable, eligible through other Medicaid eligibility pathways. ", "Effective January 1, 2014, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148 , as amended) created a new mandatory Medicaid pathway for young adults up to age 26 if they were in foster care at age 18 and were receiving Medicaid. This new mandatory coverage category for youth aging out of foster care is distinct from the ACA Medicaid expansion requirements in Section 2001 of the ACA that are related to coverage for most non-elderly adults with annual incomes below 133% of the federal poverty level. For that group, the U.S. Supreme Court's 2012 decision in National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) v. Sebelius effectively made state participation in ACA Medicaid expansion voluntary. However, the Supreme Court's decision leaves enforcement of other provisions of the ACA intact, including the new coverage group created by the ACA for youth aging out of foster care. Accordingly, all states were expected to comply with the new mandatory coverage category for youth who have aged out of foster care as of January 1, 2014. The ACA made additional changes outside of Medicaid to assist adults in obtaining private health insurance, which may benefit young adults who age out of foster care and families who are served by child welfare agencies.", "This report begins with a discussion of major findings. It then briefly describes the foster care population and their unique health-related issues. Next is an overview of the federal programs and policies in three areas\u2014child welfare, Medicaid, and private health insurance\u2014that directly or indirectly address some of the health care needs of such children and young adults. Appendix A discusses selected research on the health care needs of children in foster care and those who leave foster care due to age or placement in a permanent adoptive family. Appendix B shows Medicaid services spending, in selected years, for \"foster care\" children (as that group is defined in Medicaid eligibility and claims data). Appendix C summarizes the major mandatory and optional Medicaid eligibility pathways for current and former foster children."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Findings", "paragraphs": ["Approximately 35% to 60% of children placed in foster care have at least one chronic or acute physical health condition that needs treatment, including growth failure, asthma, obesity, vision impairment, hearing loss, neurological problems, sexually transmitted diseases, and complex chronic illnesses. As many as one-half to three-fourths show behavioral or social competency problems that may warrant mental health services. Studies indicate that many health and mental health care issues persist and that\u2014relative to their peers in the general population\u2014children who leave foster care for adoption and those who age out of care continue to have greater health care needs. (For more information, see \" Health Care Needs of Children in Foster Care \" and Appendix A .) Federal child welfare policy includes health-related provisions. For example, child welfare agencies must ensure that the health care records of children in foster care are periodically reviewed and updated. In addition, states must develop a strategy that addresses the health care needs of each child in foster care including, among other things, health care screenings and oversight of prescription medicines. States must also ensure that young people aging out of foster care are provided a copy of their health records, and information about health insurance options and designating other individuals to make health care decisions on their behalf in the event that they are unable to do so. (For more information, see \" Child Welfare Policies Addressing the Health Care Needs of Children in Foster Care and Those Aging Out of Foster Care .\") Federal child welfare law requires cooperation between state child welfare and Medicaid agencies to ensure that the health needs of children in foster care are properly identified and treated. Given the distinct roles played by the child welfare and Medicaid agencies, understanding precisely what cooperation means and how it should occur remains a question. To date, federal guidance on this matter has primarily focused on monitoring psychotropic medication use and improving access to psychosocial mental or behavioral health screening and services. (For more information, see \" Child Welfare Policies Addressing the Health Care Needs of Children in Foster Care and Those Aging Out of Foster Care .\") State child welfare and state Medicaid agencies refer to different, albeit overlapping, populations when describing who is in foster care. For child welfare agencies, children in foster care include all those under the state agency's care and placement responsibility (on a round-the-clock basis) without regard to whether they are eligible for Title IV-E foster care assistance. By contrast, the state Medicaid agency principally counts as a \"foster care\" child any individual eligible for Title IV-E assistance (whether foster care maintenance payments, adoption assistance, or kinship guardianship assistance). For policy makers and researchers this difference in who is counted as being in foster care makes it difficult to understand the type and level of Medicaid services provided to children currently living in foster care versus those who have left foster care for new permanent homes. The difference in meaning of the same term may also introduce challenges for administrators seeking to work across agencies to ensure access to appropriate services for children in foster care. (For more information, see \" Varying Definitions of Children in Foster Care .\") Analysis of state-reported Medicaid claims shows that fee-for-service remains the most common form of payment arrangement for Medicaid services provided for \"foster care\" children. However, there has been strong growth in the use of managed care arrangements to provide Medicaid services to \"foster care\" children (as described by the Medicaid agency). The share of Medicaid services spending provided through managed care arrangements increased from a little more than 5% of total Medicaid services spending for \"foster care\" children in FY2001 to close to 18% in FY2010. Among Medicaid services provided on a fee-for service basis, spending on \"prescribed drugs\" generally grew from FY2001 through FY2008 but appears to have leveled off since that time. Several other fee-for-service categories have been consistently important for Medicaid \"foster care\" children across the FY2001-FY2010 time period. These are \"other services\" (which includes support for certain home and community based waiver services and other items), \"clinic services,\" \"inpatient mental health facilities,\" \"inpatient hospital services,\" and \"rehabilitative services.\" (For more information, see \" CRS Analysis of Medicaid Spending For Foster Care Children .\") As of January 1, 2014, the modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) rule is used in determining eligibility for most of Medicaid's non-elderly and non-disabled populations. In transitioning to MAGI, the ACA directed states to establish income eligibility thresholds for children that are not lower than the effective income eligibility levels that were applicable in the state on the date of enactment of the ACA. Several policies work to ensure that children who would have been eligible prior to the ACA, including those in foster care or those who left foster care for adoption, legal guardianship, or via aging out, do not lose access to Medicaid. (For more information, see \" ACA Income Counting Rule, Protections for Children, and\u00a0Exemptions .\") The ACA created a new mandatory Medicaid pathway (beginning January 1, 2014) for young adults up to age 26 if they were in foster care at age 18 and were receiving Medicaid. Unlike most Medicaid eligibility pathways, eligibility for former foster youth who aged out of care must be provided without regard to the youths' income and assets. In addition, states may not require mandatory enrollment in Medicaid alternative benefit plans for these individuals, but former foster care youth may be subject to premiums and cost-sharing. Proposed regulations interpret the law to mean that a youth must be enrolled in Medicaid at the time he or she ages out of foster care (as opposed to at any time while the child was in foster care). In addition, proposed regulations and subsequent guidance do not require states to cover eligible foster youth who aged out of care in another state, but permit states to do so. Final regulations on these issues are pending. (For more information see, \" Young Adults Who Were Formerly in Foster Care \" and \" Implementing the New Eligibility Pathway .\") As of January 1, 2014, the ACA requires states to extend Medicaid coverage to certain non-elderly adults with annual income up to 133% of the federal poverty level (i.e., the ACA Medicaid expansion group). However, in June 2012 the U.S. Supreme Court held in NFIB vs. Sebelius that the federal government cannot terminate current Medicaid federal matching funds if a state refuses to expand its Medicaid program to include the ACA Medicaid expansion group. The Supreme Court's ruling effectively allows states to choose whether or not to provide Medicaid coverage to this new eligibility group. As of August 2014, a total of 27 states and the District of Columbia have chosen to do this. More states may choose to do so at any time. In states that elect to include the ACA Medicaid expansion group in their Medicaid state plans, the expansion may enable more family members with children in foster care\u2014or otherwise involved with child welfare\u2014to qualify for Medicaid. (For more information, see \" Eligibility \" and \" Possible Coverage for Child Welfare-Involved Families .\") The ACA made additional changes outside of Medicaid to assist childless adults and children and their families (e.g., children in foster care who are vulnerable to losing Medicaid upon returning home) in obtaining and maintaining Medicaid eligibility, and in obtaining private health insurance. The ACA includes private health insurance reforms that prohibit insurance industry practices such as denying health insurance based on health factors and excluding coverage for preexisting health conditions. These and other provisions are designed to provide protection to potentially vulnerable groups with a high prevalence of preexisting conditions, which could include youth previously in foster care. (For more information, see \" Selected Private Health Insurance Reforms under the ACA .\") The ACA also requires the establishment of health insurance exchanges, which are currently in operation in every state and the District of Columbia. Exchanges provide qualified individuals and small businesses access to private health insurance plans. In general, the exchange plans provide comprehensive coverage and meet all applicable market reforms specified in the ACA. To make exchange coverage more affordable, eligible individuals may receive financial assistance in the form of premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies. These ACA provisions may provide additional options to young adults who age out of foster care and/or families who are served by child welfare agencies to access private health insurance.

Placement in foster care means that a judge has determined that the child's removal from his or her home was necessary because the home was \"contrary to the welfare\" of the child and, accordingly, the judge has given responsibility for the child's \"care and placement\" to the state child welfare agency. The large majority of children enter foster care because of neglect or abuse at the hands of their parents. However, in some instances a child's behavior may also be a reason for entry into foster care; this is more often true for older children. ", "During FY2013, some 641,000 children spent at least one day (24 hours) in foster care and 238,000 left the system, resulting in more than 402,000 of those children remaining in care on the last day of that fiscal year. Although there is variation at the state level, the national foster care caseload has generally been in decline for more than a decade. Across the nation, there were 122,000 fewer children in foster care on the last day of FY2013 as compared to the last day of FY2002 (when 524,000 were in care).", "Foster care is intended to be a temporary placement for children, and a primary goal of child welfare agencies is to expeditiously find a permanent family for them. For most children who enter foster care, permanency is achieved through returning to their parents (after services have been provided to make this a safe and appropriate permanency home for the child). When reunification is not possible or appropriate, however, children must remain in care until a new permanent adoptive family, legal guardian, or \"fit and willing\" relative can be identified. For some children, no new permanent family is identified. These children, who leave foster care when they reach the state's age of majority, are said to have \"aged out\" of care. This typically occurs at age 18 but may occur a year or more later (usually no later than age 21) if the state chooses to extend foster care custody.", "Of the approximately 238,000 children who left foster care custody during FY2013, most\u2014almost six out of every 10 (59%)\u2014returned to their biological parents or went to live with another \"fit and willing\" relative while another 29% (131,000) left care for new permanent homes via adoption or legal guardianship. However, another 10% (23,000) aged out of foster care custody without reunification or placement in a new permanent family. The number of youth who age out of foster care each year initially increased over the past decade, rising from 19,000 in FY2002 to nearly 31,000 in FY2009, as the share of foster care exits attributable to aging out grew to 11%. The number of children aging out of foster care may have stabilized in recent years due to an expected decrease in the number of children in foster care ages 10 through 17.

For example, chronic problems include growth failure, asthma, obesity, vision impairment, hearing loss, neurological problems, gastro-esophageal reflux, sexually transmitted diseases, and complex chronic illnesses.

", "Children who leave foster care often carry with them significant health and mental health needs. A national survey of children adopted from foster care found that 54% had special health care needs, which means they have one or more conditions (expected to last 12 months or more) that required ongoing need for more medical, mental health, or educational services than is usual for most children of the same age. Other research has found that young adults who aged out of foster care at age 18 or soon thereafter were more likely than their peers generally to report having a health condition that limits their daily activities and to participate in psychological and substance abuse counseling.

", "Under two formula grant programs included in Title IV-B\u2014the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services program and the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program\u2014the federal government provides funds to state child welfare agencies for provision of a wide range of child welfare-related services to children and families. Overall, the focus of those services is to support and strengthen families (whether biological, adopted, or extended) in ways that ensure children's safety, permanence (with a stable family), and well-being. Funding is provided on a discretionary or capped entitlement basis and states may generally choose to serve any child or family they believe would benefit from these services. The exact number of children and families served via these programs is not known. However, most are believed to access services following an investigation or other child protection agency response to an allegation of child abuse or neglect. In FY2012, state child protection agencies conducted some 2.1 million child abuse and neglect investigations or assessments, involving some 3.8 million children. Many states mandate that services be provided during the investigation as needed. In addition, roughly 1.2 million of these children received services after the conclusion of the investigation\u2014either in the home (79% of those receiving post-investigation services) or via removal to foster care (21%). ", "The Title IV-E program has three main components: foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance. States that choose to operate a Title IV-E program (all states do) must provide foster care maintenance payments to each eligible child in foster care and must enter into an adoption assistance agreement with parents of each eligible adopted child. States are not required to provide kinship guardianship assistance to eligible children who leave foster care for placement with a legal (relative) guardian. However, states may elect to offer this assistance (in which case any child eligible for kinship guardianship, as defined in the state's Title IV-E plan, must be served). Not all children in foster care and not all those leaving care for guardianship or adoption are eligible for federal assistance under Title IV-E, and eligibility for Title IV-E varies by each of these components. (The various Title IV-E eligibility criteria are summarized in the context of Medicaid eligibility in a subsequent discussion.) Funding for the Title IV-E program is authorized as an open-ended entitlement; states are entitled to federal reimbursement for a part of each eligible cost incurred on behalf of an eligible child. In FY2013, close to 608,000 children received Title IV-E assistance on an average monthly basis, and more than two-thirds of these children (71%) had exited foster care for adoption and were receiving adoption assistance.", "Finally, under the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (Section 477, Title IV-E of the Social Security Act) state child welfare agencies receive funds to provide independent living services\u2014such as mentoring, tutoring, substance abuse prevention, and preventive health services\u2014to youth who are expected to age out of foster care (without placement in a new permanent family), those who have recently aged out, and those who left foster care for adoption or kinship guardianship at age 16 or older.

Studies that estimated use of psychotropic medication for some part of a child's stay in foster care showed that the medicines were being prescribed to much higher percentages of these children compared to other Medicaid-enrolled children or other children who have had contact with child welfare but were not in an out-of-home placement.

However, like traditional Medicaid, ABPs are required to cover EPSDT services, family planning services and supplies, and both emergency and non-emergency transportation to and from providers. This array of benefits might make them more generous than private insurance.

While states set eligibility criteria for individuals they serve they must do this within federal minimum standards. Some eligibility groups defined in federal law are mandatory; others are optional. For most groups (mandatory or optional) to qualify for coverage, applicants' incomes, and sometimes their resources or assets, must meet Medicaid financial requirements. Historically, in addition to low-income criteria, Medicaid eligibility was generally limited to certain groups (or categories) of individuals, including those with disabilities, the elderly, children, adults in families with dependent children, and pregnant women. However, with enactment of the ACA, Congress moved away from eligibility restrictions based on these categories and moved toward broader Medicaid eligibility for low-income individuals (under age 65). ", "Specifically, Section 2001 of the ACA added a new eligibility group to the Medicaid statute to include individuals under the age of 65 with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level provided, generally, that they were not already eligible for Medicaid.

Sebelius, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the federal government cannot terminate current Medicaid federal matching funds if a state refuses to expand its Medicaid program to include the ACA Medicaid expansion group. This effectively makes state participation in the expansion voluntary because it limits the ability of the Secretary of HHS to enforce coverage of the expansion group through withholding of federal funds. At the same time, the Court's decision did not specifically affect, change, or limit any other Medicaid or ACA provisions. Further, if a state chooses to accept ACA Medicaid expansion funds (tied to providing coverage to the ACA Medicaid expansion group), it must abide by all the coverage rules related to this new eligibility group.

Growth in \"prepaid health plans\" (shown as \"PHP-Capitation\" in Figure 1 ) has been less dramatic and, since FY2008, appears to have stalled or at least slowed.

Under the PCCM model, the managed care provider receives a monthly fee to act as a care coordinator and/or gatekeeper to the services specified under the managed care contract. However, services provided are generally paid by the state Medicaid agency through the fee-for-service delivery system.

Such deductions allow them to meet applicable Medicaid financial requirements. This is referred to as the \"medically needy\" pathway\u2014the MAGI-income counting rules do not apply for this group. Any state that opts to provide medically needy coverage is required to extend that coverage to children under age 18, pregnant women, certain newborns, and certain other specified, protected persons.

This includes youth who were in the care and placement responsibility of a state or tribal child welfare agency without regard to whether the youth received Title IV-E assistance or were placed in licensed or unlicensed foster care living arrangements. Additionally, the proposed rule interpreted the law to mean that a youth must be enrolled in Medicaid at the time he or she ages out of foster care (as opposed to at any time while the child was in foster care). Subsequent guidance also explained that states have flexibility in determining the process for verifying that youth were in foster care receiving Medicaid at age 18 (or a later age if applicable), and may allow youth to attest to this themselves. Separately, the subsequent guidance clarified that individuals who would qualify for Medicaid under both the new group for former foster and the new low-income adult category must be enrolled under the group for former foster youth.", "As first described in the January 2013 proposed rule, CMS interprets the law to mean that a state is not required to cover former foster youth who would otherwise be eligible under this pathway if the youth aged out of care in a different state. At the same time, the proposed rule notes that states would be permitted to provide this coverage and, pending final regulations, the agency has instructed states that it will approve Medicaid state plan amendments from states opting to provide coverage to such former foster youth. As of mid-October 2014, as many as 12 states extended this coverage (CA, GA, KY, LA, MA, MI, MT, NY, PA, SD, WI, and VA).", "CMS explicitly sought comment on its interpretation of the law, which could mean former foster youth who move across state lines between ages 18 and 26 lose access to this Medicaid coverage. In a letter to HHS, some Members of Congress noted that young people who (under the ACA) receive health insurance coverage through their parents' plans until age 26 do not have a comparable residency requirement. The letter also asserted that former foster youth need access to quality health coverage, regardless of state of residency, because of their relatively negative outcomes across a number of health and other domains. Some stakeholders have asserted that providing coverage to youth under the new pathway can help to reduce costs in the future because youth will presumably receive routine and preventive services. Legislation introduced in the 113 th Congress ( S. 2461 and H.R. 5364 ) seeks to ensure that Medicaid coverage is available for former foster youth under this pathway regardless of where they reside. ", "A separate issue with regard to scope of coverage under this new eligibility pathway for former foster youth concerns the age at which youth may qualify for this pathway. Specifically, any youth who ages out of foster care prior to reaching age 18\u2014such as the approximately 1,000 to 2,000 foster youth who emancipate at age 17 each year \u2014are not eligible for the new mandatory pathway. The law requires that youth must have been in foster care under the responsibility of the state at age 18 (or a later age as elected by the state under its Title IV-E plan). These youth would also not be eligible for the Chafee pathway, which requires them to have been in foster care on their 18 th birthday. States may consider taking steps to inform such youth that they would be ineligible for Medicaid coverage under these pathways if they are formally \"emancipated\" (age out) from care before age 18.", "For those youth who are eligible for the new Medicaid eligibility pathway, another implementation question has to do with the extent to which youth can be enrolled and maintain enrollment under the mandatory Medicaid pathway when they age out of foster care. Current child welfare law provides that as part of a transition planning process for youth aging out of foster care, each youth must be made aware of specific health insurance options. This planning process, which is to occur within 90 days of a youth's aging out of care, might be used to inform youth about Medicaid eligibility and enrollment. CMS has highlighted that at least one state, Idaho, is using the state child welfare independent living coordinator to reach out to former foster youth. ", "A 2012 HHS-supported study on state implementation of the Chafee optional pathway for former foster youth suggests that Medicaid administrators, child welfare staff, and the youth themselves may need to be educated about the new eligibility pathway for former foster youth. This is, in part, because youth aging out of foster care make up a very small share of Medicaid recipients, and few Medicaid staff may be knowledgeable about the new pathway. Further, Medicaid and child welfare agencies may lose contact with the youth when they are no longer involved in foster care and/or lack stable housing. Indeed some state Medicaid administrators have raised concerns about the costs of tracking, identifying, and confirming eligibility for this population.

Specifically, the ACA requires exchanges to perform outreach to help individuals (and small businesses) make informed decisions about their insurance options, including the operation of \"navigator\" programs. Navigators carry out public education activities; provide information to prospective enrollees about insurance options and federal assistance; and examine enrollees' eligibility for other federal or state health care programs, such as Medicaid. A variety of organizations may become navigators, including labor unions, trade associations, chambers of commerce, and other entities; however, it is not immediately clear which entities are best suited to assist this population. Finally, staff in child welfare and Medicaid agencies and those who run the exchanges must be trained to understand the ACA and its implementation in their state to enable them to best assist applicants in obtaining insurance.", "Appendix A. Research on the Health Needs of Certain Children and Youth Formerly in Foster Care", "As discussed in the body of this report, health care needs of children in foster care are considerable. Research on health care needs of children who age out of foster care and those who leave foster care for adoption are discussed in greater detail in the following section. Many of these former foster care children and youth are counted as \"foster care\" children under the Medicaid data reporting system. Thus, the type and prevalence of their health care needs affects our understanding of Medicaid use by \"foster care\" children. As of July 1, 2014 states are required to submit Medicaid program data via a revised reporting system. In this new system (T-MSIS) former foster youth who aged out of care are counted separately from children who are in foster care. However, many children who leave foster care for adoption are expected to continue to be included in the Medicaid \"foster care\" children population. ", "Young Adults Who Were Formerly in Foster Care", "The research literature regarding children who age out of foster care shows that physical and mental health problems persist into adulthood. Two studies\u2014the Northwest Foster Care Alumni Study and the Midwest Evaluation of the Adult Functioning of Former Foster Youth\u2014have tracked outcomes for a sample of youth across several domains, either prospectively (following youth in care and as they age out) or retrospectively (examining current outcomes for young adults who were previously in care and comparing these outcomes to those of young people in the general population).", "Researchers with the Northwest Foster Care Alumni Study interviewed and reviewed the case files of 479 foster care youth who were in public or private foster care any time from 1988 to 1998 in Oregon or Washington. The study compared the mental health status and education and employment outcomes for the foster care alumni to those of the general population. Over 54% of foster care alumni had at least one mental health problem\u2014depression, social phobia, panic disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, among others\u2014compared to 22.1% of the general population. About one-quarter of the alumni experienced post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This figure is greater than the occurrence of PTSD among Vietnam or Iraq War veterans, which is about 15%. Foster care alumni tended to have recovery rates similar to their counterparts in the general population for major depression, panic syndrome, and alcohol dependency, but lower rates of recovery for other disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD, social phobia, and bulimia.", "Few foster care alumni studies are prospective, meaning that they follow youth while in care through the time they leave care and beyond. The Midwest Evaluation is an ongoing study that tracks approximately 600 former foster youth in three states\u2014Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. Table A-1 displays the physical health and mental health outcomes for alumni at ages 25 and 26 compared to their same-age peers in the general population. Overall, youth formerly in foster care reported having more negative health outcomes than their general population peers and participating in counseling and substance abuse treatment more often. They were also less likely than their peers to be covered by employers' health care plans, and more likely to have public health insurance. ", "Separately, HHS data of current and former foster youth at age 19 show differences in health insurance coverage depending on whether the youth was still in foster care. Among 19-year-olds who were still in care in FY2013, 99% had Medicaid coverage. This is compared to 80% of youth who were no longer in foster care.", "Children Adopted from Foster Care", "Children adopted from foster care are those children who were removed from their biological parents \u2013 typically because of abuse or neglect \u2013 and for whom reuniting with those biological parents was determined not possible or not in the child's best interest. Roughly 50,000 to 55,000 children leave foster care for a permanent adoptive family each year. The large majority of these children (84% in FY2013) were determined by the state to have \"special needs\" that made it \"reasonable\" for the state to conclude the child would not be adopted without provision of an adoption subsidy and/or medical assistance.", "Greater Health and Mental Health Needs", "A nationally representative survey conducted in 2007 found children who were adopted \u2013 whether from foster care, domestically by private arrangement, or from another country \u2013 tended to have greater health and mental health needs than children in the general population. Further, among all adopted children, those who were adopted from foster care had the greatest needs. For example, 19% of all children in the nation were reported by their parents as having special health care needs in 2007, compared to 39% of all children who were adopted and 54% of children adopted from foster care. Additionally, among children ages 6 through 17, about 1 in 10 (10%) in the general population had been formally diagnosed with attention deficit disorder (ADD) or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) at some point and, at the time of the 2007 survey, the parents of about 1 in 25 children (4%) considered their child's diagnosed ADD/ADHD condition to be moderate or severe. The comparable rates among all adopted children in this age range was more than 1 in 4 ever diagnosed (26%) and roughly 1 in 8 with a current moderate or severe condition (14%); for those in this age range who were adopted from foster care, more than 1 in 3 had ever received an ADD/ADHD diagnosis (37%) and fully 1 in 5 (20%) had a current moderate or severe condition as reported by their adoptive parents. ", "The 2007 survey also found that 2% of all adopted children (ages 8 through 17) had spent some time in a residential psychiatric facility or hospital following their adoption; the comparable share reported for children adopted from foster care was 7%. (Because this question is linked specifically to services provided after a child was adopted there is no comparable percentage for children in the general population.) Table A-2 shows these and additional data on the health and mental health needs of children adopted from foster care compared to all adopted children and children generally.", "More Likely to Have Insurance Coverage", "At the same time, children who are adopted are more likely to have had continuous (over past 12 months) health insurance coverage than children in general. The 2007 survey of adopted parents found that 85% of all children had this continuous coverage, compared to 91% among all adopted children and 94% of children adopted from foster care. Federal law provides that the children adopted from foster care who have \"special needs\" (which may be but are not necessarily related to health or mental health needs) are eligible for Medicaid (or a comparable state benefit plan). Not surprisingly then, public health insurance is the most common form of coverage among children adopted from foster care. Nearly 6 in 10 (59%) were reported by their adoptive parent as covered by Medicaid or CHIP \u2013 roughly double the 3 in 10 (29%) children generally who were covered by those public programs. ", "Although 37% of children adopted from foster care were covered by private insurance coverage, some of these privately insured children were also enrolled in Medicaid. Parents of children adopted from foster care reported that 65% had ever received a Medicaid benefit, over half (55%) used Medicaid for dental care, and nearly one out of three (32%) used Medicaid to pay for mental health services. In those instances where a child is covered by both Medicaid and private insurance, the law provides that Medicaid is the payer of last resort. This means that the private insurer must pay any covered benefits first. However, Medicaid coverage could supplement those benefits (if the private insurance benefits are exhausted) and it might wholly fund services not covered by the adopted children's private insurance carriers (e.g., many private insurers do not cover residential psychiatric treatment). ", "Appendix B. Medicaid Services Spending for \"Foster Care\" Children", "Children for whom these spending data are reported in the Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS) include those determined to be a \"foster care\" child under MSIS based on their Medicaid eligibility pathway. These children principally include those who are eligible for federal Title IV-E assistance whether they are in foster care or have left that care for adoption or legal guardianship. They may also include children who are receiving state-funded adoption assistance as well as some children who have aged out of foster care. Children who are in foster care but who are not eligible for Title IV-E assistance do not appear to be included in this category.", "Appendix C.
