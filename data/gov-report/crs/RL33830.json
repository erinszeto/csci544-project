Since the issue of voting representation for District residents was first broached in 1801, Congress has considered five legislative options: (1) seek voting rights in Congress by constitutional amendment, (2) retrocede the District to Maryland (retrocession), (3) allow District residents to vote in Maryland for their representatives to the House and Senate (semi-retrocession), (4) grant the District statehood, and (5) define the District as a congressional district for the purpose of voting representation in the House of Representatives.", "On January 6, 2009, the non-voting delegate for the District of Columbia, Eleanor Holmes Norton, introduced H.R. 157, the District of Columbia Voting Rights Act of 2009, a bill that would permanently increase the size of the House from 435 to 437 Members and provide voting representation to the District and the state most likely to gain an additional representative, Utah. Weeks later, on January 23, 2009, Representative Dana Rohrabacher introduced H.R. 665, a bill that would provide voting rights to District citizens by retroceding the District of Columbia to Maryland. Also on January 6, Senator Lieberman introduced S. 160, a related bill of the same title as H.R. 157. The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee reported S. 160 on February 12, 2009. The House Judiciary Committee reported an amended version of H.R. 157 on February 25, 2009, by a vote of 20-12. A provision amending the city's gun control laws was introduced during Committee markup of the bill, but was withdrawn before a vote. The full Senate passed the bill on February 26, 2009, by a vote of 61-37. The Senate bill includes a controversial provision unrelated to voting rights that would amend the District's gun control laws.", "These proposals would grant voting representation by statute, eschewing the constitutional amendment process and statehood option. Any proposal considered by Congress faces three distinct challenges. It must (1) address issues raised by Article 1, Sec. 2 of the Constitution, which limits voting representation to states; (2) provide for the continued existence of the District of Columbia as the \"Seat of Government of the United States\" (Article 1, Sec. 8); and (3) consider its impact on the 23rd Amendment to the Constitution, which grants three electoral votes to the District of Columbia.

Opponents often note that the Constitution grants only states voting representation in Congress. They argue that, given the District's unique status and a strict reading of the Constitution, no avenue exists to provide District residents voting rights in the national legislature other than a constitutional amendment or the statehood process, which could be achieve by statute.", "Issues central to the District of Columbia voting representation debate arguably revolve around two principles of our republican form of government: (1) the consent of the governed and (2) no taxation in the absence of representation. The debate has also involved questions about how to reconcile two constitutional provisions: one creating the District and giving Congress exclusive legislative power over the District (Article I, Section 8); the other providing that only citizens of states shall have voting representation in the House and Senate (Article 1, Section 2 and Section 3).", "Over the years, proposals to give the District voting representation in Congress have sought to achieve their purpose through", "constitutional amendment to give District residents voting representation in Congress, but not granting statehood; retrocession of the District of Columbia to Maryland; semi-retrocession, i.e., allowing qualified District residents to vote in Maryland in federal elections for the Maryland congressional delegation to the House and Senate; statehood for the District of Columbia; and other statutory means such as virtual-statehood, i.e., designating the District a state for the purpose of voting representation.", "In the recent past, Congress has restricted the ability of the District government to advocate for voting representation.

One year after establishing the District of Columbia as the national capital, District residents began seeking representation in the national legislature.

It is contrary to the genius of our constitution, it is violating an original principal of republicanism, to deny that all who are governed by laws ought to participation in the formulation of them.", "Woodward noted that the Senate represented the interest of sovereign states and that no state was disadvantaged due to its population because the Constitution granted each state an equal number of Senate votes. He acknowledged the distinction between the Territory of Columbia and states and argued that the Territory, whose residents were citizens of the United States, should be considered half a state and thus entitled to one vote in the Senate.

Congress would have been empowered to provide the District with one or two votes in the Senate and such votes in the House that it would be entitled based on its population.
