In its FY2019 FMAP calculations, HHS used state per capita personal income data for 2014, 2015, and 2016 that became available from the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in September 2017. The use of a three-year average helps to moderate fluctuations in a state's FMAP rate over time.", "BEA revises its most recent estimates of state per capita personal income on an annual basis to incorporate revised and newly available source data on population and income. It also undertakes a comprehensive data revision\u2014reflecting methodological and other changes\u2014every few years that may result in upward and downward revisions to each of the component parts of personal income. These components include the following: ", "earnings (wages and salaries, employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds, and proprietors' income); dividends, interest, and rent; and personal current transfer receipts (e.g., government social benefits such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, state unemployment insurance).", "As a result of these annual and comprehensive revisions, it is often the case that the value of a state's per capita personal income for a given year will change over time. For example, the 2014 state per capita personal income data published by BEA in September 2013 (used in the calculation of FY2017 FMAP rates) differed from the 2014 state per capita personal income data published in September 2017 (used in the calculation of FY2019 FMAP rates).", "It should be noted that the definition of personal income used by BEA is not the same as the definition used for personal income tax purposes. Among other differences, BEA's personal income excludes capital gains (or losses) and includes transfer receipts (e.g., government social benefits), while income for tax purposes includes capital gains (or losses) and excludes most of these transfers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Factors That Affect FMAP Rates", "paragraphs": ["Several factors affect states' FMAP rates. The first is the nature of the state economy and, to the extent possible, a state's ability to respond to economic changes (i.e., downturns or upturns). The impact on a particular state of a national economic downturn or upturn will be related to the structure of the state economy and its business sectors. For example, a national decline in automobile sales, while having an impact on all state economies, will have a larger impact in states that manufacture automobiles as production is reduced and workers are laid off.", "Second, the FMAP formula relies on per capita personal income in relation to the U.S. average per capita personal income . The national economy is basically the sum of all state economies. As a result, the national response to an economic change is the sum of the state responses to economic change. If more states (or larger states) experience an economic decline, the national economy reflects this decline to some extent. However, the national decline will be lower than some states' declines because the total decline has been offset by states with small decreases or even increases (i.e., states with growing economies). The U.S. per capita personal income, because of this balancing of positive and negative, has only a small percentage change each year. Since the FMAP formula compares state changes in per capita personal income (which can have large changes each year) to the U.S. per capita personal income, this comparison can result in significant state FMAP rate changes.", "In addition to annual revisions of per capita personal income data, comprehensive revisions undertaken every four to five years may also influence regular FMAP rates (e.g., because of changes in the definition of personal income). The impact on FMAP rates will depend on whether the changes are broad (affecting all states) or more selective (affecting only certain states or industries)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FY2019 Regular FMAP Rates", "paragraphs": ["Regular FMAP rates for FY2019 (the federal fiscal year that begins on October 1, 2018) were calculated and published November 21, 2017, in the Federal Register .
