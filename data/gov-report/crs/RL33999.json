The total for FY2007 also represents, in part, requested funding. It includes $93.4 billion in FY2007 supplemental appropriations that the Administration requested in February 2007. In May, however, Congress actually approved $99.4 billion for the Department of Defense, $6.0 billion more than the Administration had asked for. Table 4 shows the recommendations on defense budget authority and outlays in the House and Senate versions of the annual budget resolution, H.Con.Res. 99 and S.Con.Res. 21 . These amounts are not binding on the Armed Services or Appropriations committees. Table 5 shows congressional action on the FY2008 defense authorization bill by title. Technically, this table shows the budget authority implications of the provisions of the bill. For mandatory programs, the budget authority implication is the amount of budget authority projected to be required under standing law. The table also follows the common practice of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, which is to show as the \"budget authority implication\" of the bill, the amounts expected to be available for programs within the national defense budget function not subject to authorization in the annual defense authorization bill. Except for some mandatory programs, the authorization bill does not provide funds but rather authorizes their appropriation. Appropriations bills may provide more than authorized, less than authorized, or the same as authorized, either in total or for specific programs. Appropriations bills may provide no funds for programs authorized and may provide funds for programs not authorized. In practice, defense appropriations bills often follow the amounts authorized, however. Table 6 shows congressional action on the FY2008 defense and military construction appropriations bills. The table does not show funding for defense-related activities of agencies other than the Defense Department, except for about $1.0 billion for the intelligence community. In particular, it does not include $17.4 billion requested for defense-related nuclear energy programs (nuclear weapons and warship propulsion) of the Energy Department. Table 7 shows House and Senate Appropriations Committee allocations of funds under Section 302(b) of the Congressional Budget Act, for defense and military construction/veterans affairs appropriations bills compared to allocations for other, non-defense bills. The \"302(b)\" allocations are a key part of the appropriations and budget process. A point of order holds against any bill that exceeds its 402(b) allocation. In recent years, appropriations have trimmed allocations for the defense appropriations bill, freeing up more money for non-defense appropriations. The effect on defense was mitigated by the available of emergency appropriations for defense. In effect, emergency appropriations for war costs have been used indirectly to finance higher non-defense appropriations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FY2008 Defense Budget Request and Outyear Plans: Questions of Affordability and Balance", "paragraphs": ["Several aspects of the Department's FY2008 budget request and its projected budgets through FY2013 raise questions about the affordability of DOD's plan as a whole and about the balance of spending among major elements of the defense budget.", "(1) DOD ' s funding plan for FY2008-FY2013, excluding the cost of military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, projects that the department ' s base budget will increase in real purchasing power, after adjusting for inflation, by 8.0% between FY2007 and FY2008 and by another 3.5% in FY2009 before declining slightly over each of the following four years. But the tightening fiscal squeeze on the federal government may put strong downward pressure on the defense budget; and the unbudgeted funds needed for ongoing military operations abroad may compound the problem. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) agree that the current mix of federal programs is fiscally unsustainable for the long term. The nation's aging population combined with rising health costs are driving an increase in spending for federal entitlement programs which, in turn, will fuel rising deficits compounded by a steadily increasing interest on the national debt. The upshot is that, if total federal outlays continue to account for about 20% of the GDP and federal revenues remain at about their current level, total federal spending on discretionary programs, in terms of real purchasing power, would have to be sharply reduced to meet the goal of a balanced federal budget by 2012 and then to cover the rising costs of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security resulting partly from the retirement of baby boomers.", "To protect DOD from this fiscal vise, some have recommended that the defense budget (excluding the cost of ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan) be sustained at 4% of GDP\u2014a share of the national wealth that DOD last claimed in FY1994. But that proposal would have to overcome the thus far intractable political challenges of increasing federal revenues, reducing discretionary non-defense spending, and/or restraining the growth of entitlement costs.", "(2) Although the Administration has submitted a budget proposal to cover the cost of ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in FY2008 that is separate from its \" base \" budget request for the year, it may be difficult, as a practical matter, for Congress to subject the request for cost-of-war appropriations to the same oversight it applies to regular, annual defense spending requests. If the congressional defense committees mark up the FY2008 defense funding bills on their usual schedules, as the House and Senate Armed Services committees are doing with respect to the annual defense authorization bill, they will have had to review in less than four months both the President's $482 billion request for the base DOD budget and the additional $142 billion requested for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The burden may be compounded by the fact that the congressional defense committees may not have time-tested analytical tools with which to scrutinize the request for ongoing combat operations, as they do for reviewing the base budget. Moreover, for most of that four month period, Members of Congress, and the defense funding committees in particular, have been deeply preoccupied with debate over the Administration's FY2007 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill ( H.R. 1591 ) to pay for combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, legislation that has become the vehicle for congressional efforts to reduce the involvement of U.S. troops in Iraq.", "In addition, since DOD does not include the forecast cost of ongoing operations in its projections of defense budget requests in future years, except for a $50 billion placeholder for FY2009 included in the FY2008 request, Congress has not been given a clear sense of how severely the federal government's overall fiscal squeeze may constrain future defense budgets.", "(3) DOD projects that its total budget will remain approximately constant, in real terms, from FY2009 through FY2013. But for years, most of the major components of the defense budget have shown a steady cost growth, in excess of the cost of inflation. Thus, the relatively flat defense budgets planned would have to accommodate other types of costs that also seem to be escalating almost uncontrollably, notably including (1) the rising cost of health care for personnel still on active service, retirees and their dependents, (2) operations and maintenance costs that have been increasing since the Korean War at an average of 2.5% per year above the cost of inflation, and (3) new weapons that are expected to dramatically enhance the effectiveness of U.S. forces, but which carry high price tags to begin with and then, all too often, substantially overrun their initial cost-estimates.", "(4) One of the most powerful drivers of DOD ' s internal cost squeeze, the steady increase in the cost of military personnel, would be compounded by the President ' s recommendation\u2014in line with congressional proposals\u2014to increase active-duty Army and Marine Corps end-strength. Between FY1999 and FY2005, the cost of active-duty military personnel, measured per-service-member, grew by 33% above inflation, largely because of congressional initiatives to increase pay and benefits. A large fraction of the increased cost is due to increases in retired pay and greatly expanded medical benefits for military retirees.", "This year, the Administration has proposed (and the congressional defense committees have urged for years) an increase in active-duty end-strength that would add 92,000 soldiers and Marines to the rolls, thus increasing the services' fixed costs by at least $12 billion annually (once the start-up costs of the policy have been absorbed). At the same time, the Navy and Air Force are cutting personnel levels to safeguard funds for weapons programs. The Air Force is cutting about 40,000 full-time equivalent positions and the Navy about 30,000. One issue is whether these cuts will be used, directly or indirectly, not to pay for Air Force and Navy weapons programs, but for Army and Marine Corps end-strength increases.", "(5) The Navy ' s ability to sustain a fleet of the current size within realistically foreseeable budgets may especially problematic. After years of criticism from Members of Congress who contended that the Navy was buying too few ships to replace vessels being retired, the service released in February a long-range shipbuilding plan that would fall just short of the Navy's current goal of maintaining a fleet of 313 ships. But the plan assumes that the Defense Department, which bought seven ships in FY2007 and is requesting the same number in FY2008, would buy between 11 and 13 ships in each of the following five years. The plan assumes that amount appropriated for new ship construction would rise from a requested $12.5 billion in FY2008 to $17.5 billion in FY2013 (in current-year dollars).", "Considering the fiscal demands likely to put downward pressure on future defense budgets, funding the Navy's plan may be challenging. But even if the Navy got the annual shipbuilding budgets it plans to request, it might not be able to buy all the ships it plans as quickly as it plans to do so, because of escalating costs and delays in some of the new types of ships slated to comprise the future fleet. In the past, Navy cost and schedule forecasts later proven to be overly optimistic have led to long-range shipbuilding plans that promised increases in shipbuilding budgets in the \"out-years\" that have not been realized. Unachievable shipbuilding plans may discourage the Navy and Congress from weighing potential tradeoffs between, on the one hand, construction of promising new designs and, on the other hand, building additional ships of types already in service and upgrading existing vessels.", "(6) The services ' plans to modernize their tactical air forces suffer from the type of excessive budgetary and technological optimism that also afflicts the shipbuilding plan. Roughly midway through a 40-year, $400 million effort to replace the post-Vietnam generation of Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps fighter planes with versions of the Air Force's F-22A, the Navy's F/A-18E/F, and the tri-service F-35 (or Joint Strike Fighter), the services' plans have been buffeted by escalating costs, slipping schedules and external budget pressures. In the case of the F-22A, this produced a current budget plan that will buy only 183 planes rather than the 381 the Air Force says it needs. Similarly, the Navy and Marine Corps have reduced the total number of F-35s they plan to buy from 1,089 to 680.", "Adjustments like this are easier to make with aircraft budgets that fund dozens of units annually costing tens of millions of dollars apiece than it is with shipbuilding budgets that fund a handful of units each year, many of which cost upwards of a billion dollars apiece. But while it may be easier for the services to deal with the consequences of optimistic tactical aircraft recapitalization plans than it is for the Navy to manage the shipbuilding program, there is a similar underlying problem. If the services' long-range plans assume budgets, costs, technical breakthroughs and production schedules that will not be realized, a service may delay and, ultimately, increase the cost of upgrades to planes already in service that will have to be kept combat-ready until the new craft are fielded:", "The military services accord new systems higher funding priority, and the legacy systems tend to get whatever funding is remaining after the new systems' budget needs are met. If new aircraft consume more of the investment dollars than planned, the buying power and budgets for legacy systems are further reduced to remain within DOD budget limits. However, as quantities of new systems have been cut and deliveries to the warfighter delayed, more legacy aircraft are required to stay in the inventory and for longer periods of time than planned, requiring more dollars to modernize and maintain aging aircraft."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issues in the FY2008 Global War on Terror Request13", "paragraphs": ["For the seventh year of war operations since the 9/11 attacks, DOD originally requested $141.7 billion, 29% of the amount it is requesting for all routine DOD activity in FY2008.

In testimony, Secretary of Defense Gates characterized the FY2008 GWOT request as \"a straightline projection for forces of 140,000 in Iraq\" because funding for the surge is only included through September 30, 2007, the end of FY2007. In mid-September 2007, General Petraeus recommended and the President decided to extend the current troop increase of about 30,000 in Iraq for an additional four months in FY2008.", "On September 26, 2007, Secretary Gates announced that the Administration will be submitting a request for an additional $42 billion for war costs in FY2008, including about $6 billion for the extension of the troop surge.

Some, contending that military pay increases have lagged civilian pay hikes by a cumulative total of 4% over the past two decades or so, have called for a 3.5% raise to close that so-called pay-gap. Defense Department officials deny any such pay-gap exists, maintaining that their proposed 3% increase would sustain their policy of keeping military pay at about the 70 th percentile of pay for civilians of comparable education and experience. Congress mandated military pay-raises of ECI plus \u00bd% in FY2000-FY2006. But for FY2007, the Administration requested an increase of 2.2%, equivalent to ECI, and Congress ultimately approved it, rejecting a House-passed increase to 2.7%. Army and Marine Corps End-Strength Increases. The budget request includes $12.1 billion in the FY2008 base budget and an additional $4.9 billion in the FY2008 war-fighting budget toward the Administration's $112.3 billion plan to increase active-duty end-strength by 65,000 Army personnel and 27,000 Marines by 2013. Most of the additional personnel are slated for assignment to newly created combat brigades and regiments, which would expand the pool of units that could be rotated through overseas deployments, thus making it easier for the services to sustain overseas roughly the number of troops currently deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. This recommendation marks a new departure for the Administration, which has resisted for several years calls by the congressional defense committees for such an increase in troop-strength. On the other hand, the proposal might be challenged by Members who wonder how the services, in a time of tightening budgets, will afford the roughly $13 billion annual cost of the additional troops. The proposal also might be opposed by Members skeptical of future extended deployments on the scale of the current missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Tricare Fees and Co-pays. For the second year in a row, the Administration's budget proposes to increase fees, co-payments and deductibles charged retirees under the age of 65 by Tricare, the Defense Department's medical insurance program for active and retired service members and their dependents. The increases are intended to restrain the rapid increase in the annual cost of the Defense Health Program, which is projected to reach $64 billion by FY2015. The budget request also reduces the health program budget by $1.9 billion, the amount the higher fees are expected to generate. The administration contends that these one-time increases would compensate for the fact that the fees have not be adjusted since they were set in 1995. The Administration also is requesting a provision of law that would index future increases in Tricare fees to the average rate of increase in health care premiums nationwide. As was the case last year, the Administration proposal is vehemently opposed by organizations representing service members and retirees, which contend that the Defense Department has failed to adequately consider other cost-saving moves and that retiree medical care on favorable terms is appropriate, considering the unique burdens that have been borne by career soldiers and their dependents. Any future Tricare fee increases, some groups contend, should be indexed to increases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rather than to the much more rapid rise in health insurance premiums. Last year, Congress blocked the proposed fee increases for one year and established a study group to consider alternative solutions to the problem of rising defense health costs. That panel is slated to issue interim recommendations in May, 2007. National Guard Representation on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. A number of National Guard units have been stripped of equipment needed for other units deploying to Iraq, leaving the units at home ill-prepared either to train for their military mission or to execute their domestic emergency role as the agent of their state governor. Some Members of Congress and organizations that speak for the Guard contend that this situation reflects the regular forces' dismissive attitude toward Guard units, which should be counterbalanced by making the Chief of the National Guard Bureau a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and elevating him to highest military rank\u2014general (4 stars)\u2014from his current rank of lieutenant general (3 stars). Congress has rejected these proposals before, but in March a congressionally chartered commission studying National Guard and reserve component issues endorsed the higher rank, while opposing the Joint Chiefs membership. National Guard Stryker Brigades. Governors, Members of Congress and National Guard officials from several states have called on Congress to equip additional Guard combat units with the Stryker armored combat vehicle, which currently equips five active-duty Army brigades and one National Guard brigade (based in Pennsylvania). Stryker brigades deployed in Iraq report the eight-wheeled armored cars to be rugged under fire and agile; and because they move on oversize tires rather than metal caterpillar tracks like the big M-1 tanks and Bradley troop carriers that equip some Guard units, Strykers would be more versatile in domestic disaster-response missions, since they could travel on streets and roads without tearing them up. Perhaps as important as the Stryker units' vehicular capability is the surveillance and information network that is part of a Stryker brigade. It cost about $1.2 billion to equip the Pennsylvania Guard unit as a Stryker brigade. Future Combat Systems. The FY2008 budget request contains $3.7 billion to continue development of the Army's Future Combat System (FCS), a $164 billion program to develop a new generation of networked combat vehicles and sensors that GAO and other critics repeatedly have cited as technologically risky. That critique may account for the fact that, last year, Congress cut $326 million from the Administration's $3.7 billion FY2007 request for the program. Ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan also highlight the concern of some that FCS will be a more efficient way to fight the kind of armored warfare at which U.S. forces already excel while offering no clear advantage in fighting the sort of counter-insurgency operations that may be a major focus of U.S. ground operations for some time to come. Particularly because the FY2008 request includes the first installment of procurement money for FCS ($100 million), critics may try once again to slow the project's pace, at least for the more technologically exotic components not slated for deployment within the next five years. Nuclear Power for Warships. Congress may use the FY2008 bills to continue pressing the Navy to resume the construction of nuclear-powered surface warships. All U.S. subs commissioned since 1959 have had nuclear-powerplants because they give subs the extremely useful ability to remain submerged, and thus hard to detect, for weeks at a time. All aircraft carriers commissioned since 1967 also have been nuclear-powered ships. But because nuclear-powered surface ships cost significantly more to build and operate than oil-powered ships of comparable size, the Navy has built no nuclear-powered surface vessels since 1980, and has had none in commission since 1999. Proponents of nuclear power long have contended that this focus on construction costs has unwisely discounted the operational advantages of surface combatants that could steam at high speed for long distances, without having to worry about fuel consumption. In recent years, they have cited rising oil prices to argue that nuclear-powered ships may not be much more expensive to operate than oil-fueled vessels. In 2006, a Navy study mandated by the FY2006 defense authorization bill ( P.L. 109-163 , Section 130) concluded that nuclear power would add about $600 million to $700 million to the cost of a medium-sized warship, like the Navy's planned CG(X) cruiser, and that such a ship's operating cost would be only 0-10% higher than an oil-powered counterpart, provided crude oil costs $74.15 or more, per barrel (as it did a various times during 2006). Congress might add to the FY2008 bills provisions that would require certain kinds of warships to be nuclear-powered in the future. Alternatively, it might require the Navy to design both oil-powered and nuclear-powered versions of the CG(X), the first of which is slated for funding in the FY2011 budget. Littoral Combat Ships. Congress will closely scrutinize the Navy's most recent restructuring of its plan to bulk up the fleet with a large number of small, fast Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) intended to use modular packages of weapons and equipment to perform various missions. In FY2005-FY2007, Navy budgets funded six LCSs being built to two different designs by two contractors, Lockheed and Northrop Grumman. The Navy plans to select one of the two designs which would account for all the LCSs built beginning in FY2010. But in March 2007, responding to escalating costs in the first few LCS ships under construction, the Navy restructured the program, cancelling contracts for three of the ships already funded and reducing the number of LCS ships requested in the FY2008 budget from three to two. In the FY2008 defense bills, Congress might endorse the Navy's action, add funds for additional ships in FY2008, or take additional steps to ensure that LCS construction costs are under control before additional ships are funded. Virginia-Class Submarines. Members may try to accelerate the Navy's plan to begin in FY2012 stepping up the production rate of Virginia -class nuclear-powered attack submarines from one ship per year to two. Because of the scheduled retirement after 30 years of service of the large number of Los Angeles- class subs commissioned in the 1980 and 1990s, the Navy's sub fleet will fall short of the desired 48 ships (out of a total fleet of 313 Navy vessels) from 2020 until 2033. In addition to approving the Navy's FY2008 request for $1.8 billion to build a sub for which nuclear reactors and other components were funded in earlier years and $703 million for reactors and components that would be used in subs slated for funding in future budgets, Congress may add more so-called \"long lead\" funding for an additional sub for which most of the funding would come in FY2009 or FY2010. The Navy says it would need an additional $400 million down payment in FY2008 to make it feasible to fund an additional sub in FY2010. But Navy officials also argue that buying an additional sub before 2012 could throw future Navy budgets out of balance. F-35 (Joint Strike Fighter). Congress may reject the Administration's proposal to drop development of the General Electric F-136 jet engine being developed as a potential alternative to the Pratt & Whitney F-135 engine slated to power the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Congress has backed development of an alternate engine for the F-35 since 1996 and last year rejected the Administration's proposal to terminate the program, adding $340 million to the FY2007 defense funding bills to continue the alternate engine program. Defense Department officials, noting that they would save $1.8 billion by ending the alternate engine program, contend that because of improvements in the process of designing and developing jet engines, it would not be imprudent to rely on a single type of engine to power what likely will be the only U.S. fighter plane in production after about 2015. Many Members are skeptical of that argument, citing the poor reliability demonstrated in the late 1970s by the Pratt & Whitney F-100 engine that powered both the F-15 and F-16, a problem the caused Congress to mandate development of an alternative (GE-built) engine. Supporters of the dual engine approach also contend that competition between the two engine manufacturers produced significant savings in F-15 and F-16 engine costs, a claim disputed by some analyses. C-17 Production and C-5 Upgrades. There appears to be strong support in Congress for fielding a larger fleet of long-range cargo jets big enough to heavy Army combat gear than Defense Department plans would fund. As in past years, the result may be a combination of congressional actions that would (1) restrict the ability of the Air Force to retire older C-5A planes and (2) fund additional C-17 planes, beyond the 190 the Air Force plans to buy. In March 2006, the Defense Department's first \"post 9/11\" review of its long-range transportation needs concluded that the services' long-range airlift needs could be met, with acceptable risk, by the Air Force's plan to upgrade fleet of 109 C-5s (divided between \"A\" and newer \"B\" models) and to buy a total of 180 C-17s. Rejecting the department's analysis on several grounds, Congress barred retirement of any C-5s and added 10 C-17s to the FY2007 defense funding bills. The most conspicuous change in this issue since then has been the Administration's decision to enlarge the Army and Marine Corps, a move which, arguably, requires a larger airlift fleet. Air Force Tanker Procurement. The $315 million requested in FY2008 to develop a new mid-air refueling tanker to replace the Air Force KC-135s well into their fifth decade of service may become a vehicle for congressional action intended to bolster the position of either Boeing or the team of Northrop Grumman and Airbus, who are competing for the contract in a contest scheduled to be decided late in 2007. Immediately at issue is a contract for 179 refueling planes. But follow-on contracts may bring the number of planes ultimately purchased to 540. New Nuclear Warhead. Differences over the future role of nuclear weapons in U.S. national security planning may crystalize into a debate over the $119 million requested in the FY2008 national defense budget to continue development of a so-called Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW), which is intended to replace warheads that were built in the 1970s and 1980s and have been kept in service longer than initially planned. That total includes $89 million for the National Nuclear Security Administration of the Department of Energy and $30 million for the Navy. The new warhead is intended to be easier to maintain than aging types now in service and to be deployable without breaking the moratorium on nuclear test explosions the U.S. government has observed since 1992. Supporters argue that RRW is needed because of concerns that maintenance of currently deployed warheads may prove increasingly difficult in the long term. On the other hand, critics of the RRW program contend that fielding new warheads of an untested type might build political pressure to resume testing eventually. Moreover, they contend, that the program to extend the service life of existing warheads without testing has proven successful for more than a decade and should become even more reliable because of advances in understanding of the physics of current weapons. Since the funds requested in FY2008 would allow the RRW program to cross a critical threshold, from design and cost analysis to the start of detailed development work, Members who want to rein in the program have a strong incentive to use the FY2008 funding bills to do it. Non-Nuclear Trident Missile Warhead. Months after Congress denied most of the $127 million requested in FY2007 to develop a non-nuclear warhead for the Trident long-range, submarine-launched ballistic missile, the administration has requested $175 million for the program in FY2008. The argument in favor of the program is that it would allow U.S. forces to quickly strike urgent or mobile targets anywhere in the world, even if no U.S. forces were located nearby. On the other hand, some skeptics of the program argue that the system would require precise, virtually real-time intelligence about targets that may not be available and that other countries\u2014including some like Russia and China that are armed with long-range, nuclear-armed missiles\u2014might misinterpret the launch of a conventionally-armed U.S. missile as an indication that they were under nuclear attack. Some Members may try to slow the program, as Congress did last year. Missile Defense Budget. If only because it is the largest acquisition program in the budget, the $8.9 billion requested in FY2008 for the Missile Defense Agency would draw close scrutiny because of the stringent budget limits within which the defense committees are working. But there also may be some efforts to cut that request that are rooted in the long-running debate that continues over how soon missile defense would be needed, and over the relative effectiveness of the many anti-missile systems under development. Efforts are likely to reduce funding for some of the more technologically challenging programs, such as the Airborne Laser (ABL), which has encountered several delays and for which the Administration has requested $549 million in FY2008. Another possible target for congressional cuts is the $300 million requested to begin work on a third anti-missile site in Eastern Europe. Touted by the Administration as a defense against a possible threat from Iran, the proposal to field anti-missile interceptors in Poland has been denounced by Russia. Revisiting BRAC . Because of well-publicized cases of inadequate care received by some Iraq War veterans at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, which is slated for realignment as one of the recommendations made by the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission, and approved by President George W. Bush, critics of some other BRAC actions may be encouraged to try to slow or reverse those decisions. If successful, such efforts might unravel the entire base closure process, which was designed to prevent Members from politicking to save any one particular base from closure. Since 1989, the requirement that Congress and the President deal with each of the four sets of recommended closures as a package, on a \"take it or leave it\" basis, has highlighted the potential savings of the entire package of closures while preventing supporters of any one base from rounding up support for saving their site from closure on the grounds that, considered in isolation, closing it would save very little. But since the furor over Walter Reed has at least prompted some public calls for reconsidering that particular BRAC decision, critics of other closures may argue that changes in circumstance since 2005 require a re-look at other parts of the BRAC package. In addition, jurisdictions anticipating a large population influx as they acquire organizations formerly housed at installations being closed, may seek impact assistance to expand their transportation, utility, housing, and education infrastructures. Contract Oversight. Because of several recent cases in which high profile weapons acquisition programs have been hobbled by escalating costs and technical shortcomings, Members may want to review the management of individual programs and the evolution over the past decade or so of the Defense Department's acquisition management process with an eye toward using the FY2008 funding bills to strengthen the government's hand in dealing with industry. Secretary of the Navy Donald C. Winter and Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael G. Mullen have declared that the Navy intends to reclaim some of the authority over ship design it has ceded to industry and Members may look for ways to jump-start that effort as they deal with, for instance, the troubled Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program. Similarly, Members intent on imposing congressional priorities on the Army's Future Combat System (FCS) may question the amount of managerial discretion the Army has vested in the Lead System Integrator: a private entity\u2014in this case, a team of Boeing and SAID\u2014hired to manage a large, complex program that consists of more than a dozen vehicles and sensors linked by a computer network. One rationale for the outsourcing to industry of management roles previously filled by Pentagon acquisition managers is that the Defense Department no longer has the in-house expertise needed to manage such complicated acquisitions. Some Members may want the Defense Department to come up with a long-term plan to restore enough in-house expertise to make the government a smarter customer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Bill-by-Bill Synopsis of Congressional Action to Date", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Congressional Budget Resolution", "paragraphs": ["Congress has completed, work on the annual congressional budget resolution, which includes recommended ceilings for FY2008 and the following four fiscal years on budget authority and outlays for national defense and other broad categories (or \"functions\") of the federal government.

After years of rejecting recommendations by many Members to increase the number of ground troops, the Administration has launched a plan to increase the permanent end-strength of the Army and Marine Corps by a total of 92,000 troops by 2012. H.R. 1585 would authorize the two services to accelerate the buildup, but would not require them to do so. In addition to funding that end-strength increase, the bill would increase military pay by 3.5%, instead of the 3.0% increase requested, and would bar for the second year in a row a proposed increase in medical care fees for retirees.", "It would mandate several actions intended to improve the quality of military medical care, particularly for service members in outpatient status.

It would add funds to the requests for anti-missile systems designed to protect forces in the field from the sort of short-range and medium-range missiles deployed (or nearly deployed) by potential adversaries such as North Korea and Iran. At the same time, it would slice funding from the amounts requested for the Airborne Laser and for development of space-based anti-missile weapons, more innovative weapons intended for use against long-range missiles that those adversaries have not yet fielded. Similarly, it would cut several hundred million dollars from the request for the Army's Future Combat System program, targeting some of its more exotic elements, while adding funds to expand production of Stryker armored combat vehicles and Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) troop carriers. It also would extend production of the C-17, long-range, wide-body cargo jet, adding funds for 10 more airplanes.", "The House bill would slow some acquisition programs to allow a more orderly process of setting their requirements and testing their effectiveness.

In addition, the bill would slow development of a new troop carrier, slated to replace the High-Mobility, Multi-purpose, Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), until some of the technologies slated for use in the new vehicle are more mature.", "The bill also would slow some programs that might draw adverse international reactions. It would reduce funding for development of a new Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) and for construction of a new production facility for plutonium to be used in nuclear warheads, programs some have said would complicate U.S. efforts to bar the proliferation of nuclear weapons. It also would eliminate funding to deploy anti-missile interceptors in Europe, a plan to which Russia has objected. In addition, the bill would reduce funding for development of a non-nuclear warhead for Trident submarine-launched ballistic missiles, the launch of which\u2014some critics warn\u2014might be mistakenly interpreted as the launch of a nuclear attack.", "Some other highlights of H.R. 1585 include the following:", "Tricare Fee Freeze . As the FY2007 authorization bill did, this bill would bar for one year proposed increases in Tricare fees (including pharmacy fees). The House Armed Services Committee noted that a commission appointed to study alternative Tricare cost controls is not scheduled to complete its work until the end of the year. The bill also would authorize an increase in Tricare funding by $1.9 billion, the amount by which Pentagon officials reduced the Tricare budget request in anticipation of the higher fees. Health Care Improvements . The bill would create an initiative to improve care of service members suffering traumatic brain injury, which is a relatively frequent result of roadside bomb attacks on U.S. vehicles in Iraq. It also would allow the Navy to reduce its number of medical personnel by only 410, rather than the reduction of 900 the budget assumed. The bill also incorporates the provisions of H.R. 1538 , the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act of 2007, passed by the House March 28 which, among many other provisions, would do the following: mandate the assignment of case managers to outpatient service members and require regular reviews of their cases; create toll-free hotlines on which service members and their families can report deficiencies in military-support facilities; establish standardized training programs for Defense Department personnel engaged in evaluating wounded service members for possible discharge on grounds of disability; establish a separate fund to support the treatment of wounded or injured service members and their return to service or their transition to civilian life; mandate development of policies to reduce the likelihood that personnel in combat will experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other stress-related illnesses; require regular inspections of all living quarters occupied by service members recovering from wounds; and prohibit for one year any effort to convert jobs at a military medical facility from military to civilian positions. In addition, the bill would require a long-term longitudinal study of health and behavioral problems experienced by service members deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. It also would require that the annual budget for Walter Reed Army Medical Center not be reduced below the level spent in FY2006 until replacement facilities are available to provide the same level of care provided at Walter Reed in that year. National Guard and Reserve Issues. The bill would elevate the chief of the National Guard Bureau, a position that currently carries with it the rank of lieutenant general, to the rank of general, and would designate that officer as an advisor to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security. However, the bill would not make the Guard Bureau chief a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as some supporters of the National Guard have advocated. The bill also would authorize an addition of $1.1 billion to the $1.1 billion requested for equipment for the National Guard and reserve component forces, an increase intended to address equipment shortfalls. budget in order to fill Guard and reserve equipment shortages. The chief of the National Guard Bureau has estimated that, for the Guard alone, equipment shortfalls would cost $2 billion to fill. In addition, the bill would authorize the addition of $30 million to upgrade the engines on F-16s flown by National Guard squadrons. The bill also would require the Secretary of Defense to send Congress quarterly reports on the readiness of National Guard units to perform both their wartime mission and the domestic missions the would be called on in response to a natural disaster or domestic disturbance. It also would require the Army to submit to Congress a report on the desirability of equipping additional National Guard units with Stryker vehicles. Training. The bill would authorize an additional $250 million for training not covered by the budget request. The committee warned that the readiness of ground combat forces in particular was suffering because their training was focused heavily on the type of mission they would perform in Iraq and Afghanistan, rather than on the full spectrum of missions they might have to execute. Maintenance and Readiness . The bill would add to the budget request $165 million for additional major overhauls of ships, planes, vehicles and electronic equipment beyond what the budget would cover. It also would create a $1 billion Strategic Readiness Fund to allow the services to address equipment shortages that resulted in critical readiness shortfalls. To better focus attention on readiness problems, the bill would create a Defense Readiness Production Board to identify shortages of equipment or supplies anticipated to last for two years or longer. It also requires DOD to report the current readiness of ground forces and prioritize the steps that will be taken to improve the state of readiness. Special Forces Priorities. Several provisions of the bill reflect a concern by some Members that the services' special operations forces have been emphasizing \"direct action\" (efforts to kill or capture terrorists) at the expense of \"indirect action\" (training other countries' security forces and developing working relationships with them to help set conditions that inhibit the spread of terrorism). The bill would require the Special Operations Command to send Congress an annual report on its plan to meet its requirements for indirect action. It also would authorize additional funds for \"irregular warfare support\" research aimed at better understanding radical Islamist strategies and the cultures in which terrorists seek a foothold. Civilian Employees . The bill would change the rules governing so-called A-76 cost competitions to determine whether functions currently performed by federal employees should be contracted out to private companies. The House Armed Services Committee said that the changes, which would tend to advantage federal employees in such a contest, were needed to ensure a fair and balanced cost comparison. The bill also would require a recently created personnel system for civilian DOD employees to provide rights of collective bargaining and appeal rights which are provided by the civil service system. It also would impose limits on the new system's \"pay for performance\" compensation rules. Armored Troop Carriers. The bill would increase by $4.1 billion\u2014to $4.6 billion\u2014the amount authorized to equip Army, Marine Corps and Special Operations units with Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles, shaped and armored to better protect troops from roadside bombs. It approved the requests for $2.3 billion to buy armored HMMWV vehicles and $1.1 billion for add-on armor to protect personnel in other vehicles from roadside bombs. Ground Combat Vehicles . The bill would cut $857 million from the $3.56 billion requested to continue developing the Army's Future Combat System (FCS), a networked set of ground vehicles, unmanned aircraft and sensors that would make up the next generation of ground combat equipment. FCS supporters contended that the cut would cripple the program; but proponents of the reduction contended that the cuts were aimed at more exotic components not slated to enter service for years, sparing elements of FCS that would be available sooner. The bill also approved the request for $4 billion to upgrade M-1 tanks and Bradley armored troops carriers currently in service. It would authorize $88 million of the $288 million requested for the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle, a Marine Corps effort to develop a new amphibious combat vehicle, work on which has been suspended pending a DOD review. Communication Programs Slowed . The bill would cut $2.1 billion from the $2.6 billion requested for the Joint Network Node (JNN), an effort to develop for ground troops an internet-based mobile voice, video and data link that would be used pending development of a more ambitious communications network system designated Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (WIN-T). The House Armed Services Committee contended that JNN could not usefully absorb the amount requested. Moreover, the committee insisted that JNN, which had been launched as an interim system start managed under relatively informal procedures, begin to operate under the more demanding procedures applied to major systems purchases and that the procurement of future lots of the system by competed. The bill also would cut $102 million from the $222 million requested to develop the follow-on communication system, WIN-T. On the other hand, the bill authorized the $964 million requested to develop a satellite-based, long-range communications network linked by lasers. Combat Jets . The bill would authorize production 11 of the 12 F-35 tri-service fighters requested. It would use the $230 million thus saved from the $2.7 billion F-35 procurement request plus $250 million diverted from the $3.5 billion R&D request to continue development of an alternative jet engine, a project the budget would terminate. The bill also would authorize the amounts requested for 20 Air Force F-22 fighters ($3.2 billion, plus $744 million for R&D) and 18 EA-18Gs, which are electronic-jamming versions of the Navy's F/A-18E/F fighter ($1.3 billion, plus $273 million for R&D). It would authorize 33 of the 36 F/A-18E/Fs requested ($2.6 billion, a $182 million reduction from the request). Long-Range Cargo Jets. The bill would add to the budget $2.4 billion for 10 additional C-17 wide-body, long-range cargo jets. DOD's budget would have ended production of the planes, as would its FY2007 budget, which Congress also overrode to keep the C-17 production line running. In addition, the bill would repeal existing law that bars DOD from retiring any of its C-5 cargo jets. The bill would allow the Air Force to begin retiring older C-5s once the production of C-17s, plus remaining C-5s comprised a total long-range cargo fleet of 299 planes. Shipbuilding. The bill included a provision requiring that all new classes of cruisers, submarines and aircraft carriers be nuclear-powered, although the requirement could be waived in any case in which the Secretary of Defense determined it not to be in the national interest. The bill added to the budget request $1.7 billion for a San Antonio-class amphibious landing transport (in addition to the $1.4 billion requested for one of the ships), $400 million for a T-AKE class supply ship (in addition to the $456 million requested for one), and $588 million to buy the nuclear power plant and other components of an additional Virginia-class submarine, for which the bulk of the funds would have to be provided in a future budget (in addition to the $1.8 billion approved as requested for one sub and the $703 million requested for another set of long-leadtime sub components). The bill also authorized $711 million for two smaller warships, designated LCS, which is what the Navy wanted after it dropped from its FY2008 budget request funding for a third ship of the class because of escalating costs in construction of earlier ships of the type. The committee also directed the Navy to report on the underlying causes of the LCS cost-overruns and on steps that were being taken to prevent their recurrence. The bill also authorized the amounts requested to begin work on a nuclear-powered carrier ($2.7 billion), to complete two DDG-1000-class destroyers that were partly funded in the FY2007 budget and to buy components for use in future ships of this type ($2.8 billion), and to complete a helicopter carrier designed to support amphibious landings, some funds for which were provided in the FY2007 budget ($1.4 billion). Missile Defense . The bill would cut a total of $764 million from the $8.8 billion requested for the Missile Defense Agency. The largest cut in a single missile defense program was $250 million cut from the $548 million requested to continue development of an airborne laser (ABL). The bill also would cut $160 million from the $300 million requested to field in Eastern Europe a third cluster of anti-missile interceptor rockets. The cut would block construction of the planned launch silos in Poland. The bill also would authorize a total of $2.5 billion, slightly more than was requested, for Patriot and Aegis systems designed to protect U.S. forces and allies against short-range and medium-range missiles currently deployed by North Korea, Iran and many other countries. It would deny $10 million requested to begin development of space-based anti-missile interceptor missiles. Nuclear Weapons and Non-proliferation. The bill would cut $45 million from the $119 million requested to develop a new nuclear warhead\u2014the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW)\u2014to replace aging warheads current deployed. The House Armed Services Committee said it wanted to slow development of the new weapon pending a report on future U.S. nuclear weapons deployments, which the bill would create a blue-ribbon panel to prepare. The bill also would authorize $142 million of the $175 million requested to develop a non-nuclear warhead for the Trident submarine-launched missile. The committee wanted to defer production of the weapon pending study of how it would be used and how the risk could be minimized that launch of a conventionally-armed Trident would be misinterpreted as nuclear attack. Roles and Missions. The bill would require the Defense Department to review every four years the division of labor\u2014the allocation of \"roles and missions\"\u2014among the four armed services and other Pentagon agencies, identifying the \"core competencies\" of each service or agency. It also would make several changes in the Defense Department's long-range budget and weapons planning processes with the aim of ensuring that future weapons programs be given the go-ahead only if they met the requirements of an agreed-on mission and were to be used by an organization with the appropriate core competency to perform that mission. The bill also would direct the Secretary of Defense to decide whether or not to designate one of the armed services to manage all medium altitude and high altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) programs, for the sake of efficiency. Air Force officials have contended that their service should get that role, a move the other services have strongly opposed. Prospective Ban on Future Use of LSIs. The bill would prohibit the awarding of new contracts for any Lead System Integrator (LSI) on a major system, as of the start of FY2011. The bill would require the Secretary of Defense to send Congress by October 1, 2008, a plan to develop among government acquisition employees the skills needed to perform \"inherently governmental functions\" in managing major acquisition programs. Environmental Issues. The bill would require future periodic revisions of long-range national strategic plans to take account of the impact on U.S. interests of global climate change. The committee said that the strategic, social, political, and economic consequences of climate change could increase political instability in parts of the world. The bill also would require GAO to report on the extent to which the readiness of U.S. forces has improved as the result of several waivers from various environmental laws granted to the Defense Department."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Defense Authorization: Highlights of House Floor Action", "paragraphs": ["House debate on H.R. 1585 , which began on May 16 and was concluded May 17, was governed by a rule ( H.Res. 403 ) that allowed consideration of 50 amendments covering a wide range of subjects.", "Iran Policy.
