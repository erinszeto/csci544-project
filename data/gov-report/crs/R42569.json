It describes the criteria for federal land management agencies to consider in order to close federal lands to fishing, hunting, or recreational shooting, and directs that management is subject to existing law. However, some ambiguities may lead to different, perhaps unintended results. H.R. 4089 passed the House on April 17, 2012.", "Hunting and fishing are already allowed on the majority of federal lands. Because H.R. 4089 would change land management practices and would require additional or different analyses, reports, and notices, the bill would alter federal land management by adding or changing steps in the planning process. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that Title II of H.R. 4089, for example, would cost $12 million over the first four years.", "Title I establishes the processes for federal land management agencies to close federal lands to hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting, and is almost identical to Senate bill S. 2066. Title II addresses recreational shooting in Bureau of Land Management (BLM) national monuments. While the associated House committee report refers to H.R. 4089 affecting lands managed by BLM and the Forest Service almost exclusively, the bills' broad definition of federal public lands could lead to portions of H.R. 4089/S. 2066 extending to all agencies that own land.", "Wilderness areas may be most altered by the bills. While the Wilderness Act already allows hunting and fishing, H.R. 4089/S. 2066 would appear to allow any activity related to those activities, as well as to recreational shooting. This may mean that structures could be built in wilderness areas or mechanized transport could be allowed, which are activities that are banned under current law; however, this is not clear since another provision appears to continue to ban motorized access.", "Titles III through VI address issues related to hunting, fishing, or federal lands. Title III would reverse the administrative rule in place since May 15, 2008, which banned the import of sport-hunted polar bears from Canada. It would allow the import of polar bear trophies by applicants who sought an import permit prior to that date, when the polar bear was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Senate bills S. 2066 and S. 1066 would also direct issuance of those permits. However, in 2011, a federal court rejected a suit to allow such imports.", "Title IV of H.R. 4089 would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from regulating lead shot and lead sinkers, as would S. 838. EPA, however, denies it has the authority to take such action, while state laws could still restrict the use of lead shot and sinkers. Reversing a 2012 Forest Service decision, Title V would allow deer hunters in the Kisatchie National Forest in Louisiana to use hunting dogs without restriction. Title VI would limit the President's ability to establish national monuments under the Antiquities Act of 1906 by requiring both the governor and legislature of the affected state to approve designations."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction to H.R. 4089", "paragraphs": ["While hunting and fishing are permitted on the majority of federal lands, some believe that those recreational activities are unnecessarily restricted by the planning processes of federal land management agencies, such as the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Forest Service, the National Park Service (NPS), and the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). Additionally, some believe courts have misinterpreted the purposes of those lands and impeded recreation. The Sportsmen's Heritage Act of 2012 ( H.R. 4089 ) would \"open\" almost all federal lands and waters to hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting, and establish criteria for land management agencies to close lands to those activities. Opponents of the bill assert that it would adversely affect wilderness areas and create additional, sometimes contradictory, steps for land management agencies in their already complex planning processes.", "Titles I and II establish a uniform system for land management agencies to determine whether federal lands should be closed to hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting. Titles III through VI of H.R. 4089 address issues related to hunting, fishing, or federal lands, such as issuing permits to allow the import of polar bear parts by certain applicants; continuing the use of lead shot and lead sinkers; opening the Kisatchie National Forest in Louisiana for dog-deer hunting; and limiting the President's ability to establish national monuments under the Antiquities Act of 1906. ", "In general, states manage hunting and fishing within their boundaries, and federal laws regulating these activities are a series of exceptions to this general rule. Exceptions include regulating migratory birds, protecting species under the Endangered Species Act, or regulating hunting and fishing on federal lands. Federal land managers work with state managers in regulating the time, place, manner, or quantity of animals to be taken. In short, the delineation of these responsibilities may be summarized as the federal government regulates the habitat, and the state regulates the take.", "Hunting and conservation have been linked since the advent of federal wildlife legislation, such as the Lacey Act of 1900 or the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. As one supporter of H.R. 4089 stated:", "The conservation movement was started by American sportsmen a century ago and since then almost all of our most successful wildlife conservation programs have been associated with recreational hunting and fishing. Species that were once rare, such as wild turkeys, deer, bear and wood ducks are now plentiful as a result of private efforts by sportsmen and scientific management by state fish and game departments.", "Even so, controversy exists about exactly what hunting, fishing, or shooting sports currently are allowed on federal land and when. Some believe federal land planning processes, which include analyses under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), are an obstacle to hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting. Others point to recent court decisions favoring wilderness protection over recreation as restricting statutorily guaranteed recreational access. Opening more lands to hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting should be balanced against good game management, public safety, resource management, and the statutory purposes of the lands. These are a few of the issues addressed in H.R. 4089 .", "The bill is supported by groups including the U.S. Sportsmen's Alliance, National Rifle Association, Safari Club International, and other organizations. Opponents include Wilderness Watch, Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, Humane Society, and others. Wilderness Watch described the bill as \"a thinly disguised measure to gut the 1964 Wilderness Act and protections for every unit of the National Wilderness Preservation System.\" However, one of the supporters of H.R. 4089 , U.S. Sportsmen's Alliance, describes the bill as clarifying \"that hunting, fishing and recreational shooting are legitimate uses of federal public lands and that these lands are open, as a matter of law, to these traditional activities.\" According to Safari Club International, the lack of access is a \"primary reason\" that hunters and anglers stop using federal lands for those activities.", "However, it is not clear whether those goals will be achieved by H.R. 4089 . To the extent that \"access\" means physical access, rather than regulatory, the bill does not provide any funding for road or trail expansion or maintenance. It is also possible that the bill could slow the planning process; it appears to add steps to the land management processes already in place, such as new criteria, reporting requirements, and public notices. H.R. 4089 is silent as to when implementation is required, which could be interpreted as leading to land agencies having to revise all land management plans at the same time. Additionally, the bill proposes different criteria for different types of lands and different types of activities, potentially making application by land management agencies difficult. Finally, in some cases, particularly lands withdrawn for a particular purpose, such as wilderness areas or BLM national monuments, the bill favors activities over the conservation values for which those lands were designated."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Legislative History", "paragraphs": ["Introduced on February 27, 2012, the Sportsmen's Heritage Act of 2012 ( H.R. 4089 ) is an amalgam of three earlier bills.

Under H.R. 4089 , Section 103(1), federal public land means \"any land or water that is owned by the United States; and managed by a Federal agency (including the Department of the Interior and the Forest Service) for purposes that include the conservation of natural resources.\" The definition exempts lands or waters held in trust for the benefit of Indians or other Native Americans (\u00a7103(1)(B)); and Section 104(d) exempts BLM and Forest Service lands on the Outer Continental Shelf. ", "While there is no existing statutory definition of federal public land , the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) defines public lands as BLM lands, the Title I definition is broader than the FLPMA definition, and arguably could be construed to include all federal lands. However, the House committee report refers to H.R. 4089 's affecting only BLM and the Forest Service in all but one reference, suggesting that the definition was not intended to be so broad. The language in the rest of the bill appears to target only the four traditional land management agencies: BLM; NPS; FWS; and the Forest Service. ", "Nevertheless, since the definition of federal public land is not narrowly focused, it could include lands under other agencies, such as the Bureau of Reclamation, the Department of Defense (including the Army Corps of Engineers) , the Department of Energy, and the Department of Commerce, all of which have natural resource conservation as a purpose. A similar, inclusive definition of federal lands was used in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which referred to a number of departments as being necessary to establish rights of way on federal lands: Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, and the Interior. Also, as multiple executive orders direct all agencies with land to preserve the environment, it could be construed that any such agency has as a purpose the \"conservation of natural resources\" and would be covered by Title I of H.R. 4089 .", "If the Title I definition reaches more lands than was intended, the scope could be contained by referring to specific management agencies in the definition rather than trying to describe lands. This approach is used in other legislation. The Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (FLREA), for example, defines Federal land management agency as \"the National Park Service, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Reclamation, or the Forest Service.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Definition of Hunting", "paragraphs": ["Section 103(2) defines hunting for the purposes of Title I to mean \"using a firearm, bow or other authorized means in the lawful pursuit, shooting, capture, collection, trapping, or killing of wildlife; attempt[ing] to pursue, shoot, capture, collect, trap, or kill wildlife; or the training of hunting dogs [including field trials].\" ", "The definition includes two activities that are not traditionally included under this term: trapping and field trials. Trapping is allowed under some circumstances on some federal lands, but the use of traps (particularly a design called leghold traps) has been controversial and is less common than traditional hunting on federal lands. For example, it is not included as one of the six priority uses of Refuge System lands under the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act. While using hunting dogs for waterfowl has not been controversial, field trials have been an issue because of the potential impact of hundreds of participants and spectators and the use of horses at some of these events. ", "Field trials already occur occasionally on some federal lands, under the sponsorship of sporting organizations, where the agencies determined the activity to be compatible with their multiple use or recreation mandates. H.R. 4089 could lead to an expansion of an activity that appears to be rare on federal land and may not exist on NPS lands. Current regulations ban field trials in wildlife refuges, except by special permit. ", "While the definition concerns hunting , use of the term within Title I is somewhat inconsistent. Title I refers to sport hunting twice, and could be read as referring to recreational hunting eight times. The bill does not draw a distinction among the three terms. Similarly, the provision addressing licensing in Section 104(k)(2) refers to \"fish, hunt, and trap,\" which also appears to be inconsistent with the definition, which includes trapping within the definition of hunting. In addition, Section 104(g)(1) refers to \"activities related to fishing and hunting (or both),\" potentially expanding the allowed activities.", "The definition of hunting excludes \"the use of skilled volunteers to cull excess animals.\" Historically, NPS has been reluctant to allow volunteers to carry out culling operations in areas where hunting is forbidden. Instead, NPS has typically requested that Wildlife Services (part of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the Department of Agriculture) carry out that role. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Definition of Recreational Fishing", "paragraphs": ["Section 103(3) defines recreational fishing as \"the lawful pursuit, capture, collection or killing of fish; or attempt to capture, collect, or kill fish.\" The only other statutory definitions of recreational fishing exclude commercial fishing more explicitly. For example, 16 U.S.C. Section 1802(37), of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, defines recreational fishing as \"fishing for sport or pleasure\" while 16 U.S.C. Section 3302(10) of the Salmon and Steelhead Conservation and Enhancement Act defines recreational fishing as \"fishing for personal use and enjoyment using conventional angling gear, and not for sale or barter.\" It is possible that the definition of recreational fishing in H.R. 4089 might be interpreted to include commercial fishing, which may create additional confusion because certain federal land units, such as Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, have implemented specific efforts to phase out traditional commercial fishing that occurred in their marine waters.

It appears those activities were intended to be included and encouraged on all of the federal public land as defined in Section 103(1). However, because of some controversy over the continued existence of shooting ranges on Forest Service or BLM lands, it may be that only those lands were intended to be affected by the promotion of shooting ranges. ", "Recreational shooting, including shooting ranges, on NPS or FWS lands would likely be controversial. While war reenactments might be permitted on certain NPS lands, conversely, their occurrence on FWS lands would not be considered wildlife-dependent recreation, and therefore may be discouraged by land managers.

This provision may raise questions because state law does not authorize actions on federal land. Instead, federal management is exercised to the extent consistent with state law, which establishes hunting seasons, game species, fishing licenses, etc.", "While agencies must manage public lands to facilitate those activities, Section 104(i) states that the title does not require \"a Federal agency to give preference to recreational fishing, hunting, or shooting over other uses of Federal public land.\" This provision is an example of the apparent tension in the bill between directing federal agencies generally to allow more hunting, fishing, and shooting and to facilitate such activities procedurally, versus an effort to maintain some existing management structures and policies.", "Section 104(d)(2) directs agency heads to use existing authorities to lease or permit use of lands for shooting ranges and to designate specific lands for recreational shooting activities.

Instead, it refers to the Sporting Conservation Council, which was established a year earlier by the Department of the Interior.", "Section 104(c)(2) would direct agency heads to allow skilled volunteers to assist in managing wildlife populations on federal lands where hunting is banned, based on the best scientific data available. This would change the existing practice in which employees of Wildlife Services of the Department of Agriculture are used.

It is unlikely agencies have evaluated recreational shooting as broadly defined in this bill, when making existing land use plans. Additionally, it is unlikely that NPS or FWS used any new criteria for closure established by Title I when making evaluations for any restrictions on those three activities. To the extent that BLM and Forest Service have different planning criteria under the bill that appear consistent with existing practices, Title I would not pose a similar obstacle.

Either H.R. 4089 is intended to require immediate revision of land use plans where practices were not compatible, or many portions of the bill would not go into effect until the agency's plan came up for revision. In the case of some agency plans, those revisions may not occur for 15 years. Another interpretation is that the lands are open upon the law's enactment regardless of the current plan. This reading appears possible in the instance of BLM and Forest Service lands, in light of Section 104(d)'s directive that those lands \"shall be open ... unless the managing Federal agency acts to close lands.\"", "Additionally, it is not clear what parts of H.R. 4089 would trigger a plan revision. For example, the Title I definition of hunting, which includes trapping, could require all land management plans that allowed hunting but not trapping to be revised.

Another provides for public involvement, such as hearings where appropriate, to give federal, state, and local governments and the public \"notice and opportunity to comment upon and participate in the formulation of plans.\" Still another creates resource advisory councils to be involved in land use planning. In addition, other provisions direct BLM to coordinate planning efforts with other federal, state, local, and tribal planning activities. Other laws, regulations, and executive orders govern public participation in BLM planning as well.", "BLM land management plans generally are intended to govern management of agency lands over a 10- to 15-year period. They are to be revised or amended as new issues arise or conditions change. A plan revision replaces an existing plan, and is undertaken when a major portion of a plan or the entire plan no longer serves as a useful guide to land management. A plan amendment typically changes one or more of the terms, conditions, or decisions of an existing plan. Beginning in FY2001, BLM intensified efforts to update plans that were out of date, due to increased demands for energy resources, a rise in the use of off-highway vehicles, new listings of species under the Endangered Species Act, or a need to mitigate the effects of wildfires. Further, BLM has been developing new land use plans for additions to the National Landscape Conservation System. The agency estimates that since FY2001, 67 plans have been updated, while 48 are currently being updated and 44 need revision or amendment to meet changing demands and conditions.", "Forest Service", "Management for Hunting, Fishing, and Recreational Shooting", "The Forest Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) administers the National Forest System (NFS), which consists of 193 million acres in 44 states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, including national forests (155), national grasslands (20), and a tallgrass prairie. Approximately 2.9 million acres are officially designated as National Recreation Areas, 36.2 million acres as National Wilderness Areas, and 2.9 million acres as National Game Refuge and Wildlife Preserve Areas. Roughly 21% of lands within the boundaries of NFS lands are lands that are not federally owned or administered by the Forest Service. Those lands\u2014sometimes referred to as inholdings\u2014can cause difficulties for Forest Service land management because the agency does not regulate the development and use of the inholdings, and for hunters who may not know the boundaries between public and private property.", "The majority of NFS lands are open to hunting, shooting, fishing, and other recreational activities, although federal and state regulations and game limits apply. NFS lands are open to those activities unless specifically closed at the unit level. A few Forest Service sites are not open to hunting, as restricted by Congress when designating the area. While the Forest Service does not keep track of how much land is open to those activities, visitation data show that 7.6% and 8.2% of annual NFS recreational visitors list hunting or fishing, respectively, as their main activity. ", "State agencies manage the hunting, shooting, and fishing that occurs on NFS lands. Hunting, shooting, or fishing on inholdings require permission from the landowner and follow state laws. ", "Forest Service Land Management Planning", "Forest Service management goals for the national forests have evolved over time. The first management goals were established in 1897, when Congress stated that the forest reserves were \"to improve and protect the forest ... for the purpose of securing favorable conditions of water flows, and to furnish a continuous supply of timber for the use and necessities of the citizens of the United States.\" ", "Management goals were further defined in Section 1 of the Multiple Use-Sustained Yield Act of 1960 (MUSYA), which states that forests will be administered for \"outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, and wildlife and fish purposes\" in addition to the purposes established in 1897. MUSYA directs land and resource management of the national forests for the combination of uses that best meets the needs of the American people. ", "Forest Service planning and management are guided primarily by the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act (RPA) of 1974, as amended by the National Forest Management Act (NFMA) of 1976. NFMA requires the Forest Service to prepare a comprehensive land and resource management plan for each NFS unit, coordinated with the national RPA planning process. Planning regulations were first issued in 1979, and most recently revised in 2012.", "Under the planning regulations, the Forest Service will develop unit plans, known as land management plans, that describe resource management and projects and activities. Plans are subject to NEPA. A plan must be revised at least every 15 years. However, a plan may be revised sooner than the 15-year mark upon a determination that conditions have changed significantly. A plan may be amended at any time. The Forest Service reports there are 127 land management plans for NFS lands, 68 of which are past due for revision. Most of the past due plans were developed between 1983 and 1993 and should have been revised between 1998 and 2008. The Forest Service reports that efforts to produce a new planning rule over the past decade contributed to the delay in plan revisions.", "National Park Service", "Management for Hunting, Fishing, and Recreational Shooting", "The National Park Service (NPS) manages lands within the national park system. The park system includes 84 million acres of land in 397 designated units, including 58 national parks and 75 national monuments. Other types of park units include memorials, battlefields and military parks, historic sites and parks, lakeshores and seashores, recreation areas, reserves, preserves, rivers and trails, and other designations. Sixty-one NPS units are open to hunting, and 200 units allow fishing. NPS has the often contradictory mission of facilitating access and serving visitors while protecting and preserving unimpaired for future generations the natural, historic, and cultural integrity of the lands and resources it manages. NPS typically has specific management direction in the statutory authorization for each unit. ", "While each park may have more specific provisions based on its statutory authorization, NPS regulations establish general management guidelines for all park units. Park Superintendents have the authority to close areas of the park to specific uses consistent with federal law and administrative policy. Fishing, generally, is allowed in national park units \"in accordance with the laws and regulations of the State within whose exterior boundaries a park area or portion thereof is located.\" Like other public uses, fishing is allowed to the extent it is an appropriate use , meaning it is \"suitable, proper, or fitting for a particular park, or to a particular location within a park.\" ", "NPS regulations prohibit hunting and trapping except in park areas where specifically authorized by federal law. Hunting is not defined in the regulations. Additionally, even where authorized, hunting may take place only after NPS has determined that the activity is an appropriate use and is \"consistent with public safety and enjoyment, and sound resource management principles.\" Some park units where federal law allows hunting include Fire Island National Seashore, Lake Chelan Cascades National Recreation Area, Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, Big Cypress National Preserve, and Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area. ", "The NPS regulations do not address recreational shooting specifically. However, the regulations restrict special events , which reasonably could include war reenactments, field trials, or shooting competitions, to those that have \"a meaningful association between the park area and the events, and the observance contributes to visitor understanding of the significance of the park area, and a permit therefor has been issued by the superintendent.\" A permit may be denied for events that would: injure or damage park resources; be contrary to the purposes of the park, such as unreasonably interfere with the peace and tranquility maintained in wilderness, natural, historic, or commemorative zones; unreasonably interfere with park administration; substantially impair the operation of concessioners; present a clear and present danger to the public; or result in significant conflict with other existing uses. Thus, park units appear to be the only types of federal lands where uses such as recreational shooting may be restricted due to noise.", "NPS Land Management Planning", "NPS management is directed by three main statutes: the Organic Act of 1916, the General Authorities Act of 1970, and the National Parks and Recreation Act of 1978. Under the National Parks and Recreation Act, NPS must prepare management plans for park units. Goals and practices for management are within the NPS Management Policies. NPS prepares General Management Plans (GMPs), \"a broad umbrella document that sets the long-term goals for the park,\" for overall park unit management. These are prepared every 10 to 15 years, but may be updated earlier if circumstances warrant. Implementation Plans are prepared for specific projects or resources. NPS is required to identify and document the environmental impacts of its land management planning decisions pursuant to its guidelines implementing NEPA.", "Of the 397 park units, 375 have GMPs. Approximately 50 new or revised GMPs are in development. All units are expected to have a GMP, except for one unit on an Indian reservation, which site is closed to the public.", "Fish and Wildlife Service", "Management for Hunting, Fishing, and Recreational Shooting", "The National Wildlife Refuge System (Refuge System) is administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) of the Department of the Interior. The Refuge System has 149.0 million acres; a small fraction of the Refuge System (3.5 million acres) consists of Waterfowl Production Areas (WPAs), managed for breeding habitat of waterfowl. In addition to the Refuge System, FWS manages another 157.1 million acres, consisting largely of marine national monuments established under the Antiquities Act. Of the 594 wildlife refuges and WPAs, 365 are open to some form of hunting. Hunting closures occur for reasons including human safety, species conservation, and lack of huntable species. ", "All FWS lands are managed primarily for the conservation of animals and plants. Other uses in the Refuge System\u2014hunting, fishing, recreation, timber harvest, grazing, etc.\u2014are permitted to the extent that they are compatible with the purposes for which the refuge was created. The Refuge System resembles the Forest Service or BLM lands in allowing some commercial uses, but in certain cases, other uses (e.g., public access) can be substantially more restrictive than for NPS lands. ", "The National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997 addressed overarching refuge management controversies facing FWS. A key provision of this law designated \"compatible wildlife-dependent recreational uses involving hunting, fishing, wildlife observation and photography, and environmental education and interpretation as priority public uses of the Refuge System.\" It also required that priority public uses must \"receive enhanced consideration over other general public uses in planning and management within the System.\" The law continued to provide that activities that are not wildlife-dependent (e.g., grazing, growing hay, etc.) may be permitted, provided they are compatible with wildlife. Recreational shooting is not considered a wildlife-dependent activity and therefore is not a priority use of refuge lands.", "FWS Wildlife Refuge Planning", "The statutory basis for Refuge System planning is Section 4 of the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act (Refuge Act). Hunting is on the short list of wildlife-dependent recreation activities and therefore is a priority use of a refuge. Section 4 requires refuge managers to document and describe \"existing and potential opportunities for wildlife-dependent recreation\" in their land management planning, which includes creating a Comprehensive Conservation Plan (CCP). Explicit directives for CCP development are contained in the FWS Service Manual, which states that CCPs must prepare goals for \"compatible wildlife-dependent recreation\" and also map desired future conditions for such activities. To an extent, the planning requirements of H.R. 4089 appear to be congruent with the analysis already undertaken by FWS. However, because the Refuge Act does not define hunting or fishing, H.R. 4089 might expand the scope of a CCP by (1) including trapping and field trials under its definition of hunting; (2) not clearly excluding commercial fishing from recreational fishing; and (3) adding recreational shooting (as defined) as an activity to be analyzed in such plans. ", "The CCPs process includes developing background information, preparing alternatives, and specifying one alternative as preferred, all subject to public notice and comments. FWS responds to comments about the draft plans, and issues a final plan. All refuge plans are to be completed within 15 years of when the Refuge Act was amended\u2014by October 9, 2012\u2014and revised at least every 15 years thereafter or as warranted. As plans are being prepared, FWS must publish a notice in the Federal Register of the opportunity for public comment. In addition, individual refuges post planning documents and notices on their websites. ", "Of the 554 units in the Refuge System at the time the Refuge Act was amended, 429 have completed CCPs. There are 109 plans under development; 16 CCPs have not yet begun the planning process, but are expected to begin soon. It is expected that all but 50 or so of the units will be completed by the October 9, 2012, deadline."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
