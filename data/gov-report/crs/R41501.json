Practices targeted have included waivers of layover rules, use of structured and closed special rules, and waivers of committee assignment limitations. The purpose of this report is to provide Members with an analysis of House legislative rules and practices, and committee organization and procedures, that could be changed in the 112th Congress. Some analyses respond to bipartisan Member concerns over the House's legislative management, others to the needs of leaders in managing such a large body.", "Change to legislative procedures and to committee organization in the House of Representatives can be achieved in a number of ways, including the opening-day rules resolution, freestanding resolutions, the Speaker's announced policies, party rules, and majority-party leadership commitments.", "A House rule or set of rules might be drafted a number of ways. Questions for a proponent of a rules change include: What is the balance being sought between deliberation and decision making? What leader or group of Members will be empowered by a change, or will the House be the decision maker? Will an action be allowed, forbidden, or made conditional? How will the rule be enforced? How could party rules supplement or supplant an existing or new rule?", "Numerous House rules address the committee system, including structure, membership, jurisdiction and referral, and procedures. Numerous Democratic Caucus and Republican Conference rules and decisions on committees supplement or even circumvent House rules to ensure the majority party's dominance of committees' policymaking and to organize committees to reflect the majority party's values. The number, jurisdiction, size, and party ratios of committees are important for these reasons. In addition, as the number of waivers and temporary assignments has expanded, the average number of assignments for Members has risen. These attributes of the committee system, and others, could be changed if Members wish to do so.", "The means by which legislation is developed has become an issue in and of itself in recent Congresses. Members of both parties, whether their party has been in the majority or the minority, have criticized departures from \"regular order\" and the development of leadership alternatives outside of and subsequent to the committee process. The evolution of rules and practices in the House in the past 25 years, however, has favored decision making and efficiency. Members seem now to be asking whether the House favors decision making too much over deliberation? Whether the minority has been excluded too much from influencing legislative outcomes?", "Because important legislation, including conference reports and amendments between the houses, is almost always considered in the House chamber under a special rule reported by the Rules Committee\u2014the \"arm of the leadership\"\u2014the use of structured and closed rules has become the principal means by which the House makes decisions efficiently.

Through more than two centuries, the House and Senate through laws, rules, precedents, and practices have added other complexities to the lawmaking process, although with the objective of ensuring and balancing deliberation and decision making. Moreover, in that same time frame, the openness of Congress to viewing and influence by the citizenry and their interests has ensured that Congress is, whatever the nature and duration of advocacy for and against specific propositions, ultimately politically responsive."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "I. 2.1.1. Deliberations vs. Decision Making", "paragraphs": ["House rules take into account the large number of Members, and have favored decision making over deliberation. When a Member stands to speak in the House, he or she must be recognized for that purpose by the chair and then speaks subject to a time limit, frequently five minutes or less. The standing rules restrict what a Member may do and when the Member may do it in the course of House proceedings, and allow the majority to vote to further restrict debate time, the amendment procedure, the availability of motions, and other legislative procedures from what the standing rules permit. If it votes together, a majority will be able to reach a decision on its preferred legislative outcome within a limited amount of time.", "Changes to House rules tend to keep in place the rules' decision-making bias, even when enhancing the House's deliberation. For example, when the Republicans organized the House in the 104 th Congress (1995-1997), their rules package ensured the minority of a right to make a motion to recommit with instructions. This opportunity to offer an alternative had eroded in the preceding decades. However, the rules change did not increase the normal debate time on a motion to recommit with instructions beyond the 10 minutes (or one hour, upon the demand of the majority floor manager) in the earlier version of the rule.", "A rule or a rules change can add to deliberation or enhance decision making, although such changes rarely depart from the existing features of House rules. So, for example, when the House in 1971 first allowed debate on a motion to recommit with instructions, it added to the House's deliberation. However, in keeping with the feature of limiting time, the rules change allowed just 10 minutes for debate, equally divided between a proponent and an opponent. The House, on the other hand, enhanced its decision making with a rules change in the 104 th Congress that allowed the majority leader to make a motion for the Committee of the Whole to rise and report after an appropriations bill had been read for amendment. In keeping with the feature of majority decision making, the House could preclude the consideration of limitation amendments if it agreed to the majority leader's motion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "I. 2.1.2. Ease or Difficulty of Passing Legislation", "paragraphs": ["A rule or rules change can make it easier or harder to pass legislation. In 1979, for example, the House first adopted a rule to provide that, when the House agreed to a budget resolution that required an increase in the statutory limit on the public debt, a vote to agree to the budget resolution also constituted passage of a joint resolution increasing the statutory limit, an engrossment to be prepared by the clerk of the House. An argument was made that Congress had no choice but to periodically raise the limit on the debt, which resulted from numerous congressional decisions, and the House should therefore not have to spend time trying to pass a debt limit measure. The House repealed this rule in the 107 th Congress (2001-2003), but reinstated it in the 108 th Congress (2003-2005).", "In contrast, the House in the 104 th Congress (1995-1997) sought to make it more difficult to pass a measure \"carrying a Federal income tax rate increase\" by adopting a rule to require a three-fifths vote for such a measure.

Efficiency vs. Deliberation", "paragraphs": ["A rule or rules change might favor efficiency over deliberation.

While some Members argued that these changes would lead to a reduction in the amount of time that Members were in the House chamber during debate, other Members argued that there was too much work to do in committees, with constituents, in other meetings, and in other ways to be constantly interrupted with quorum calls and roll-calls. These changes are now accepted as normal House procedures. In addition, motions to suspend the rules\u2014where debate is limited to 40 minutes and no amendments from the floor are allowed\u2014are now in order on all Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, the current state of an evolution beginning in the 1970s when such motions were in order only on the first and third Mondays of a month."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "I. 2.1.4.

Because of the organization of this committee, this rule favors the majority generally and the majority leadership specifically. Majority members of the committee outnumber minority members by a two-to-one-plus-one ratio, and the majority members are appointed by the Speaker. The Speaker and majority leadership determine what legislation will be considered by the House, and work with the majority members of the Rules Committee to tailor a special rule to accomplish the majority's legislative goals.", "Rule XII, pertaining to the referral of measures, provides specific direction to the Speaker, but it also accords the Speaker discretion, without review, to make a number of decisions related to referral. The Speaker may or may not designate a primary committee, may choose when to make an additional referral and how to do so, may impose time limits initially or later, and may impose other conditions that the Speaker deems appropriate. While an erroneous referral may be corrected, the discretion exercised by the Speaker may not be challenged.", "Certain rules empower or favor a leader other than the Speaker. In Rule XXI, for example, the majority leader is authorized to make a motion for the Committee of the Whole to rise and report a general appropriations bill that has been read for amendment. The majority leader would presumably not make such a motion unless the Speaker also favored it, but he or she might make the motion although some majority Members hoped to offer amendments that would be cut off by adoption of the motion. Rule IX, pertaining to questions of privilege, favors the majority and minority leaders. If one of them raises a question of the privileges of the House, it is privileged and accorded immediate consideration. A Member, Delegate, or the Resident Commissioner may also raise a question of the privileges of the House, but it is privileged only at a time designated by the Speaker within two legislative days, once the Member has given notice.", "The motion to recommit is the minority's motion.

How Standing Rules May Be Implemented", "paragraphs": ["Through adoption of a special rule, agreeing to unanimous consent, or failure of any Member to make a point of order alleging a violation of a House rule, the House may adapt, circumvent, or ignore a House rule. It is difficult to enforce a rule as written if a majority of Members wish to operate in a different manner in the consideration of a measure or matter, or if no Member will object to a unanimous consent request or make a point of order.", "Rules, however, contain a variety of mechanisms that seek to ensure that they are implemented as written, including\u2014", "A specific prohibition in a rule that is important to a large number of Members may act as a deterrent to circumvention, for example, Rule XIII's proscription of the Rules Committee from reporting a special rule prohibiting the motion to recommit. The recommit motion is of paramount importance to the minority. The process attached to a rule might allow a waiver of the rule by a majority vote. For example, the Unfunded Mandates Act ( P.L. 104-4 ) requires unfunded mandates information to be included in committee reports and prohibits consideration of a measure if the cost of an unfunded mandate exceeds a certain amount. If a special rule proposes to waive these requirements and a point of order is made against the special rule for this reason, the House may waive the point of order by agreeing to a question of consideration. The process attached to a rule might allow standing rules to be circumvented by a supermajority vote. The most common procedure used in the House to pass legislation, for example, is the suspension of the rules procedure. It allows a motion to suspend all of the rules of the House but requires a two-thirds vote to agree to the motion. In the instance of waiving a specific rule, Rule XIII requires a two-thirds vote to consider a special rule on the same day that the Rules Committee reports it, thus dispensing with the so-called one-day layover rule applicable to special rules. In many circumstances, without any special authorization in the rule, a Member may make a point of order to allege that a rule is being violated. Once the chair rules on the point of order, either sustaining it or overruling it, a Member may normally appeal the chair's ruling. Absent a point of order, it is possible that the chair might still make a decision or ruling that is subject to an appeal. For example, when a question of the privileges of the House is called up, the Speaker makes a determination whether a valid question has been raised. The Speaker's determination is subject to appeal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "I. 2.5.

The House makes committee assignments by agreeing to one or more committee assignment resolutions presented by the two parties. If a Member is listed for membership on three committees in these resolutions, the House by its vote tacitly waives its rule for that Member.", "Party rules also play an important role in the organization of committees, particularly in the organization of each committees' subcommittees, the selection of subcommittee chairs, and the assignment of committee members to subcommittees. Democratic Caucus rules were the source of the Subcommittee Bill of Rights that enhanced the responsibilities and authority of subcommittees in the 1970s and 1980s.", "Prior to floor consideration of major legislation, either party might convene a meeting of its members to discuss the legislation.

These exceptions were made so that the majority party could maintain control of all the committees. In the 83 rd Congress, however, when the Republicans had a 'paper thin' majority of only 7 seats in the House, 18 Republicans were given second committee assignments so as to enable them to control all the standing committees of the House. This necessary departure from the one-committee-assignment rule apparently marked the beginning of the breakdown of that rule, for an examination of committee assignments in the 2 d session of the 85 th Congress showed that 118 Members of the House had 2 or more committee assignments in 1958. In addition to the four excepted committees mentioned above, five more had been added to the list of those groups upon which some Representatives had second seats: Education and Labor, Interior and Insular Affairs, Merchant Marine and Fisheries, Public Works, and Veterans' Affairs.", "Growth in committee seats took a substantial jump in the 94 th Congress (1975-1977).

With the 1974 election of the Watergate class of House Democrats, Democrats won 291 seats to the Republicans' 144 seats. In preparations for organizing the 94 th Congress, the Democratic Caucus approved a proposal that committees should reflect the 2-to-1 House majority by having a 2-to-1-plus-1 majority on all committees, except for the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct.

Moreover, the role of committees and the structure of floor consideration of legislation has continued to evolve over the course of Congress's more than two centuries of lawmaking.

In too many instances, we no longer have legislators; we just have voters.", "Then-Democratic Leader Pelosi also defined a broader concept of regular order in 2006 as a part of \"A New Direction for America.\" The principles enunciated there have since been articulated by Members of both parties in House debate and in other forums and have informed resolutions that Members have introduced to amend House rules. Leader Pelosi defined regular order thus: ", "\"Bills should be developed following full hearings and open subcommittee and committee markups, with appropriate referrals to other committees. Members should have at least 24 hours to examine a bill prior to consideration at the subcommittee level.\" \"Bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open, full, and fair debate consisting of a full amendment process that grants the Minority the right to offer its alternatives, including a substitute.\" \"Members should have at least 24 hours to examine bill and conference report text prior to floor consideration. Rules governing floor debate must be reported before 10 p.m. for a bill to be considered the following day.\" \"Floor votes should be completed within 15 minutes, with the customary 2-minute extension to accommodate Members' ability to reach the House Chamber to cast their votes. No vote shall be held open in order to manipulate the outcome.\" \"House-Senate conference committees should hold regular meetings (at least weekly) of all conference committee Members. All duly-appointed conferees should be informed of the schedule of conference committee activities in a timely manner and given ample opportunity for input and debate as decisions are made toward final bill language.\"", "An observer might ask if these principles describe any period in the modern House. They could describe the House in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, especially after electronic voting was introduced. But, other characteristics, such as the power of committee chairs and the independence of the Rules Committee, had a very large impact on the legislative agenda in those years and were the target of earlier change or reform efforts. Increasingly in the last 25 years, however, ", "the number of hearings has decreased, which has also reduced that form of oversight; markups have shortened, with the amendment in the nature of a substitute, on which the previous question is in order after brief debate, becoming the typical markup vehicle; the number of annual and multiyear authorizations considered has decreased; structured and closed rules have become the norm, with ever-fewer opportunities to offer minority amendments, substitute amendments, and second-degree amendments; leadership has become more engaged in detailed crafting of the legislative vehicle considered on the floor; layover requirements have been waived, and suspension of the rules, temporarily allowed in the 108 th Congress on Wednesdays in addition to Mondays and Tuesdays, is now permanently allowed on those three days and on occasion, as permitted by special rules, on additional days of the week; partisan voting has increased, to the extent that each party complains that the other party's Members automatically dismiss its ideas, amendments, and legislation; conferences have become less common, while reconciling differences through amendments between the houses has become more common; and fewer substantive bills and joint resolutions have become law, with changes or additions to existing law aggregated in a few lengthy, complex public laws.", "The principles of regular order articulated by the leaders, then, seem to represent ideals or goals that favor deliberation and Member and minority participation in the legislative process. They are useful in identifying key stages of the legislative process where Members might wish to consider changes that enhance deliberation. The evolution of rules and practices in the House in the past 25 years, however, has favored decision making and efficiency. This evolution can be partially attributed to a shortened workweek resulting from Members' desire to be present in their districts each weekend and for longer periods close to national holidays and at other times, and partially attributed to the numerous other exogenous and endogenous influences on the role of a Member of Congress, such as campaign fund raising, the 24-hour news cycle, the rise of electronic media, and the ubiquity and role of lobbyists and grassroots organizations. Members might ask whether the House in recent years has favored decision making too much over deliberation? Whether the minority has been excluded too much from influencing legislative outcomes?", "There are different ways to achieve or enforce in general the principles of regular order on the floor identified by Leader Boehner or Leader Pelosi, other than continuing the House's current legislative management and forcing dissenters to vote against special rules. For example, House rules could be changed to create points of order to enforce specific attributes of regular order, and a question of consideration could be allowed to decide such a point of order. Use of a question of consideration could also be clarified for situations where regular order has been breached, absent the creation of a new point of order. Proposed violations of regular order could also be subject to discussion in or decision by the majority-party caucus or conference. The Speaker, in policy announcements or as a condition of election by the majority party, could make specific commitments regarding regular order.", "Most issues of regular order, however, arise with the ad hoc changes to standing rules contained in provisions of special rules.

The former is an instruction to a committee to take an action related to the measure under consideration.

Pre-filing would seem to disadvantage the minority at the same time that it gives ample notice to the majority. The minority's disadvantage is, in part, that the choice of what amendment to include a motion to recommit with instructions may depend on what amendments have been agreed to or defeated during the amendment process. Pre-filing also allows the majority leadership to whip its membership, probably further restricting the minority's role in the processing of legislation. Postponing consideration of a motion to recommit with instructions, once offered, by rule or at the initiative of the Speaker, would allow the minority to decide on the motion's content at the end of the amendment process.

As with one-minute speeches, make time for the consideration of measures involving appreciation and recognition by unanimous consent available at the Speaker's discretion on any day of the week. Alternately, provide a different form of suspension of the rules for measures involving appreciation and recognition\u201410 minutes of debate, no floor amendments, passage by voice vote.

Would it be desirable to prevent controversial or important measures from being considered under the suspension of the rules procedure?

Should the Speaker continue to be solely responsible for determining which measures might be considered under the suspension of the rules procedure?

Any change involving communications between the majority and minority could be done through the Speaker's announced policies or through a statement or commitment, such as through a scripted floor colloquy, between majority and minority leadership.

A question of the privileges of the House is a proposition \"affecting the rights of the House and the safety, dignity, and integrity of its proceedings.\"", "If offered by the majority or minority leader, such a resolution takes precedence over all other business except the motion to adjourn. If offered by any other Member, a Delegate, or the Resident Commissioner, the resolution attains that precedence \"only at a time or place, designated by the Speaker, in the legislative schedule within two legislative days after the day\" on which the proponent announces the resolution to the House. Several questions concerning this rule might be raised.", "Should the distinction continue to exist between resolutions offered by the majority or minority leader and others? Should there be additional distinctions, such as for other party leaders, committee chairs or ranking minority members, or others? Or, should the Speaker be authorized to establish the time for the House to consider such a resolution no matter who offers it? Or, should such resolutions have immediate precedence no matter who offers it? Providing the Speaker with authority to schedule consideration of any such resolution would presumably be advantageous to the majority in managing the House's agenda and schedule, alerting majority Members to the existence of a resolution, and preparing for debate if debate might be desirable. As their party leaders, both Representative Pelosi and Representative Boehner made use of the leaders' prerogative. Eliminating the distinction to rank precedence to a resolution offered by any Member, a Delegate, or the Resident Commissioner could invite increased use of such resolutions.", "Should the majority and minority leaders be authorized to appoint designees who could offer resolutions having immediate precedence? This change would be a relaxation of the rule, but not to the extent of allowing a resolution offered by any Member, a Delegate, or the Resident Commissioner to have precedence.

It, too, could result in additional resolutions.", "Should the proponent of such a resolution (or, alternately, the majority and minority leaders) be guaranteed up to one hour's debate by, for example, disallowing a motion disposing of the question, such as a motion to table, before the expiration of one hour's debate or the yielding back of the proponent's and opponent's balance of time? Or, might a proponent and an opponent each have five minutes at the time of the announcement or at the later time designated by the Speaker, before a motion disposing of the question is offered? One benefit of this kind of change might be that the minority could air its grievance in an official forum, rather than solely through media coverage, and the majority could, if it desired, have the opportunity to rebut the grievance on the House floor, rather than relying on media coverage to deliver its perspective and to do so accurately and completely. Such an end could also be achieved by the majority's forbearance in offering a debate-ending motion on minority resolutions, at least on a new resolution that is not repetitive of earlier resolutions. A change of this type would be a relaxation of House rules to allow Members an increased opportunity to discuss a matter on the floor.

House Schedule", "paragraphs": ["Many aspects of service in Congress have changed in little more than a generation and have had an impact on the House's schedule. Members have taken advantage of the convenience of commercial air service to be present in home districts nearly every weekend and nearly every district work period. Their families most often remain in their district homes rather than move to the Washington, DC, area, and Members feel they cannot afford representationally or politically to be absent from their district for more than a few days at a time. Seemingly, the only House activity that entices Members as a whole to travel to Washington and stay is recorded votes. These developments have impinged on the congressional workweek, with Members typically arriving in Washington Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning and departing Thursday night or Friday midday.", "Members also now have different responsibilities while they are in Washington. Campaigns used to be relatively inexpensive so that fund raising largely occurred in a Representative's second year. Members did not necessarily contribute funds to each other's campaigns or to their party committees, or sponsor fund-raising events for their party colleagues. Lobbyists were far fewer in number; there were few grassroots campaigns; interest groups did not necessarily keep track of Members' voting during a Congress, even if they issued a \"report card\" prior to an election; and public and media relations were a small part of even large entities' congressional relations. Members were called on for fewer speeches and other appearances. Hearings and markups typically lasted several days, often over the course of several weeks. The constricted workweek along with changes in the political and policymaking environment have changed how Members spend their time when present in Washington.", "Use of floor time has also changed. In the modern era, the 1880 rule on suspensions was updated in the 93 rd Congress (1973-1975) to make suspension motions in order on the first and third Mondays of each month and the Tuesdays following these Mondays. Since the 108 th Congress (2003-2005), suspension motions have been in order every Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Open rules accounted for more than two-thirds of the special rules adopted by the House as late as the 98 th Congress (1983-1985) and for more than half of special rules even in the 106 th Congress (1999-2001). There have been no open rules in the 111 th Congress. Recorded votes were first allowed in the Committee of the Whole in 1971. Other rules changes have allowed votes to be clustered and the time for a vote to be reduced to 5 minutes after a 15-minute vote and restricted the opportunities for quorum calls. Practices have evolved as well so that, for example, amendments between the houses seem to be preferred to conference reports, and both conference reports and amendments between the houses come to the floor pursuant to a special rule. Fewer, bigger bills seem to make it through the legislative process, and ever more representational legislation seems to be considered under the suspension of the rules procedure.", "As explained earlier, Leader Boehner and Leader Pelosi, when each was in the minority, called for changes to the use of House floor time, both expressing support for a more open amendment process in House consideration of legislation. Both Leader Boehner and Republican Whip Cantor have proposed reining in time spent on measures considered under the suspension of the rules procedure. Options related to these proposals were addressed above. In their statements just before and since the 2010 election, Republican leaders have emphasized committee work, especially oversight.", "What, however, are some options that might be available to deal with the length of the workweek and the length of the workday? ", "The majority leadership works within several parameters. First, Members, especially from Western states, prefer to travel Monday during the day and Thursday nights in order to have the greatest amount of time in their districts. Second, the potential of recorded votes entices Members as a whole to arrive in Washington and stay; committee sessions scheduled before or after recorded votes for a week might be canceled. Third, leaders must try to make time available for committee meetings so that activities on the House floor will not compete for Members' attention. Fourth, daily sessions that go too late interfere with Members' family life, whether their family has moved to the Washington area or there is substantial telephone time to talk to their children back home. Members over the phone help their children with their homework, read stories, exchange news of the day, pray, and discuss other matters.", "A schedule that concentrates committee and floor activities on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays best responds to Members' desire to be in their home districts, even if they travel from a Western state. This schedule favors the representational component of a Member's service. It constrains both committee and floor time, however, spreading Members' time over possibly two or more committee and subcommittee meetings and a floor session each day within a very short workweek. It also probably discourages committees and subcommittees from scheduling at least some meetings.", "A schedule of a five-day workweek maximizes the time available for legislative work, although one might wonder whether leadership could consistently identify five days of recorded votes each week so that Members would stay in Washington. This schedule favors the legislative component of a Member's service, particularly their committee work. But, it leaves Members with as little as 24 hours in their home district, almost necessitating them to move their families here. Members are also likely to object that they would be disconnected from their constituents.", "A schedule of a four-day workweek is a compromise that increases both the amount of committee and floor time available, compared to a schedule with work concentrated on three days, but still allows Members at least two full days in their districts, although the turnaround from Friday night travel to a Monday morning travel (or Thursday night and Sunday morning) disadvantages Members from Western states more.", "A proposal with which there was some experience in the Senate in the late 1980s and early 1990s is that of three weeks of work followed by a one-week home work period. The Senate's experience with five-day workweeks followed by a one-week home-state work period was that there was pressure not to schedule votes on Mondays and, by the early 1990s, workweeks had again shortened. It, too, would probably have necessitated Members moving their families to the Washington, DC, area, and would likely be objectionable to Members for reducing their constituent contact. Nonetheless, such a schedule offers predictability, allows time for a full week of legislative work, lessens the need for evening sessions, and provides longer, uninterrupted, regular periods for home-district work.", "These various proposals, and additional variations that could be identified, can be combined in different ways. For example, there could be a repeating pattern of a five-day week, followed by a four-day week, followed by a three-day week, with the days in session manipulated to maximize the number of long weekends. The pattern could keep repeating, or the fourth week could be a home-district work period. There might also be months with longer workweeks and months with shorter workweeks.", "The normal pattern could alternatively be four-day weeks, with the days in session shifted to maximize the number of long weekends.", "The consideration of legislation by unanimous consent and suspension of the rules could be restricted solely to Mondays, requiring Members to be present during the day only if they wished to speak on a measure or sponsored a measure but then arrive to vote that evening.", "Wednesday has long been the day on which the House plans to meet into the evening.

Should conferences be resurrected as a principal form of reconciling differences in legislation passed by the House and Senate? They are inefficient and time-consuming, and decision making is delegated to a relatively small number of Members representing each chamber. On the other hand, amendments between the houses, or conferences that meet largely to endorse decisions made by party and committee leaders, delegate decision making to an even smaller number of Members. The current system is a more efficient system for the membership at large, but it means a less representative group settles differences between the two chambers. A recommendation by Leader Pelosi was: \"House-Senate conference committees should hold regular meetings (at least weekly) of all conference committee Members.\" The recommendation also anticipated all conferees' involvement in conference decision making.
