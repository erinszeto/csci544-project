There were, however, reform proposals to replace the income tax with an alternative system or abolish the current system altogether.", "In the 113th Congress, then-chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means Dave Camp introduced the Tax Reform Act of 2014 (H.R. 1). This legislative proposal was preceded by several tax reform discussion drafts, the first of which was introduced during the 112th Congress.

Recent tax reform proposals seek to lower tax rates, broaden the tax base, and provide a simpler and fairer tax system overall. The difficulty with tax reform, however, is agreeing on the crucial details needed to refresh the tax system. How far should rates be lowered? Which tax provisions should be modified or eliminated? Should the reformed tax system be income-based or consumption-based? What are the objectives regarding federal deficits and the debt? To assist Congress as it continues to debate tax reform options, this report provides a review of recent legislative proposals introduced since the 113 th Congress. ", "Policymakers often speak of the goal to achieve comprehensive reform of the entire tax code. If comprehensive tax reform is not deemed feasible, Congress could choose to consider reforms to certain parts of the code as an alternative. For example, the corporate tax system could be reformed first and the individual tax system, and perhaps payroll tax system, at a later date. Similarly, Congress could choose to reform only portions of the corporate system, such as just the international aspects of the corporate system. Alternatively, Congress could choose to evaluate business-only options, which would involve changes to the corporate system and portions of the individual system under which \"pass-through\" business income generated by sole proprietors, partnerships, limited liability companies, and S corporations is taxed.", "Before reviewing recent reform proposals, it may be helpful to review the three criteria by which economists often evaluate tax policy\u2014equity, efficiency, and simplicity. Equity concerns the fairness of a particular tax system. Economists rely on two concepts of equity\u2014horizontal equity and vertical equity. Horizontal equity holds that taxpayers with similar incomes should face similar tax burdens. Vertical equity examines the distribution of tax burdens across different income groups. Under an ability-to-pay standard, vertical equity suggests that taxpayers in higher income groups should pay more. Efficiency relates to the degree to which the tax system distorts economic decision making. Low marginal tax rates applied to a broad tax base, with few exclusions or exemptions, tend be more economically efficient. S implicity considers the amount of resources that must be committed to administering, enforcing, and complying with the tax system. Tradeoffs may exist between these three objectives.
