This scrutiny led to consideration of major amendments to the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA), which established and authorized the CPSC in 1972 in response to growing concerns about protecting the public from unsafe, defective consumer products. Jurisdiction over the administration and enforcement of several existing consumer safety statutes was transferred from other agencies to and consolidated under the CPSC. However, in the years since its establishment, the staff and resources of the CPSC have been considerably reduced, leading many observers to doubt its ability to fulfill its mission effectively.", "Consequently, Congress considered major reform legislation to address organizational and systemic deficiencies. Legislative proposals in the 110th Congress included provisions targeting specific consumer product defects and hazards.

This report provides an overview of the prior authority of the CPSC to establish consumer product safety standards and to inspect, recall, and restrict importation of unsafe consumer products, and summarizes changes made by the CPSIA to reform the CPSC and strengthen enforcement of consumer product safety standards.", "The Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a72051 et seq.) established and authorized the CPSC in 1972 in response to growing concerns about protecting the public from unsafe, defective consumer products. However, in the years since its establishment, the staff and resources of the CPSC have been considerably reduced to the detriment of its ability to fulfill its mission effectively. Aside from the issue of adequacy of resources, the highly publicized recalls of children's toys in 2007 focused attention on alleged weaknesses in the CPSA and the authority of the CPSC to establish consumer product safety standards and to inspect, recall domestically, and block imports of unsafe consumer products.", "The CPSC is the central, federal authority for the promotion and enforcement of consumer product safety. The system is designed to be a collaborative effort among the CPSC, the industries producing the broad range of consumer products, and the consuming public. The CPSC researches and promotes best practices for the industries, producing guidelines for manufacturers, importers, distributors and retailers. Although the CPSA authorizes the CPSC to promulgate mandatory consumer product safety standards, it mandates reliance upon voluntary standards whenever compliance with voluntary standards would eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury and substantial compliance with voluntary standards is likely.", "Besides the CPSA, the CPSC also administers several other statutes whose authorities and functions were transferred to the CPSC upon its creation. The Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71261 et seq.) provides for warning/informational labeling of hazardous substances and for the banning of certain hazardous substances for which labeling would not provide adequate protection for the public against the potential hazards posed by the substances. The Flammable Fabrics Act (FFA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71191 et seq.) provides for the establishment of safety standards regarding fabric flammability. It also prohibits the manufacture, sale, importation, transportation, or delivery in commerce of a product, fabric, or related material or of a product made of a fabric or related material that does not comply with the standards and deems that such practices constitute unfair methods of competition and unfair and deceptive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Poison Prevention Packaging Act (PPPA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71471 et seq.) authorizes the CPSC to establish special packaging standards for a household substance if such standards are required to protect children from serious injury or illness from using, handling or ingesting such substance, with exceptions for noncomplying packages for elderly/handicapped persons and packaging at the direction of a licensed medical practitioner. The Refrigerator Safety Act (RSA,15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71211) prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of any household refrigerator that does not conform with certain safety standards.", "Prior to amendment by the CPSIA, some of these statutes provided for powers that were similar but not identical to those established under the CPSA. Therefore, the regulatory procedures and other actions which the CPSC is authorized to carry out with regard to the products regulated under these other statutes differed (and may still differ in some respects) from those authorized under the CPSA. Before the CPSIA, the CPSC could choose to regulate under the CPSA a consumer product that could be regulated sufficiently under these other statutes only if the CPSC determined that it was in the public interest to do so. The differences among the different statutory standards and procedures and enforcement authority arguably led to inconsistency in the enforcement of different product standards. For example, injunctive enforcement authority for states attorneys general is expressly provided by the FHSA and the FFA, but was not expressly provided by the CPSA before amendment by the CPSIA. The apparent ambiguity of the CPSA on this point led to amendments in the CPSIA to provide express authority.", "The CPSC has the authority to establish consumer product safety standards for consumer products generally, defined as \"any article or component part thereof, produced or distributed (i) for sale to a consumer for use in or around a permanent or temporary household or residence, a school, in recreation, or otherwise, or (ii) for the personal use, consumption or enjoyment of a consumer in or around a permanent or temporary household or residence, a school, in recreation, or otherwise.\" There are express exemptions for products covered under other statutes, including tobacco and tobacco products, motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment, pesticides, firearms/antique firearms and ammunition/supplies (except for fireworks), aircraft and components, boats and other marine vessels, drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, food, or any article which is not customarily produced or distributed for sale to, or use or consumption by, or enjoyment of, a consumer. The CPSC also has jurisdiction over amusement rides that are not permanently fixed to a site but rather are part of a travelling carnival or show, but does not have jurisdiction over rides that are permanently fixed to a particular site. Furthermore, the CPSC has no jurisdiction to regulate a particular consumer product if the risk of injury associated with that product could be eliminated or sufficiently reduced by actions taken under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (Occupational Safety and Health Administration), under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (the Energy Research and Development Administration [now Department of Energy] and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission), or under the Clean Air Act (the Environmental Protection Agency). The CPSC has no authority to regulate any risk of injury associated with electronic product radiation emitted from an electronic product if such risk may be regulated under the Public Health Act (the Food and Drug Administration).", "Manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and importers are obligated to report consumer product safety problems to the CPSC, which may order a recall or import ban. The CPSA provides the general authority of the CPSC over inspections, recalls and import bans for consumer products generally, with the exceptions noted above, unless other statutes provide other agencies with authority over specific products. Although some of the other statutes enforced by the CPSC contain provisions specifically addressing notice/recall, import bans, and other remedies similar to those contained in the CPSA, not all do.", "The CPSC is authorized to inspect domestic facilities where a consumer product is manufactured and the conveyances by which it is transported and which may be relevant to the safety of such product. It is unlawful for a person to fail or refuse to permit inspection as required under the CPSA. For purposes of the CPSA, including inspection and testing, the CPSC may purchase any consumer product and it may require any manufacturer, distributor, or retailer of a consumer product to sell the product to the CPSC at cost. The CPSC is authorized to establish and maintain a permanent product surveillance program, in cooperation with other appropriate Federal agencies, for the purpose of carrying out the CPSC's responsibilities under the CPSA and the other Acts it administers and preventing the entry of unsafe consumer products into the United States. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is authorized to obtain and deliver samples of consumer products being offered for importation to the CPSC, upon its request, for the purpose of inspecting such samples for compliance with the CPSA. Similarly, under FHSA \u00a7 14 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1273), the CBP is authorized to obtain and deliver samples of hazardous substances being imported or offered for importation to the CPSC, upon its request, for the purpose of inspecting such samples for compliance with the FHSA.", "Under CPSA \u00a719, it has been unlawful, among other things, to manufacture, sell, distribute in commerce, or import into the United States any consumer product which does not comply with an applicable consumer product safety standard or which has been declared a banned hazardous product by a rule under the CPSA. Other consumer-product-related statutes contain similar provisions concerning prohibited or unlawful acts. The CPSIA has expanded the scope of prohibited acts.", "Under CPSA \u00a715, every manufacturer (defined to include importers), distributor, or retailer of a consumer product distributed in commerce who obtains information reasonably supporting the conclusion that such product (1) fails to comply with an applicable consumer product safety rule or with a voluntary consumer product safety standard; (2) contains a defect which could create a substantial product hazard; or (3) creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death, shall immediately inform the CPSC, unless such manufacturer, distributor, or retailer has actual knowledge that the CPSC has been adequately informed of such defect, failure to comply, or risk. If the CPSC determines after a hearing that a product presents a substantial product hazard and that notification is required in order to adequately protect the public from such substantial product hazard, the CPSC may order the manufacturer or any distributor or retailer of the product to take any one or more of the following actions: (1) to give public notice of the defect or failure to comply; (2) to mail notice to each person who is a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer of such product; or (3) to mail notice to every person to whom the person required to give notice knows such product was delivered or sold. The CPSIA expanded the scope of these provisions to cover noncompliance with rules under all acts under CPSC jurisdiction and to provide additional means of providing public notice.", "Prior to the CPSIA, if the CPSC determined after a hearing that a product presented a substantial product hazard and that action under that provision was in the public interest, it could order the manufacturer or any distributor or retailer of such product to take whichever of the following actions it elected to take: (1) to bring the product into compliance with the applicable product safety rule or repair the defect; (2) to replace the product with an equivalent product that does comply or is not defective; or (3) to refund the purchase price. The CPSIA removed the ability of the manufacturer, distributor or retailer to choose the remedial action to be taken and provides for the CPSC to determine which action should be taken.", "In addition to its authority with regard to a substantial product hazard, under CPSA \u00a712, the CPSC may bring an action in federal district court to have a product declared an imminent hazard, defined as a consumer product which presents imminent and unreasonable risks of death, serious illness, or severe personal injury, and to seize the product. If the court determines that a product constitutes an imminent hazard, it may grant any relief necessary to protect the public, including an order requiring public notification, recall, and remedies including repair, replacement, or refund of such product.", "Under the FHSA \u00a715, the CPSC may order a manufacturer, distributor, or dealer to take remedial action with respect to a banned hazardous substance similar to remedies under the CPSA, including (1) giving public notice that an article or substance is a banned hazardous substance; (2) mailing notice to each person who is a manufacturer, distributor, or dealer of such article or substance; and (3) mailing such notice to every person to whom the person giving the notice knows such article or substance was delivered or sold. The CPSC may also order the repair of such article or substance, replacement with an equivalent compliant article or substance, or refund. Similar notification and remedial actions may be ordered with respect to any toy or other article intended for use by children that is not a banned hazardous substance but that contains a defect which creates a substantial risk of injury to children.", "The CPSC does not pay for the costs of a notice of product hazard or defect or any ordered repair, replacement, or refund; costs are born by the manufacturer, distributor, or retailer. An order issued under CPSA \u00a715 with respect to a product may require any person who is a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer of the product to reimburse any other person who is a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer of such product for such other person's expenses in connection with carrying out the order, if the CPSC determines such reimbursement to be in the public interest. Also, no charge shall be made to any person (other than a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer) who avails himself of any remedy provided under an order concerning repair, replacement, or refund, and the person subject to the order shall reimburse each person (other than a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer) who is entitled to such a remedy for any reasonable and foreseeable expenses incurred by such person in availing himself of such remedy. FHSA \u00a714(d) contains reimbursement provisions similar to CPSA \u00a715. Any person who is a manufacturer, distributor, or dealer of a noncompliant toy, article, or substance may be ordered to reimburse any other person who is a manufacturer, distributor, or dealer of such toy, article, or substance for such other person's expenses in connection with carrying out a remedial or notification order, if the CPSC determines such reimbursement to be in the public interest. Also, no charge shall be made to any person (other than a manufacturer, distributor, or dealer) who avails himself of any remedy provided under a remedial order and the person subject to the order shall reimburse each person (other than a manufacturer, distributor, or dealer) who is entitled to a remedy for any reasonable and foreseeable expenses incurred in seeking such remedy.", "CPSC has the authority to establish import standards and policy with regard to statutes and products under its jurisdiction. Under the CPSA, importers are made subject to the same responsibilities as domestic manufacturers in protecting American consumers from unreasonably hazardous products. This is explicitly stated in the definition of \"manufacturer\" as any person who manufactures or imports a consumer product. Like the CPSA, the FHSA and the FFA assign responsibilities to importers comparable to those of domestic manufacturers and distributors. Various statutory provisions authorize the CPSC to ban noncompliant imports. If the CPSC determines after a hearing that a product presents a substantial product hazard and that action under that provision is in the public interest, it may issue an order prohibiting the importation into the United States of that product. An imported consumer product may be refused admission to the United States if it does not comply with an applicable consumer product safety rule; does not comply with labeling and certification requirements relating to applicable product safety standards; is an imminently hazardous product; or has a product defect which constitutes a substantial product hazard. The CPSC may then inform the CBP that an imported consumer product fails to comply with an applicable consumer product safety rule and/or has a product defect which constitutes a substantial product hazard and may request the CBP to refuse admission to any such consumer product. As discussed in this report, the CPSIA has expanded grounds for refusing admission to a product. Under FHSA \u00a7 14, a misbranded hazardous substance or banned hazardous substance being imported or offered for import shall be refused importation. Section 9 of the Flammable Fabrics Act (FFA) provides that imported products subject to flammability standards under the FFA shall not be released from customs custody except in accordance with \u00a7 499 of the Tariff Act of 1930 providing for release only after inspection by CBP for compliance with U.S. laws. The CBP also has authority for the redelivery or recall of products already released under bond but later found not to comply with flammability standards and for obtaining liquidated damages for breach of a condition of the bond arising out of a failure either to correct the product to comply or to redeliver it.", "Such noncompliant or defective products must be destroyed or exported from the United States unless they can be modified by the owner or consignee in a manner that will enable them to be granted admission into the United States. The CPSC and the CBP have the authority to give the owner or consignee the opportunity to make such modifications and to monitor such modifications. Prior to the CPSIA, such products could also be ordered destroyed at the discretion of the CPSC. The CPSIA made destruction mandatory, unless the CBP permits export in lieu of destruction and the product is exported within 90 days of such permission. Before the CPSIA, at its discretion, the CPSC could condition importation of a consumer product on the manufacturer's/importer's compliance with the inspection and recordkeeping requirements of the CPSA. The CPSIA makes compliance with such requirements mandatory, meaning that an imported product must be refused entry into the United States if the importer does not comply with requirements related to its product. The CPSC may seek an injunction or seizure of a consumer product that does not comply with a consumer product safety rule or that is being manufactured, sold, distributed, or imported in violation of a CPSC order for remedial action or prohibiting importation.", "With regard to imported products that are admitted and subsequently become the subject of a recall, if the CPSC is not able to exercise jurisdiction over a foreign manufacturer that has no U.S. subsidiary/presence, the CPSC may order the importer to undertake a recall and to be responsible for the expense of a mandatory recall, since \"manufacturer\" is defined to include importers under the CPSA. The importer cannot obtain reimbursement under the CPSA, but might be able to obtain reimbursement from the foreign manufacturer as a contractual matter. Under CPSA \u00a717(f), the owner or consignee of an imported consumer product denied entry into the United States must pay for all expenses in connection with its storage or destruction. In default of such payment, these expenses shall constitute a lien against any future importations made by such owner or consignee. Under FHSA \u00a714(c), the owner or consignee must pay for all expenses (including travel, per diem, or subsistence, and salaries of officers or employees of the United States) in connection with the destruction of a hazardous substance denied importation into the United States; the supervision of the relabeling or other action authorized to bring a hazardous substance denied importation into compliance with the FHSA so that it may be granted importation; and the storage for any hazardous substance denied importation. In default of such payment, the FHSA, like the CPSA, provides that such expenses shall constitute a lien against any future importations made by such owner or consignee.", "The Office of Compliance and Field Operations within the CPSC conducts compliance and administrative enforcement activities under all administered acts, provides advice and guidance on complying with all administered acts, and reviews proposed standards and rules with respect to their enforceability. Among other things, it reviews consumer complaints, conducts inspections and in-depth investigations, and analyzes available data to identify those consumer products containing defects that pose a substantial risk of injury or do not comply with existing safety requirements. The Office negotiates and monitors corrective action plans for products that are defective or fail to comply with specific regulations.", "The Office of International Programs and Intergovernmental Affairs within the CPSC was established to enable a more coordinated and comprehensive approach to international cooperation with regard to harmonization of safety standards internationally and the ensuring of compliance with U.S. safety standards for products imported into the United States. Memoranda of understanding have been concluded with CPSC counterparts in various countries or regional groups, including the People's Republic of China, the European Union, and Canada.", "The CPSC held a public meeting on September 4, 2008, to explain their plans to implement the CPSIA and will continue to hold a series of such meetings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Legislation: P.L. 110-314", "paragraphs": ["There have been a number of proposals in the 110 th Congress to address a range of consumer product safety issues.

Language from some of the free-standing bills addressing specific issues was incorporated into the CPSIA.", "The following sections will summarize the provisions of P.L. 110-314 . The final text was the result of a lengthy conference negotiation. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 4040 [hereinafter Senate Text] and the House-passed version of H.R. 4040 [hereinafter House Text] contained many similar provisions strengthening the authority and resources of the CPSC and also establishing standards concerning lead content in children's toys. However, the Senate Text contained additional reform provisions, such as whistleblower protection and several provisions concerning consumer product safety standards for specific items such as all-terrain vehicles and garage door openers. Conversely, most of the provisions of the House Text had parallel provisions in the Senate Text; the major exception was the provision adding a prohibition on industry-sponsored travel by members or employees of the CPSC, a response to the much-criticized practice by the CPSC of accepting travel and lodging expenses from industry sponsors for trips related to CPSC business, that was widely reported after the S. 2045 markup. On July 29, 2008, H.Rept. 110-787 , the Conference Report for H.R. 4040 , the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, was released after several months of negotiations in the conference committee to reconcile differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill.

If 100ppm is not technically feasible, the CPSC must set the lowest level that is technologically feasible. After promulgation of either the 100ppm level or the lowest level technologically feasible, the CPSC is required to periodically review and lower the limit at least every five years. There are exceptions for certain materials or products and inaccessible component parts. If the CPSC determines that it is not technologically feasible for certain electronic devices to comply with the lead standard, it must also issue requirements to minimize exposure or accessibility to lead in those devices. The permissible lead level in paint is reduced to 0.009 percent (90 ppm) from 0.06 percent (600ppm), subject to subsequent periodic review and reduction to the lowest lead level technologically feasible.

The CPSC must issue accreditation requirements for such laboratories and maintain a list of accredited laboratories; deadlines for the publication of such requirements differ according to the type of product being tested by the laboratory. Specific deadlines for publication of accreditation requirements after CPSIA enactment are established for the testing of lead paint (30 days of enactment), cribs and pacifiers (60 days of enactment), small parts (90 days of enactment), children's metal jewelry (120 days of enactment), and baby bouncers/walkers/jumpers (210 days of enactment).

This section provides for certain safeguards for the public disclosure of information on products that are identified as specific products of named manufacturers. Proprietary/trade secret information may not be disclosed, and information protected from disclosure by the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) may not be disclosed. The manufacturer must be notified and given the opportunity to review information to be disclosed with regard to confidentiality and accuracy within a minimum period of time prior to disclosure, unless the CPSC finds that public health and safety require a lesser period of notice and publishes this finding. If the CPSC disagrees with the manufacturer and decides to disclose allegedly confidential or inaccurate information over the objections of the manufacturer, the manufacturer may sue in federal district court to enjoin disclosure. Certain types of information disclosure are exempt from these safeguards, including information regarding an imminently hazardous product, a violation of the CPSA, a rulemaking proceeding, an adjudicatory proceeding, or other proceeding under the CPSA. Consumer advocates and retailer critics of this provision prior to amendments made by the CPSIA asserted that these safeguards unnecessarily hindered the disclosure of safety and recall information, while industry advocates sought stronger protections with regard to substantiation and disclosure of information on product categories with problems that are not common to all manufacturers.", "Section 211 of the CPSIA reduces prior disclosure protections in several ways:", "A manufacturer/private labeler must respond within 15 days after the CPSC notifies it of the opportunity to mark as confidential information that could permit the public to identify it as the manufacturer/labeler of a product. Although the CPSA previously did not specify a time within which the manufacturer/labeler must respond, CPSC regulations concerning disclosures under the Freedom of Information Act (16 C.F.R. \u00a71015.18) require a response in five working days to a notice concerning information previously submitted to the CPSC by the manufacturer/labeler. These regulations also require that a response must accompany information submitted after a CPSC notice of the opportunity to request confidentiality (the submission may indicate a final confidentiality response within 10 working days of the new submission). The amendment reduces from 30 to 15 days before disclosure the time within which the CPSC must notify a manufacturer/labeler of an intended disclosure and provide the opportunity to comment on accuracy, and from 10 to five days the time within which the CPSC must notify a manufacturer/labeler that it will still disclose information claimed to be inaccurate based on a CPSC determination that the disclosure is accurate and fair. The CPSC is no longer required to publish in the Federal Register a finding that public health and safety require a lesser period of notice to the manufacturer, as it was before the CPSIA; it may publish this in any manner. Exemption of certain information from the disclosure protections is expanded to include violations of any rule or law enforced by the CPSC, not just the CPSA, and information for which the CPSC publishes a finding that public health and safety requires disclosure with a lesser period of notice and comment on accuracy than normally required. The CPSC is authorized to file a request for expedited consideration in a civil action in the federal district court for the District of Columbia to enjoin the disclosure of allegedly inaccurate information. However, such expedited consideration is not available in an action to enjoin disclosure on the grounds that it is protected or confidential under other laws.
