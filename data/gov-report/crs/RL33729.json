As a result, the 109th Congress revised federal emergency management policies vested in the President; reorganized the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); and enhanced and clarified the mission, functions, and authorities of the agency, as well as those of its parent, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).", "Six statutes enacted by the 109th Congress are notable in that they contain changes that apply to future federal emergency management actions.

The Post-Katrina Act, however, contains many changes that will have long-term consequences for FEMA and other federal entities. That statute reorganizes FEMA, expands its statutory authority, and imposes new conditions and requirements on the operations of the agency.", "The Administration will implement these new authorities through the FY2008 appropriations legislation. The oversight plans of committees with jurisdiction indicate that Members of the 110th Congress will evaluate the steps taken by the leadership of FEMA to carry out the expanded legislative mandate. In addition, Members will continue to debate legislation pertaining to the recovery of Gulf Coast states.

In addition to these impacts, the hurricanes served as catalysts for significant changes in federal policy and the organization of responsible federal entities, notably within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).", "Most of those changes were included in Title VI of the DHS appropriations legislation for FY2007. Among other provisions, Title VI, officially titled the \"Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006\" (hereafter referred to as the Post-Katrina Act), established new leadership positions and position requirements within the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), brought new missions into FEMA and restored some that had previously been removed, and enhanced the agency's authority by directing the FEMA Administrator to undertake a broad range of activities before and after disasters occur. The Post-Katrina Act contains provisions that set out new law, amend the Homeland Security Act (HSA), and modify the Robert T.

In carrying out its mission, FEMA has (1) funded and coordinated emergency preparedness activities, (2) provided and coordinated immediate federal response to save lives and property, (3) funded the reconstruction of damaged homes and infrastructure to help stricken families and communities recover, and (4) supported hazard mitigation activities to ensure that future disasters do not recur, or are less destructive in the future. These four elements of preparedness, response, recovery, and hazard mitigation constitute what has been generally referred to as the comprehensive emergency management (CEM) system.", "As a small independent agency from 1979 through 2000, FEMA exercised responsibility for federal implementation of the CEM concept. For part of that time, from 1993 through 2000, agency officials also used those concepts to organize the agency. Beginning in the spring of 2001 (before the September terrorist attacks), the Bush Administration reorganized FEMA reportedly to take \"the agency in a new direction by refocusing its efforts on civil defense and counterterrorism.\" After the terrorist attacks, through enactment of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (HSA), the 107 th Congress and the Bush Administration continued the reorganization of the agency by divesting it of certain CEM responsibilities. Of particular relevance to this examination, the HSA transferred emergency preparedness functions related to terrorism from FEMA to the Border and Transportation Security (BTS) Directorate.", "The reassignment of certain CEM responsibilities, and concomitant organizational changes, continued in 2005, both before and after Hurricane Katrina. Pursuant to the HSA, which authorizes the Secretary to reorganize most parts of the department, Secretary Chertoff initiated what he called the Second Stage Review, or 2SR initiative, in the winter of 2005. After roughly six months, Secretary Chertoff recommended, and Congress approved, the division of responsibility for CEM functions.", "Since October 1, 2005, CEM functions have been divided between two components of the department\u2014FEMA and the new Preparedness Directorate (PD). The FEMA Director, who also held the title of Under Secretary for Federal Emergency Management, has reported directly to the Secretary and has overseen three divisions (Response, Mitigation, and Recovery), ten regional offices, and numerous other components. Emergency preparedness functions have been vested in PD, which has been headed by an under secretary who has reported to the Secretary. Major components in this directorate have included the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security for Infrastructure Protection; the Chief Medical Officer of DHS; the Office of Grants and Training; the U.S. Fire Administration; the Office of the National Capital Region Coordination; the Center for Faith-Based and Community Initiatives; and the Office of Cyber and Telecommunications, which includes the National Communications System and the National Cybersecurity Division. Of note, however, is the exclusion of one preparedness function from the PD portfolio. FEMA has continued to exercise a limited role in coordinating and guiding the efforts of federal agencies to prepare, maintain, and exercise contingency plans to ensure that essential government functions continue after catastrophes.", "In examining the lessons learned from Hurricane Katrina, the 109 th Congress considered this dynamic history of functional and organizational changes. It appears that Congress concluded that while the HSA vested responsibilities of leading and supporting a national, risk-based CEM program in FEMA, the assignment of authorities and the organization of the agency indicated otherwise. Some contended that, as a result of these mission and organizational shifts, FEMA's capabilities deteriorated as functions, resources, and responsibilities moved to other DHS units. Others argued that an emphasis on terrorist-caused incidents within DHS dominated planning and allocation decisions and contributed to FEMA's diminished capabilities for all hazards.
