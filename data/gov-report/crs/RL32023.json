The most recent time it was raised to high was on July 7, 2005, due to terrorist bombings of the London mass transit systems. DHS raised the threat level for mass transit systems only.

The HSAS is designed to measure and evaluate terrorist threats and communicate these threats to federal, state, and local governments, the public, and the private sector in a timely manner. Although HSAS is a nationwide system, it can also be used at a smaller scale to warn of threats against a state, city, critical infrastructure, or industry.

The National Alert Office would have been established within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the National Alert System would have provided a public alert on national, regional, and local emergencies requiring a public response. H.R. 5001 would have required the DHS Undersecretary for Information and Analysis to implement changes to HSAS.

The only other time any specifics were given on possible terrorist attack targets was on February 7, 2003, when former DHS Secretary Ridge cited intelligence reports suggesting Al Qaeda attacks on apartment buildings, hotels, and other soft skin targets.

He said that the system needs to be further refined.", "Questions about the credibility of the threat, say other observers, might cause the public to wonder how to act or whether to take any special action at all. Some observers maintain that, without specific terrorist threat information, there is no basis for formulating a clear, easily understood public announcement of what appropriate protective measures to take. Others assert that the continued lack of specific information arguably can lead to complacency.", "DHS officials cite the lack of specificity in intelligence as the reason for a lack of detailed information when the threat level is changed. Former Secretary Ridge has been quoted saying that the intelligence gathered so far has been generic; but he maintained that DHS, and the federal intelligence community that provides information about terrorist threats will improve.", "Option 1: Status Quo . Congress may view the evolution of the process, and decisions relating to it are best left to the Department. The lack of specificity may be due to the need to protect intelligence sources or a desire by DHS to issue warnings when threat information is generic, but nonetheless credible. Maintaining the status quo places the burden of responding to complaints about the vagueness of HSAS warnings and the critiques of DHS's perceived inability to give adequate terrorist attack warnings on the Department.", "Option 2: Provide General Warnings . Due to the reported misunderstanding of HSAS threat levels, and the system's lack of recommended protective measures for state and local agencies, the public, and private-sector entities, Congress could consider directing DHS to issue general warnings concerning the threat of terrorist attacks without using the HSAS to notify state and local governments, the public, and the private sector. General warnings via public statements, in coordination with HSAS warnings to the federal government, would ensure that notices of terrorist threats are issued to state and local governments, the public, and the private sector. DHS chose to provide general warnings on September 4, 2003, and November 21, 2003. On September 4, 2003, DHS cited recent federal interagency reviews of information that raised concerns about possible Al Qaeda plans to attack the U.S. and U.S. interests overseas. This general warning listed aviation, critical infrastructure, WMD, and soft target threats, however, no specifics were given on possible location or type of attacks. Another general warning was issued on November 21, 2003, when DHS cited a high volume of reports concerning the possible threats against U.S. interests during the Muslim holiday of Ramadan. These reports suggested Al Qaeda remained interested in using commercial aircraft as weapons against critical infrastructure; however, no location of possible attacks was specified. This approach would address the concerns of some who have asserted that the HSAS causes misunderstanding at the state and local level, but it would not address the issue raised by those who say DHS does not give enough specificity in its terrorist attack warnings.", "Option 3: Increase Specificity of Warnings . Were Congress to decide that the terrorist warnings issued by DHS are too vague and cause complacency in state and local agencies, the public, and the private sector, it might instruct DHS to use the HSAS to provide specific warnings to targeted federal facilities, regions, states, localities, and private sector industries to the extent that is possible. DHS has said that its goal is to have the capability to issue high alerts to designated cities, geographical regions, industry, or critical infrastructure. This approach arguably would address the concerns about the perceived vagueness of HSAS warnings.

There is no Emergency Alert System (EAS) type communication activated to alert the public to a change in threat condition, so the public is not informed of the change until they monitor a public news source.", "Private sector alerts are through systems like CEO COM LINK and conference calls.

This arguably results in a de facto prioritization of alerted private sector entities, which could result in a targeted private sector entity being attacked without a timely and effective alert.", "Option 1: Status Quo . Congress may decide to allow DHS to deal with issues relating to HSAS advisories at this stage of HSAS development. This approach would encourage the continued utilization of the DHS terrorist threat communication systems. Since the HSAS is designed for federal government use, there may be no need for DHS to establish any other communication systems that disseminate changes in the HSAS terrorist threat levels. This would, however, not address the issues some have raised about the dissemination of HSAS advisories. Some would argue that before DHS establishes a specific system that communicates a change in HSAS terrorist threat levels, DHS needs to establish protective measures for states, localities, the public, and the private sector. This argument is based on the belief that there is little value in knowing of a change in the HSAS terrorist threat level in the absence of recommended protective measures.", "Option 2: Revise the HSAS Notification Process . Congress could encourage, or enact legislation instructing DHS to revise the HSAS notification process to ensure that state and local law enforcement, and emergency management agencies are informed of changes of the terrorist threat level in a more effective and timely manner.

This approach, however, would not address the issue of the public, and private sectors receiving timely notification of changes in the HSAS threat level.", "A possible communications system DHS could use for disseminating threat level changes of the HSAS is the Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN).

Mature warning systems have established alerting protocols and routines that, if consolidated, could become too broad, which may result in less effective warnings.", "Option 1: Status Quo . Without congressional intervention, federal agencies responsible for issuing warnings will likely continue to narrowly focus on traditional hazards. This approach allows mature warning systems to continue communicating alerts and protective measures to an identified audience. Also, this approach would not incur an increased need for federal funding that would be required to update, test, and ensure compatibility of the systems. On the other hand, this approach would not address issues such as overlap of hazards (terrorist threat warnings of HSAS, and any presidential declared emergency warning issued by EAS), and the potential need to reach a wide audience through the use of multiple warning systems.", "Option 2: Coordination and Update of Warning Systems . If Congress decided to address the issue of coordinating warning systems, it could require all federal agencies with hazard warning responsibilities, to establish, and develop a means for coordinating and updating existing warning systems. This approach could allow any warning of man-made or natural hazards to be issued on the full range of federal warning systems. This could ensure that a larger number of the state and local governments, the public, and private sector entities would receive the specific warning in an effective and timely manner. It would require a communication protocol to be developed that allowed one federal warning system to \"talk\" to a different system.", "Updating of warning systems would not only include the ability of one system to \"talk\" to another, but could also include the ability of such systems as EAS to be transmitted on off-the-shelf telecommunication devices such as cellular phones. Given the widespread use of wireless communications, some observers have argued for warnings to be issued on wireless devices. In the 108 th Congress, S. 564 proposes such an approach that would facilitate the deployment of wireless networks in order to extend the range and reach of EAS. It would also ensure emergency personnel priority access to communications facilities in times of emergency.", "Option 3: Consolidation of Warning Systems . If Congress decided that there needs to be an all-hazard warning system, it could enact legislation requiring the federal agencies that have warning responsibilities to develop and implement such a system to warn states, localities, the public, and the private sector.

In the 108 th Congress, two bills, S. 118 , and H.R. 2537 , propose such an approach to all-hazard warnings. The bills propose the establishment of a single all-hazard warning system that would ensure that states, localities, the public, and the private sector would be alerted to specific risks from man-made, and natural hazards.

It has been observed that increased threat levels and the need for heightened security have hurt the tourism industry of such metropolitan areas as Washington, DC, New York, and Chicago. Washington's Mayor Anthony Williams urged residents to be alert for suspicious activities. He also wanted the city to remain friendly, open, and safe to minimize the affects of the terrorist threat level on tourism. D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton agreed with the need to keep Washington open to tourism. She said that the city's tourism industry had been hurt by changes in threat condition, and that she feared some officials would overreact and shut down public buildings. An example of the impact on tourism is the decision by some schools to cancel trips to Washington because of the threat of terrorist attack.", "Some municipal officials have had to make a costly decision between homeland security and tourism. Philadelphia's mayor, John F. Street, for instance, chose not to close down a street around Independence Hall after he received a call from DHS Secretary Ridge, who advised its closing. Mayor Street cited traffic and tourism concerns as the reason he chose not to respond to the recommendation. Another indirect cost may be how a change in the HSAS threat condition affects the stock markets.", "Option 1: Status Quo . Congress may decide that the Office of Grant Programs homeland security assistance adequately meets the needs of states and localities' homeland security costs due to a heightened HSAS threat. It may be an appropriate approach for ensuring the splitting of homeland security costs among the several tiers of government. This policy approach would not however, address such issues as the needs of some state and local first responder agencies, of hiring additional personnel, the loss of revenue generated by tourism due to an increased terrorist threat level, or the cost the economy incurs when the terrorist threat level is raised.", "Option 2: Funding Through Established the Office of Grant Programs . Should Congress decide that more funding needs to be provided to cover costs incurred by states and localities due to an increased terrorist threat level, it could consider establishing grant programs that specifically fund such terrorist prevention, preparedness, and mitigation activities as overtime pay for first responders and the purchase of equipment and personnel for the protection of critical infrastructure. In the 108 th Congress, S. 1245 proposed such an approach by recommending that a consolidated homeland security grant program provide grant allocations for overtime expenses related to training, activities (as determined by the DHS Secretary) relating to an increase in the HSAS threat level, and emergency preparedness responses to a WMD incident.", "Option 3: Funding Specifically for Heightened Threat Levels . Should Congress decide to provide funding for costs incurred during heightened threat level periods, it could appropriate funds, in addition to the Office of Grant Programs homeland security assistance, specifically to states, localities, and private sector entities to compensate for costs associated with a change in the HSAS threat level.
