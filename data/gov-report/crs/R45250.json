This is determined by the states. Most federal highway money, however, may be used only for a designated network of highways. While Interstate Highways and other high-volume roads in rural areas are eligible for these funds, most smaller rural roads are not. It is these roads, often under the control of county or township governments, that are most likely to have poor pavement and deficient bridges.", "Rural roads received about 37% of federal highway funds during FY2009-FY2015, although they accounted for about 30% of annual vehicle miles traveled. As a result, federal-aid-eligible rural roads are in comparatively good condition: 49% of rural roads were determined to offer good ride quality in 2016, compared with 27% of urban roads. Although 1 in 10 rural bridges is structurally deficient, the number of deficient rural bridges has declined by 41% since 2000.

However, an April 2018 statement by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) contended \"underinvestment in rural transportation systems has allowed a slow and steady decline in the transportation routes that connect rural American communities.\" DOT said that it intends to favor rural areas in awarding discretionary grants for highway projects.", "If it seeks to focus on the condition of rural roads and bridges, Congress could expand the network of federal-aid highways to include more local roads; could create new programs that would specifically target transportation in rural areas; and/or could fund an expansion of the Interstate System. Without an increase in overall funding levels, however, such measures might cause states to spread their federal highway funds across wider networks of highways, making it more difficult for them to marshal the funds needed to undertake large and costly projects. Alternatively, given the population loss in some rural areas, Congress might provide incentives for states and counties to close or pulverize underused roads back to gravel and close underused and structurally deficient rural bridges, encouraging them to devote more of their resources to more heavily used roads."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Despite steady urbanization, some 71% of U.S. road mileage is in rural areas.

Under this definition, many urban fringe counties and rural areas within urban counties are treated as rural. Some 97% of the land area of the United States, home to about 60 million people or 19% of the U.S. population, is rural under the Census Bureau definition. People who live in areas that are defined as rural in this way are more likely to own single-family homes, to reside in their state of birth, to be older, and to have somewhat lower household incomes than those living in urban areas. The Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service (ERS) uses a definition established by the Office of Management and Budget, under which rural counties do not have urbanized areas of 50,000 or more people and are not tied to urbanized areas by labor commuting patterns. This definition, which encompasses 72% of U.S. land area and 46 million residents, treats many urban fringe areas as urbanized, in contrast to the Census Bureau's definition. ERS finds the median household income in rural areas to be about 25% lower than in urban areas, although it says this gap is mitigated by differences in the cost of living. ERS also finds that median household farm income exceeded median U.S. household income by 29%, suggesting that farm households fare better economically than other rural households. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) uses definitions of urban and rural areas similar to those of the Census Bureau, but sets a higher population threshold to qualify as an urban area (over 5,000 residents, as opposed to 2,500). FHWA's definition also considers population density. These differences mean that a larger area is considered rural by FHWA than by the Census Bureau.

Automobile commuting is more common for workers living outside of metropolitan areas (91%) compared with commuters living in a large central city (78%). Generally, vehicle availability rates are high in rural areas: only 2.3% of workers who live outside of a principal city lack access to a vehicle. Despite this, a high proportion of low-income rural households are characterized by \"carlessness.\" According to 2017 National Household Travel Survey data, nearly 20% of rural households with incomes below $15,000 lack access to a vehicle.", "Agriculture and mining continue to be major rural industries but because of productivity increases and more rapid growth of other sectors, agriculture (2%) and mining (3%) together provide less than 5% of wage and salary jobs in rural counties. The leading sources of rural employment are education and health (25%); trade, transportation, and utilities (20%); manufacturing (15%); and leisure and hospitality (11%). Increased oil and gas drilling has been an important source of rural job growth in recent years. Most other industries added jobs in rural areas at rates below nationwide trends between 2001 and 2015. Rural manufacturers, who are concentrated in the eastern states, shed 700,000 jobs over that period.

Much of the postrecession population loss in rural parts of the eastern states is related to the loss of manufacturing jobs. The statistics also are affected by the reclassification of counties from rural to urban due to population growth on the fringes of metropolitan areas; this results in the fastest-growing counties no longer being counted as rural, leaving counties with slower average population growth rates in the rural category.

For example, some states have gradually expanded two-lane state highways into limited-access four-lane roads for safety purposes but also in the hope that greater rural road capacity would lead to more economic development. If there are no other substantive reasons for employers to locate in a particular community, however, construction could produce little-used infrastructure which might provide few of the hoped-for benefits. There would be opportunity costs for not spending the highway funds elsewhere."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Autonomous Vehicle Potential in Rural Areas", "paragraphs": ["Fully autonomous vehicles that can navigate the entire public access road network could provide major benefits to rural areas. The vehicles have the potential to provide the kind of mobility to rural areas that public transportation does to urban areas. Getting elderly or carless rural residents to appointments, lowering accident rates, and increasing the efficiency of freight movements are examples of the kinds of benefits that autonomous vehicles could bring to rural areas. ", "Currently there are no fully autonomous vehicles available for public use. The availability of vehicles that can drive autonomously at all times on all rural roads is likely far into the future. However, autonomous vehicles that can safely and effectively operate within a limited domain of roads may come into use considerably sooner. In rural areas, Interstate System roads are likely to be the first roads on which autonomous vehicles operate because of their design uniformity. Unpaved rural roads may offer greater challenges to autonomous vehicles, due to the lack of road markings and uniform design features. The need for predictability of road design will make road design standards an important factor in the adoption of autonomous vehicles. ", "Appendix A.
