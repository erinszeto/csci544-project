In September 1994, after a U.S. military intervention had been launched, the military regime agreed to Aristide's return, the immediate, unopposed entry of U.S. troops, and the resignation of its leadership. President Aristide returned to Haiti in October 1994 under the protection of some 20,000 U.S. troops, and disbanded the Haitian army. U.S. aid helped train a civilian police force. Subsequently, critics charged Aristide with politicizing that force and engaging in corrupt practices.", "Elections held under Aristide and his successor, Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val (1996-2000), including the one in which Aristide was reelected in 2000, were marred by alleged irregularities, low voter turnout, and opposition boycotts. Efforts to negotiate a resolution to the electoral dispute frustrated the international community for years. Tension and violence continued throughout Aristide's second term, culminating in his departure from office in February 2004, after the opposition repeatedly refused to negotiate a political solution and armed groups took control of half the country.", "An interim government, backed by the Bush Administration, was established with G\u00e9rard LaTortue as Prime Minister.

After several postponements, presidential elections were held on February 7, 2006, and runoff legislative elections were held on April 21. The electoral council declared Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val winner after a controversial calculation process. He was inaugurated to a five-year presidential term on May 14, 2006. President Pr\u00e9val has sought to restore stability, build democratic institutions, and establish conditions for private investment in order to create jobs. He enjoys broad support from the international donor community, the Bush Administration, and Congress.

The U.S. government is providing close to $4 million to support the Senate elections in Haiti. The elections, originally scheduled for the late fall, were postponed after members of the country's electoral commission accused the commission's leadership of embezzling funds. President Pr\u00e9val named a new commission in December 2007, but expressed serious concerns about his country's ability to afford the multiple elections that the current Haitian constitution requires. His December statements followed an October 2007 speech in which he called for constitutional reform.

That and other seizures occurred as a result of a series of joint interdiction operations carried out in the spring and summer of 2007 by DEA, Dominican, and Haitian officials. There is increasing concern among some Members of Congress that Haiti and the Dominican Republic are becoming major transhipment points for drugs coming from South America.

The most controversial of 11 presidential candidates, Aristide won a landslide victory with 67.5% of the vote. His inauguration took place in February 1991, on the fifth anniversary of Jean-Claude Duvalier's flight into exile.", "President Aristide was faced with some of the most serious and persistent social, economic, and political problems in the Western Hemisphere. After eight months in office, Aristide had received mixed reviews. He was credited with curbing crime in the capital, reducing the number of employees in bloated state enterprises, and taking actions to bring the military under civilian control. But some observers questioned his government's commitment to democracy. Opposition leaders and others criticized him for not establishing a cooperative relationship among the democratic elements, failing to consult the legislature in appointments as required by the Constitution, and for manipulating the judicial system in the prosecution of Duvalierists. His record in the area of respect for human rights was also mixed. He was criticized for appearing to condone mob violence, but was also credited with significantly reducing human rights violations while he was in office.", "Some observers believe that during his eight-month tenure, Aristide contributed to political polarization within Haiti by refusing to condemn violent acts of retribution, and holding out the threat of mob violence against those who disagreed with him. On September 30, 1991, days after a speech in which some contend Aristide threatened the bourgeoisie for not having helped his government enough, Aristide was overthrown by the military. Some maintained that the elite business class financially supported the coup leaders.", "Most human rights monitors credit Aristide's first administration with being the first Haitian government to address the need to improve respect for human rights, and the needs of the poor majority. They also asserted that progress made during his term was undone by the military regime that followed. Most sources credit Aristide with creating a much greater sense of security in Haiti during his first term than there had been in years. According to the State Department human rights reports for 1991 and 1992, there were no reports of disappearances during Aristide's eight-month term and dozens in the months following the coup.

Clinton intensified pressure on the Haitian regime and helped advance negotiations to restore democracy to Haiti, others felt it did not apply enough pressure. After the collapse of the Governors Island Accord, which called for the military regime's resignation and Aristide's return to power by October 30, 1993, critics increased pressure on the Clinton Administration to change its policy. The Administration then took a tougher stance toward the military regime, imposing ever-stiffer sanctions, and ultimately ordering a military intervention to remove it.", "On September 18, 1994, when it learned that a U.S. military intervention had been launched, the military regime signed an agreement with the United States providing for Aristide's return.

Haiti, with U.S. assistance, demobilized the old military, established an interim police force of selected ex-military personnel, and began to train a professional, civilian Haitian National Police (HNP) force. According to various human rights reports, the level of violence, flight of refugees, and alleged assassinations dropped markedly from very high levels during the de facto military regime.", "Also in 1995, President Aristide took steps to hold democratic elections, with substantial assistance from the United States and the international community. Most first-round parliamentary and municipal elections were held in June 1995. Although the deadly violence which had marred past Haitian elections did not occur, election observers alleged that there were numerous irregularities. Several re-run or runoff elections were held from July to October. Pro-Aristide candidates won a large share of the seats. Presidential elections were held December 17, 1995. The Haitian constitution prevented Aristide from running for a second consecutive term.

Haiti was then without a prime minister for a year and a half, with four failed attempts to name a new one, and no resolution to the 1997 elections controversy. In January 1999, President Pr\u00e9val declared that most of Parliament's term had expired, although elections had not been held to replace them.

Instead, the elections brought Haiti into another crisis. Both domestic and international observers noted irregularities in the tabulation of election results for some Senate seats. Nonetheless, the electoral council affirmed those results, which favored former President Aristide's Lavalas party.

In 2001, President Aristide announced a \"zero tolerance\" policy toward suspected criminals. According to various human rights reports, this announcement was followed by numerous extrajudicial killings by the Haitian National Police and lynchings by mobs.

The OAS had been mediating on-again off-again talks between the Aristide government and the opposition alliance Democratic Convergence. In OAS-mediated talks in July 2001, the Aristide government and the opposition agreed to hold new elections for local and most parliamentary seats, but could not agree on a schedule.", "Tensions and violence in Haiti increased dramatically after Aristide assumed his second term in office. Supporters of both President Aristide's Lavalas Family party and the opposition coalition Convergence reportedly engaged in a cycle of violent revenge. In January 2002, the OAS Permanent Council passed Resolution 806 establishing an OAS Mission in Haiti and calling for the Haitian government to do all it could to ensure a climate of security and confidence necessary to hold free and fair elections. In July 2002, the OAS released a report stating that a December 2001 attack on the National Palace was not an attempted coup, as the Aristide Administration had claimed, and that \"[T]he political opposition did not participate in the planning or in the execution of the attack.\" It also said that the government and Lavalas party officials gave arms to militants who plundered and burned the homes and offices of opposition members after the palace attack.", "Also in July 2002, the opposition proposed that presidential elections be re-held as well.

A consensus resolution, negotiated by member states and voted for by Haiti, stated that legislative and local elections were to be held in 2003, on a date to be set by a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP). An \"autonomous, independent, credible and neutral CEP\" was to be established by November 4, 2002. Haiti failed to meet that deadline, in part because the Democratic Convergence refused to name a representative for the council until the government dealt with security issues and made all reparations to opposition forces for damage done by government supporters in December 2001. Aristide named a partial CEP in February 2003. In June 2003, the OAS passed Resolution 1959, regretting that neither the government nor the opposition had fully implemented their obligations under the previous two resolutions, and urging the government to create a safe environment for elections and the opposition to help actively form a CEP.

Aristide supported the initiative, but the opposition, which accused Aristide of corruption and mismanagement, rejected it. In January 2004, the CARICOM secured Aristide's agreement to disarm political gangs, appoint a new prime minister, and form an advisory council. Opposition groups refused to negotiate a settlement or participate in elections unless Aristide resigned.

Street battles ensued when police forces tried to regain control, leaving dozens dead. CARICOM continued trying to negotiate a solution to the crisis. Civil opposition groups operating mainly in the capital denied any links to the armed rebellions. After being criticized by some for statements appearing to indicate it might support the elected President's removal, Administration officials said the remarks were not intended to signal support for Aristide's resignation, and that the Bush Administration sought a peaceful solution to the crisis. Colin Powell and other foreign diplomats suggested the possibility of bringing in outside police forces, but only to support the enforcement of a political agreement reached by the Haitian government and the opposition, such as the one proposed by CARICOM.

He later said he was kidnapped, a charge the White House strongly denies. Following succession protocol outlined in the Haitian constitution, Supreme Court Chief Justice Boniface Alexandre was sworn in as President on February 29.

Accordingly, Boniface Alexandre was named interim President on February 29, 2004, although there was no functioning legislature to confirm his appointment, as called for in the constitution. A tripartite commission, based on an element of the CARICOM proposal, helped establish an interim government headed by Prime Minister G\u00e9rard LaTortue. The Commission was composed of one representative each of Aristide's Lavalas Family party, the civil opposition, and the international community.

Then-Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Roger Noriega defended the Administration's decision not to send in troops while Aristide was still in Haiti. He said that although Aristide voiced support for the CARICOM agreement, he continued to foment violence through his armed supporters, and that the Administration decided supporting his continued rule was not a sustainable policy and not worth risking U.S. lives for.", "At the same hearings, several Members of Congress harshly criticized the Administration for its role in Aristide's departure from Haiti, saying that the Bush Administration refused to provide any assistance to stop the escalating violence in Haiti until Aristide resigned. Some voiced concern that the Administration's actions set a dangerous precedent, that the ouster of a democratically elected government by violent thugs would be tolerated if the government was no longer favored by the current U.S. administration. Some Members called for independent investigations into what they referred to as the coup d'\u00e9tat that removed Aristide from office, and the role of the U.S. in his departure.

Others wondered to what extent the opposition had a unified agenda beyond the removal of Aristide from office.

Members of former President Aristide's Fanmi Lavalas party threatened to boycott the elections in light of their alleged political persecution by the interim government. In the end, elections were held in 2006, and Fanmi Lavalas participated.", "Many observers expressed concern over the actions of former members of the Haitian military after Aristide's departure. Many former military personnel demanded reinstatement of the Haitian army, which was disbanded by President Aristide in 1995 following a period of multiple military coups and gross violations of human rights carried out under military rule. The U.S. government and human rights organizations have objected to armed rebels being given any formal role in Haitian security forces.", "The interim government increased concerns in April 2004 when Prime Minister LaTortue called the rebels \"freedom fighters,\" and Haiti's top police official in the northern region met with former paramilitary leader Louis Jodel Chamblain and Guy Philippe to negotiate roles for their fighters in the police force. Chamberlain had been convicted in absentia for killing a Justice Minister and chief financier of former President Aristide; Guy Philippe was accused of leading a coup attempt against President Pr\u00e9val during his first term in office. In June 2004, LaTortue assured U.S. officials that former soldiers would be subject to the same criteria and human rights vetting procedures as other applicants for joining the Haitian National Police.

In October, Haiti's supreme court overruled that decision, even though Simeus is a long-time U.S. resident who reportedly holds a U.S. passport.

Haiti, with U.S. assistance, demobilized the old military, established an interim police force of selected ex-military personnel, and began to train a professional, civilian Haitian National Police force. The level of reported violence, flight of refugees, and alleged assassinations dropped markedly from very high levels during the de facto military regime. Following the return to civilian rule in 1994, Haiti made progress in the protection of human rights, but the gains made were fragile and threatened by political tensions and problems with impunity.", "During President Aristide's second term, increases in political violence renewed concerns over security and police effectiveness.

The Bush Administration expressed \"deep concern\" about the rule of law in Haiti following the acquittal in a rapidly held retrial of Chamblain and former police official Jackson Joanis in August 2004 for their roles in the 1993 murder of businessman and Aristide supporter Antoine Izmery.

Neptune was finally charged in September 2005 with masterminding the murder of political opponents in St. Marc. An independent U.N. expert on human rights visited the town and said there was not a massacre but confrontations between pro- and anti-Aristide groups that led to deaths on both sides. A U.N. human rights spokesman said that a judge's decision to indict Neptune and try him without a jury was unconstitutional. The official sent the case to the U.N.
