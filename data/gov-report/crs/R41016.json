{"id": "R41016", "title": "The Future of NASA: Space Policy Issues Facing Congress", "released_date": "2011-01-27T00:00:00", "summary": ["The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-267) authorized major changes of direction for NASA. Among these, it called for the development of a new, crew-capable, heavy-lift rocket, and it provided for the development of commercial services to transport NASA crews into low Earth orbit. However, under the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (P.L. 111-242 as amended by P.L. 111-322), NASA continues to operate under a requirement to proceed with its previous human spaceflight program. Moreover, in a period of fiscal constraint, it is unclear whether future appropriations will match the growing NASA budgets envisioned by the 2010 act. Thus the 112th Congress is likely to continue to closely examine the future of NASA.", "Before the 2010 act, NASA's priorities were governed by the Vision for Space Exploration. The Vision was announced by President Bush in January 2004 and endorsed by Congress in the 2005 and 2008 NASA authorization acts (P.L. 109-155 and P.L. 110-422). It directed NASA to focus its efforts on returning humans to the Moon by 2020 and some day sending them to Mars and \"worlds beyond.\" The resulting efforts are approaching major decision points, such as the end of the space shuttle program and key milestones for the Constellation spacecraft development program intended to replace the shuttle. A high-level independent review of the future of human space flight, chaired by Norman R. Augustine, issued its final report in October 2009. It presented several options as alternatives to the Vision and concluded that for human exploration to continue \"in any meaningful way,\" NASA would require an additional $3 billion per year above previous plans.", "In February 2010, the Obama Administration proposed cancelling the Constellation program and eliminating the goal of returning humans to the Moon. NASA would instead rely on commercial providers to transport astronauts to Earth orbit, and its ultimate goal beyond Earth orbit would be human exploration of Mars, with missions to other destinations, such as visiting an asteroid in 2025, as intermediate goals. Operation of the International Space Station would be extended to at least 2020, and long-term technology development would receive increased emphasis. The 2010 authorization act incorporated many of these proposals, though it retained elements of Constellation and scaled back the proposed emphasis on commercial providers and technology development.", "As the 112th Congress oversees NASA's implementation of the 2010 act and considers how to address the broad space policy challenges that remain, it faces questions about", "whether NASA's human exploration program is affordable and sufficiently safe, and if so, what destination or destinations it should explore; how to ensure that new spacecraft for human exploration, both government-owned and commercial, are developed effectively, despite budget constraints; how to manage the transition of workforce and facilities as the space shuttle program comes to an end during 2011; how best to manage and utilize the International Space Station; and how NASA's multiple objectives in human spaceflight, science, aeronautics, and education should be prioritized."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction and Legislative Context", "paragraphs": ["The idea of human spaceflight beyond Earth orbit has captivated many Americans for more than half a century. As U.S. space policy has evolved, new opportunities have emerged, and new challenges have arisen. From 2004 to 2010, the priorities of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) were governed by the Vision for Space Exploration. The Vision was announced by President Bush in January 2004 and endorsed by Congress in the 2005 and 2008 NASA authorization acts ( P.L. 109-155 and P.L. 110-422 ). It directed NASA to focus its efforts on returning humans to the Moon by 2020 and some day sending them to Mars and \"worlds beyond.\" The resulting efforts are now approaching major milestones, such as the end of the space shuttle program and design review decisions for the new spacecraft intended to replace the shuttle.", "In May 2009, the Obama Administration announced plans for a high-level independent review of the future of human space flight, chaired by Norman R. Augustine. Major components of the FY2010 NASA budget request were placeholders, to be revised following the results of this review. The Augustine committee released its final report in October 2009. The report identified serious barriers to the implementation of the Vision and proposed several alternatives. Committees in the House and Senate held hearings to consider the proposals. The Administration did not submit a revised FY2010 budget for NASA. In December 2009, Congress appropriated FY2010 funds for NASA at approximately the level in the President's original request. The appropriations conference report ( H.Rept. 111-366 ) stated that the Augustine committee's report", "raises issues requiring thoughtful consideration by the Administration and the Congress.... It is premature for the conferees to advocate or initiate significant changes to the current program absent a bona fide proposal from the Administration and subsequent assessment, consideration and enactment by Congress.... It is the expressed hope of the conferees that the Administration will formulate its formal decision soon, submit its recommendations for congressional review and consideration, and budget the necessary resources.", "In February 2010, as part of its FY2011 budget, the Administration proposed major changes to the Vision, including the elimination of a human return to the Moon as NASA's primary goal, the cancellation of NASA's Constellation spacecraft development program, a new effort to encourage the private sector to develop commercial crew launch services, and increased emphasis at NASA on technology development and science. The 111 th Congress considered these proposals but ultimately did not pass a regular FY2011 appropriations bill for NASA. Under the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2010 ( P.L. 111-242 as amended by P.L. 111-322 ), NASA is operating at FY2010 funding levels through March 4, 2011. Because the continuing resolution does not explicitly remove it, a restriction in the FY2010 appropriations act that requires NASA to continue the Constellation program remains in effect.", "The 111 th Congress did pass a comprehensive NASA reauthorization bill, the NASA Authorization Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-267 ). This act mandates several major changes in direction for NASA. For example, it calls for the development of a new, crew-capable, heavy-lift rocket, and it provides for the development of commercial services to transport NASA crews into low Earth orbit. In the near term, NASA's ability to implement these changes may be constrained by operating under the continuing resolution. The NASA Inspector General has estimated that if the continuing resolution is extended through the end of FY2011, without changes to the requirement to continue Constellation, NASA will likely have to spend $575 million during FY2011 on activities that it would otherwise no longer pursue. In the longer term, fiscal constraints may also create barriers, if they result in future appropriations that do not match the growing NASA budgets envisioned by the 2010 authorization act.", "As Congress considers these broad space policy challenges, the major issues it faces can be summarized as three broad questions:", "What is NASA for? Different analysts and policy makers give different answers to this question: making scientific discoveries, developing technologies with economic benefits, enhancing national security, enhancing international prestige, even fulfilling human destiny in space. How should these competing goals be prioritized? What should NASA do? In order to accomplish its broad goals, how should NASA balance its major programs in human spaceflight, robotic spaceflight, aeronautics research, and education? In the human spaceflight program, which is larger than all the others put together, should the agency's goal be exploration of the Moon, Mars, or some other destination? What should the top priorities be for NASA's science and aeronautics programs? How? Once these questions are decided, how should their answers be implemented? What new space vehicles are needed? Should they be government-owned or commercial? What should be done with existing programs, such as the space shuttle and the International Space Station?", "This report analyzes these questions and some possible answers. It also addresses a number of cross-cutting issues, such as NASA's interactions with other federal agencies and the growing role of the commercial space industry."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Is NASA For?", "paragraphs": ["During the Eisenhower Administration, after the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial satellite, Sputnik, but before the establishment of NASA, the President's Science and Advisory Committee identified four \"principal reasons for undertaking a national space program\":", "\"the compelling urge of man to explore and to discover\"; \"defense ... to be sure that space is not used to endanger our security ... [and to] be prepared to use space to defend ourselves\"; to \"enhance the prestige of the United States ... and create added confidence in our scientific, technological, industrial, and military strength\"; and \"scientific observation and experiment which will add to our knowledge and understanding of the Earth, the solar system, and the universe.\"", "To these objectives, analysts today add", "the potential for technologies developed for the space program to have direct and indirect (\"spinoff\") economic benefits; the opportunity to use space activities as a tool of international relations, through collaboration on projects such as the International Space Station; and the ability of the space program to inspire students and promote education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).", "These goals form a foundation for U.S. space policies, but policy makers differ in how they should be balanced against each other. Is the urge to discover a sufficient reason to explore space, or must exploration also meet needs here on Earth? Should economic benefits be an explicit focus for NASA or just a positive side effect? To what extent should improving STEM education be a NASA function, as opposed to a consequence of its other functions? Should the emphasis of international space programs be competition or cooperation?", "The priorities that Congress assigns to these objectives may determine how it balances the competing demands of NASA's programs. For example, if Congress believes that national prestige is a high priority, it could choose to emphasize NASA's high-profile human exploration activities, such as exploring Mars or establishing a Moon base. If scientific knowledge is a high priority, Congress could emphasize unmanned missions such as the Hubble telescope and the Mars rovers. If international relations are a high priority, Congress could encourage joint space activities with other nations. If economic benefits are of interest, Congress could focus on technological development, linking NASA programs to the needs of business and industry.", "A report by the National Academies proposed goals similar to those listed above and recommended three criteria to use in balancing their competing demands for resources:", "Steady progress. Each major area should be maintained at a level that allows sustained long-term progress with intermediate goals achieved at a reasonable pace. Stability. Rapid downsizing and abrupt redirection should be avoided because they are disruptive, can take time to recover from, and can create risk as operations experience is lost. Robustness. Sufficient human resources and research infrastructure should be maintained so that the nation can ramp up selected activities quickly in response to changing national needs or scientific breakthroughs.", "The Academies report did not, however, actually employ these criteria to prioritize the goals it proposed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Should NASA Do?", "paragraphs": ["Based on this wide variety of objectives, NASA has established programs in human spaceflight, science, aeronautics, and education. The largest and most visible effort, in human spaceflight, has faced considerable uncertainty about its proper scope and aims.

No humans have visited Mars.) The Vision also directed NASA to return the space shuttle to flight status following the February 2003 Columbia disaster; to complete construction of the International Space Station (ISS) in accord with existing international commitments; and to conclude U.S. participation in the ISS by the end of 2015. The first post- Columbia shuttle flight was launched in July 2005. The other goals remain to be accomplished.", "To advise NASA on implementation of the Vision, President Bush established a Commission on the Implementation of U.S. Space Exploration Policy, chaired by Edward C. \"Pete\" Aldridge, Jr. The Aldridge Commission issued its report in June 2004. In April 2005, NASA established an Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS) to identify a strategy and technical architecture for implementing the Vision. The ESAS issued its final report in November 2005. From then until 2010, the reports of the Aldridge Commission and the ESAS were the baseline for NASA's space exploration plans.", "In the NASA Authorization Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-155 ), Congress endorsed the Vision in broad terms and established several milestones for its implementation, including a statutory mandate to return to the Moon no later than 2020. Nevertheless, it directed NASA to construct an architecture and implementation plan for its human exploration program \"that is not critically dependent on the achievement of milestones by specific dates.\"", "The NASA Authorization Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-422 ) reaffirmed the Vision's broad goals, including the \"eventual\" return to the Moon and missions to other destinations in the solar system. It expressed the sense of Congress that \"America's friends and allies\" should be invited to participate. It directed NASA to take a \"stepping stone approach\" in which lunar exploration activities are designed and implemented with strong consideration to their future contribution to exploration beyond the Moon. It directed that plans for a lunar outpost should not require its continuous occupation and that NASA should use commercial services for its lunar outpost activities \"to the maximum extent practicable.\""], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Program to Implement the Vision", "paragraphs": ["The program for implementing the Vision, as it stood before passage of the 2010 authorization act, addressed the conclusion of the space shuttle and International Space Station programs as well as the development and implementation of new vehicles for taking humans into Earth orbit and then back to the Moon.

Rely on non-U.S. vehicles for human access to space until a replacement vehicle is developed. Terminate U.S. use of the International Space Station at the end of 2015. Under the Constellation program, develop new systems for space exploration: the Ares I rocket to launch astronauts into low Earth orbit, where the International Space Station is located; the Orion crew capsule, to be launched atop Ares I to carry astronauts into orbit and beyond; the Ares V heavy-lift rocket to send astronauts and equipment to the Moon; and the Altair lunar lander and various lunar surface systems.", "Before the Administration's FY2011 budget proposals, no funds were projected for any shuttle flights after the end of 2010. No FY2016 funds were projected for deorbiting the space station. The first crewed flight (or \"initial operating capability\") of Ares I and Orion was scheduled for early 2015. The first return to the Moon, using all the Constellation systems together, was planned for 2020, although NASA acknowledged that meeting that date would be difficult.", "The 2010 authorization act extended U.S. use of the International Space Station through at least 2020 and replaced Constellation with programs to develop commercial services for launching astronauts into low Earth orbit (instead of Ares I); a multipurpose crew vehicle (similar to Orion); and a new heavy-lift rocket (possibly similar to Ares V). The transition from Constellation to these new programs, however, is constrained while NASA operates under the continuing resolution."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issue for Congress: Cost and Schedule", "paragraphs": ["Cost played a central role as congressional policy makers oversaw the Vision's progress and considered proposals to modify it. During the Bush Administration, NASA stressed that its strategy was to \"go as we can afford to pay,\" with the pace of the program set, in part, by the available funding. The original plan in 2004 proposed adding a total of just $1 billion to NASA's budget for FY2005 through FY2009 to help pay for the Vision, with increases thereafter limited to the rate of inflation. Subsequent Administration budgets more than eliminated this increase, and actual appropriations by Congress were even less. As a result, most funding for the Vision has been redirected from other NASA activities, such as the planned termination of the space shuttle program.", "NASA has not provided a cost estimate for the Vision as a whole. In 2004, it projected that developing capabilities for human exploration, not including robotic support missions, would cost a total of $64 billion up through the first human return to the Moon. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) concluded that, based on historical trends, the actual cost could be much higher. In its 2005 implementation plan, NASA estimated that returning astronauts to the Moon would cost $104 billion, not including the cost of robotic precursor missions or the cost of servicing the ISS after the end of the shuttle program. In 2007, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimated the total cost for the Vision as $230 billion over two decades. In April 2009, as directed in the 2008 authorization act, the CBO updated its 2004 budgetary analysis of the Vision. It found that NASA would need an additional $2 billion per year through FY2025 to keep the Vision activities on schedule, not counting probable cost growth in other activities. In October 2009, the Augustine report stated that executing NASA's plans would require an additional $3 billion per year, even with some schedule delays.", "Schedule is closely related to cost. For example, the 2009 CBO analysis found that NASA could maintain its currently planned budget by delaying its return to the Moon by approximately three years. The tradeoffs can be difficult to quantify, however. The Augustine report, unlike the CBO analysis, found that under NASA's budget plans at the time of the report, \"human exploration beyond low-Earth orbit is not viable\" and planned budgets would delay a return to the Moon \"well into the 2030s, if ever.\" Schedule delays were already evident. For example, the initial operating capability for Orion and Ares I, originally planned for 2012, had slipped to 2015; the Augustine committee concluded that 2017 was more likely."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issue for Congress: Why the Moon?", "paragraphs": ["Ever since the Vision was announced, some analysts questioned its choice of the Moon as the headline destination for NASA's human exploration efforts. Some felt that revisiting the destination of the Apollo missions of 1969-1972 was a less inspiring goal than a new target would be. Some doubted the scientific rationale, suggesting that robotic missions to the Moon could accomplish as much or more at lower cost and without risking human lives, or that more could be learned by visiting another destination that has been studied less by previous missions. Some were simply concerned about the cost.", "Supporters countered that the Moon is the closest destination beyond Earth orbit and could serve as a stepping stone for subsequent destinations. As Earth's nearest neighbor, the Moon is of great scientific interest. Missions to the Moon would provide an opportunity to develop and test technologies and gain experience working in space. According to some advocates, the Moon might literally be a staging point for future missions. For some in Congress, concerned about national security or national prestige, the prospect of a manned Chinese mission to the Moon was a strong motivation to reestablish a U.S. presence. For many who supported the Vision, completing it became important in itself; part of the Vision's original purpose was to set a goal for NASA that would give the agency direction and enhance its public support, and some supporters feared that changing the plan would weaken NASA, whether or not a better plan could be devised."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issue for Congress: \"The Gap\" and Utilization of the Space Station", "paragraphs": ["In order to fund the cost of the Vision and because of safety concerns following the Columbia disaster in 2003, NASA intended to end the space shuttle program in 2010 once construction of the ISS was complete.

The shuttle's successors, Orion and Ares I, were not expected to be ready for crewed flight until at least 2015. The difference between these dates is generally referred to as \"the gap.\" Congressional policy makers and others expressed concerns about U.S. access to space during the gap. The NASA Authorization Act of 2005 declared it to be U.S. policy \"to possess the capability for human access to space on a continuous basis.\" Former NASA Administrator Michael Griffin, a strong advocate of the Vision, referred to the gap as \"unseemly in the extreme.\"", "Under current plans, Russian spacecraft will be the only means of access to the ISS for humans during the gap.

It identified five options: two within the existing budget profile and three that would require about an additional $3 billion per year. In the committee's judgment, developing Ares I, Orion, and the other Constellation systems is likely to take longer than NASA currently plans, and the options presented by the committee reflect these expected delays. The options are as follows:", "Option 1: Current Budget, Current Program . This option is the current program, modified only to provide funds for space shuttle flights in FY2011 and for deorbiting the International Space Station in FY2016. The first crewed flight of Ares I and Orion is no earlier than 2017, after the International Space Station has been deorbited. Ares V is not available until the late 2020s, and there are insufficient funds to develop Altair and the lunar surface systems needed for returning to the Moon until well into the 2030s, if ever. Option 2: Current Budget , Extend Space Station, Explore Moon Using Ares\u00a0V Lite . This option extends use of the International Space Station to 2020 and begins a program of lunar exploration using a variant of Ares V known as Ares V Lite. It develops commercial services to transport humans into low Earth orbit. It delivers a heavy-lift capability in the late 2020s, but it does not develop the other systems needed for returning to the Moon for at least the next two decades. Option 3: Additional Budget , Current Program. Like Option 1, this option is the current program, modified to provide funds for space shuttle flights in FY2011 and to deorbit the International Space Station in FY2016. The first crewed flight of Ares I and Orion would still be after the International Space Station is deorbited. The additional funding, however, would permit a human lunar return in the mid-2020s. Option 4: Additional Budget , Extend Space Station, Explore Moon First . Like Option 2, this option extends use of the International Space Station to 2020 and uses commercial services to transport humans into low Earth orbit. The first destination beyond Earth orbit is still the Moon. There are two variants to this option. Variant 4A develops the Ares V Lite for lunar exploration as in Option 2. Variant 4B extends the space shuttle program to 2015 and develops a heavy-lift vehicle for lunar missions that is more directly shuttle-derived. Both variants permit a human lunar return by the mid-2020s. Option 5: Additional Budget, Extend Space Station, Flexible Path for Exploration. Like Option 4, this option extends use of the International Space Station to 2020 and uses commercial services to transport humans into low Earth orbit. Missions beyond Earth orbit, however, follow a \"flexible path\" of increasingly distant destinations\u2014such as lunar fly-bys, rendezvous with asteroids and comets, and Mars fly-bys\u2014without initially attempting a lunar landing. A lunar landing would be possible by the mid to late 2020s. Variant 5A employs the Ares V Lite. Variant 5B uses a commercial heavy-lift rocket derived from the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV). Variant 5C develops a shuttle-derived vehicle for heavy lift as in Variant 4B. (These alternative launch vehicles are discussed further later in this report.)", "Although the committee's report did not recommend any particular one of these options, it made a number of findings and comments that put the options into context:", "Option 1 and Option 2 fit within the current budget profile, but \"neither allows for a viable exploration program. In fact, the Committee finds that no plan compatible with the FY2010 budget profile permits human exploration to continue in any meaningful way.\" The additional funding contemplated in Options 3, 4, and 5 is necessary for \"an exploration program that will be a source of pride for the nation.\" \"The return on investment to both the United States and our international partners would be significantly enhanced by an extension of the life of the [International Space Station]. A decision not to extend its operation would significantly impair U.S. ability to develop and lead future international spaceflight partnerships.\" Commercial services to launch crews into Earth orbit \"are within reach. While this presents some risk, it could provide an earlier capability at lower initial and life-cycle costs than the government could achieve.\" Of the heavy-lift alternatives, Ares V Lite is \"the most capable.\" The commercial EELV derivative \"has an advantage of potentially lower operating costs, but requires significant restructuring of NASA\" including \"a different (and significantly reduced) role.\" A shuttle-derived vehicle would \"take maximum advantage of existing infrastructure, facilities, and production capabilities.\" Variant 4B, which extends operation of the space shuttle to 2015, is \"the only foreseeable way to eliminate the gap in U.S. human-launch capability.\" \"Mars is the ultimate destination for human exploration of the inner solar system; but it is not the best first destination.

NASA officials replied that they were continuing to implement the Constellation program during FY2010 in full compliance with the law, even though they intended to terminate the program in FY2011. Two GAO opinions in May and July 2010 concluded that NASA had not violated the appropriations provision.

In the FY2006 and FY2007 budget cycles NASA had no separate budget for Earth science, and supporters became concerned that this was adversely affecting the field. In late 2006, NASA reorganized the Science Mission Directorate, creating a separate Earth Science Division. The National Research Council recommended in early 2007 that the United States \"should renew its investment in Earth observing systems and restore its leadership in Earth science and applications.\" In response, Congress and the Administration increased the share of NASA's science funding devoted to Earth science from 26% in FY2008 to 32% in FY2010. In addition, NASA allocated 81% of the science funding it received under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-5 ) to Earth science. The Administration's requested budget for FY2011 would provide substantial increases for Earth science funding, including a five-year, $2.1 billion global climate initiative. For FY2011 through FY2013, the NASA Authorization Act of 2010 authorized these increases.", "In recent years, Congress has sought to ensure that NASA's science program includes a balanced variety of approaches to R&D rather than focusing only on certain types of missions. For example, the NASA Authorization Act of 2008 stated that the science program should include space science missions of all sizes as well as mission-enabling activities such as technology development, suborbital research, and research and analysis (R&A) grants to individual investigators. According to the National Research Council, \"practically all relevant external advisory reports have emphasized the importance of mission-enabling activities,\" but determining their proper scale has been challenging \"throughout NASA's history.\" In the past few years, funding for planetary science technology has increased significantly, but funding for Earth science technology has increased only slightly; the astrophysics and heliophysics programs do not have dedicated technology subprograms. Funding for suborbital rocket operations increased from $51 million in FY2008 to $66 million in FY2010, but the trend is unclear as the latter amount was down from $77 million in FY2009. Funding for R&A grants, which NASA controversially proposed to reduce significantly as recently as FY2007, has recovered as the result partly of the Administration's own initiatives and partly of congressional action on appropriations legislation. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 reaffirmed the sense of Congress that \"a balanced and adequately funded set of activities, consisting of research and analysis grants programs, technology development, small, medium, and large space missions, and suborbital research activities, contributes to a robust and productive science program and serves as a catalyst for innovation.\"", "In December 2009, the National Research Council recommended ways to make the mission-enabling activities of NASA's science programs more effective through more active management. These recommendations included establishing explicit objectives and metrics, making budgets more transparent, and clearly articulating the relationships between mission-enabling activities and the ensemble of missions they are intended to support. The NASA Authorization Act of 2008 stated that the technology development program should include long-term activities that are \"independent of the flight projects under development.\" NASA may sometimes find it challenging to balance this independence against the goal of linking mission-enabling activities to the missions they support.", "NASA's science programs have a history of periodic review by the National Academies.

They claim that government funding for aeronautics research can contribute to U.S. competitiveness and is necessary in light of similar programs in Europe and elsewhere. Opponents counter that the aviation industry itself should pay for the R&D it needs. Against the background of this debate, NASA aeronautics programs have focused increasingly on long-term fundamental R&D and on research topics with clear public purposes, such as reducing noise and emissions, improving safety, and improving air traffic control.", "In 2005, Congress directed the President to develop a national policy for aeronautics R&D. The National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), part of the Executive Office of the President, issued this policy in December 2006. The policy established general principles and goals for federal aeronautics activities, laid out the roles and responsibilities of NASA and other agencies, and directed the NSTC to issue a national aeronautics R&D plan at least every two years. The NSTC released the first national aeronautics R&D plan in December 2007 and the second in February 2010.

In the 2008 authorization act, Congress directed NASA to align its fundamental aeronautics research program with these technology challenges \"to the maximum extent practicable within available funding\" and to increase the involvement of universities and other external organizations in that program. It also mandated periodic Academy reviews of the NASA aeronautics program and directed that they include independent estimates of the cost and technical readiness of each mission assessed.

For example, when NASA introduced full-cost accounting in the FY2004 budget request, the stated cost of the aeronautics program increased significantly because facility costs had previously been budgeted in another account. At least partly in response to these concerns, NASA subsequently established a separate Aeronautics Test Program in the aeronautics directorate and a Strategic Capabilities Assets Program outside the directorate. It has also sometimes been difficult for NASA to balance its stewardship of unique aeronautics facilities, often used by other agencies and by industry as well as by NASA itself, against the cost of maintaining those facilities. In 2005, Congress directed NASA to establish a separate account to fund aeronautics test facilities, to charge users of NASA test facilities at a rate competitive with alternative facilities, and not to implement a policy seeking full cost recovery for a facility without giving 30 days' notice to Congress. To accompany the national aeronautics R&D plan, the Aeronautics Science and Technology Subcommittee of the NSTC developed a national aeronautics research, development, test, and evaluation infrastructure plan.

Some human missions beyond Earth orbit could be accomplished with a single Ares V Lite launch.", "Shuttle-derived vehicles would use the same main engines, solid rocket boosters, and external tanks as the space shuttle. They could be either in-line or side-mount. In other words, the payload could be mounted either on top or on the side. One example of the in-line option is the Jupiter design advocated by DIRECT, a group ostensibly led by NASA engineers working anonymously on their own time. The Augustine committee did not compare the in-line and side-mount variants in detail, but it considered the side-mount option to be inherently less safe when carrying a crew. A shuttle-derived launcher would likely be able to lift 90 to 110 metric tons into orbit.", "The Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle program was a U.S. Air Force program that resulted in the development of the Delta IV and Atlas V rockets. Current EELV systems are not rated to carry humans. In testimony to the Augustine committee, the Aerospace Corporation stated that a human-rated variant of the Delta IV Heavy would be capable of carrying Orion to the ISS. A super-heavy EELV variant could carry a cargo payload of about 75 metric tons. The Augustine committee concluded that using an EELV variant to launch Orion would only make sense if a super-heavy EELV variant were to be selected for heavy-lift cargo launch.", "In addition to differences in capability, the Augustine committee found that these alternatives differ in their life-cycle costs, operational complexity, and \"way of doing business.\" The committee concluded that Ares V Lite would be the most capable; that a shuttle derivative would take maximum advantage of existing infrastructure, facilities, and production capabilities; and that an EELV derivative could potentially have the lowest operating costs, but would require a significant restructuring of NASA. The committee noted that each alternative has strong advocates and that \"the claimed cost, schedule, and performance parameters include varying degrees of aggressiveness.\" It did not explicitly recommend any of the alternatives over the others.", "The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 directed NASA to \"extend or modify existing ... contracts\" when developing the new space launch system.

Because of the importance of crew safety, commercial crew transport services would need to include \"a strong, independent mission assurance role for NASA.\" If the service were developed so as to meet commercial needs as well as NASA's, there would be private-sector customers to share operating costs with NASA. In that case, the cost of the program to NASA would be about $5 billion, and a service could be in place by 2016. If the private sector effort were to fail in mid-program, the task of crew transport would revert to NASA. NASA should continue development of Orion and move quickly toward the development of a human-ratable heavy-lift rocket as a fallback option to mitigate this risk.", "The Augustine committee found that the commercial space industry is \"burgeoning,\" and concluded that creating an assured initial market would eventually have the potential\u2014\"not without risk\"\u2014to significantly reduce costs to the government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issue for Congress: Safety", "paragraphs": ["Space travel is inherently dangerous.

NASA's safety system has fallen short of the mark.\" It concluded that \"a broken safety culture,\" including a \"reliance on past success as a substitute for sound engineering practices,\" was an organizational cause of the Columbia disaster. It found that one contributing factor was \"intense schedule pressure,\" which had also been identified as an organizational cause of the space shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986. It recommended that NASA establish a technical engineering authority, reporting directly to the NASA Administrator rather than to the space shuttle program, that independently verifies launch readiness and has sole authority to grant waivers for technical standards. In response to these findings, NASA has made many changes, including the establishment of an independent NASA Engineering and Safety Center under the auspices of the headquarters Office of Safety and Mission Assurance.", "Nevertheless, some analysts see signs that potential problems remain. The deadline of 2010 to complete construction of the space station and stop flying the space shuttle created schedule pressure for both programs until NASA converted it from a hard deadline to a flexible goal (now extended to early 2011). In 2006, NASA decided to a proceed with a shuttle mission, even though the Chief Engineer and the head of the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance recommended against the launch because of an issue with the shuttle ice-frost ramps that they characterized as \"probable/catastrophic.\" Some observers saw signs of \"reliance on past success\" in NASA's justification for this decision: the NASA Administrator disagreed with the \"probable\" characterization because \"we have 113 flights with this vehicle ... and while we've had two loss of vehicle incidents, they've not been due to ice-frost ramps.\" (The two officials who recommended against launch stated that they were comfortable with the decision to overrule them because \"the risk was to the vehicle and not the crew.\") A member of NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel testified in late 2009 that describing safety as a sine qua non \"oversimplifies a complex and challenging problem\" and that NASA \"has given serious consideration only recently\" to the establishment of safety requirements for commercial crew transport services.", "NASA argues that it continues to implement initiatives to improve safety.

Others suggested human missions to asteroids or other solar system destinations.", "The Augustine committee concluded that current technology is insufficiently developed to make a Mars mission safe. It found that Mars is \"unquestionably the most interesting destination in the inner solar system\" and the \"ultimate destination for human exploration\" but \"not the best first destination.\" A spacecraft that lands on either the Moon or Mars must overcome the lunar or Martian \"gravity well\" before returning to Earth. The fuel required to accomplish this makes either destination challenging. As potential alternatives, the Augustine committee considered fly-by missions to either the Moon or Mars, missions that would orbit either the Moon or Mars, missions that would land on the moons of Mars, and missions to near-Earth objects such as asteroids or comets. They also considered missions to various Lagrange points. Lagrange points are special locations in space, defined relative to the orbit of the Moon around the Earth or the Earth around the Sun.

As support for this assertion, they often cite the human missions to repair and upgrade the Hubble telescope. On the other hand, the Hubble repairs and upgrades required extensive planning and the development of new equipment. They were not a real-time response to an unexpected event.
