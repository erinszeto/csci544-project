In response to a petition to add conditions to the list of WTC-related health conditions, the WTCHP administrator is required, within 90 days, to either request a recommendation on action from the WTC Scientific/Technical Advisory Committee (STAC) or make a determination on adding the health condition.

", "In a review of the decision to add cancers to the list of WTC-related health conditions, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the WTCHP administrator used a hazards-based approach to evaluate cancers. This approach evaluated whether exposures in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks were associated with types of cancer but did not evaluate the probability of developing cancer based on a given exposure. A GAO-convened scientific panel indicated that the hazards-based approach the WTCHP administrator used was reasonable given data constraints and the fact that there is a certification process to determine if a cancer or other condition on the list of WTC-related health conditions meets the statutory requirement of being \"substantially likely to be a significant factor in aggravating, contributing to, or causing the illness or health condition.\" The panel also indicated that this approach could have benefited from an independent peer review process.

Of these, award decisions based on economic and noneconomic loss have been made in 856 cases. As a comparison, the original VCF paid awards in 2,880 cases of death. Because there is a regulatory presumption of noneconomic loss of $250,000 for the decedent and an additional $100,000 for the spouse and any dependents, noneconomic loss awards in death cases have the potential to be larger than those in injury cases. ", "Since the VCF's reauthorization in 2015, the number of eligible and awarded death cases has increased significantly. For claims paid prior to reauthorization (Group A claims), awards were paid in 17 death cases. Thus, in less than four years since reauthorization, there has been a nearly 5,000% increase in death awards. Of the 839 death awards paid since reauthorization, 517 were awarded in the period between April 30, 2018, and April 30, 2019, with an additional 43 claims paid in May 2019. Through the end of May 2019, there has been an average of more than 35 new eligibility decisions and more than 48 new awards in death claims per month.", "Although the Special Master does not discuss the causes of the increases in death claims, the nature of many of the compensable medical conditions, especially certain types of cancer with low survival rates, means that many persons eligible for compensation from the VCF will likely die as a result of their WTC-related health conditions, thus possibly making their families eligible for death compensation. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cancer Claims", "paragraphs": ["Cancers were first added to the VCF as compensable conditions in September 2012. Since then, there have been 8,734 cases with at least one form of cancer determined to be eligible for the VCF. As of the end of April 2019, eligible claims with at least one type of cancer made up 37% of all eligible VCF claims. ", "As shown in Table 2 , the most significant growth in cancer claims occurred shortly after cancers were added to the list of WTC-eligible health conditions and also in the most recent year. Between September 30, 2014, and December 31, 2015, the number of eligible claims with cancer as the only compensable condition (cases that would not otherwise be eligible for the VCF if not for the addition of cancer) increased 194% from 472 claims to 1,387 claims. This increase is understandable and expected given that this was early in the period during which cancer claims were first eligible for compensation. However, the recent increase in eligible cancer-only claims as a percentage of all eligible claims is one of the factors that drove the projected program costs, which were just below total available funds in the 2018 assessment, over the funding cap in the 2019 assessment. In 2018, the number of eligible cancer-only claims increased 58%. At the end of 2018, eligible cancer-only claims made up 18% of all eligible claims. ", "The increase in eligible cancer claims is notable for three reasons. First, no types of cancer were compensable when the VCF was originally reopened in 2010 and no cancers were included in the list of WTC-related health conditions created by Congress in the Zadroga Act. Cancers were added to the list of covered conditions by the WTCHP administrator in two determinations made in 2012 and 2013. These determinations resulted in more than 60 types of cancer covering nearly every body system being compensable under the VCF. ", "Neither the VCF nor WTCHP statutes include any specific provisions requiring any follow-up or continuous review of scientific evidence to determine if, in the nearly seven years since these determinations were made, there is any additional evidence to support or refute including these types of cancers in the list of WTC-related health conditions compensable under the VCF. The GAO cited limitations on data available in 2012 as a reason that its scientific panel found the WTCHP administrator's use of a hazards-based rather than probability model to add cancers to the list of WTC-related health conditions reasonable. Given the increases in the number of persons receiving services from the WTCHP and developing cancer in the years since the 2012 and 2013 cancer determinations, there may be additional data to warrant reevaluating the list of covered cancers or evaluating the likelihood of developing cancer after different types of exposures in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. ", "In addition, the VCF covers a wide range of persons from firefighters and police officers who were the first responders to the attacks, to construction and other workers who were involved in debris removal, and to adults and children who were in lower Manhattan at the time of the attacks, all of whom may have had different types and durations of exposure to toxic substances in the aftermath of the attacks. Although the determination that a person's health condition was linked to his or her exposure in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks is based on a combination of duration and nature of exposure, the list of covered conditions, including all cancers except childhood cancer, applies equally to all persons with no accounting for individual exposure experience. ", "Second, the VCF is a program of presumptive eligibility. Thus, when determining eligibility for the VCF, controlling factors such as genetics, age, behaviors such as tobacco use, or exposure to other toxins are not considered and the Special Master does not make a determination as to the probability that a person's exposure in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks caused his or her cancer. Rather, the only requirement that a cancer or other health condition be linked to a person's exposure in the aftermath of the attacks is the WTCHP's determination that such exposure \"is substantially likely to be a significant factor in aggravating, contributing to, or causing the illness or health condition.\" In addition, the WTCHP administrator did not consider the likelihood or probability that any given cancer would occur based on the hazards experienced in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks when cancers were added to list of WTC-related health conditions. ", "This approach is different than the probability of causation model used for some cancer claims under Part B of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA), in which the probability that a person's cancer was caused by occupational exposure to ionizing radiation must be 50% or greater to receive compensation. The VCF's presumptive eligibility model is also in contrast to the probability of causation model recommended by the National Research Council Board on Radiation Effects Research to be used to determine eligibility for benefits under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) for persons who lived near the Nevada Test Site during atmospheric atomic weapons testing. However, the presumptive eligibility model is used for other federal compensation programs, including disability compensation for veterans exposed to radiation and Agent Orange. ", "Third, cancer claims have the potential to result in higher benefits than non-cancer claims. The cap on noneconomic loss awards for cancer claims is $250,000 versus $90,000 for non-cancer claims.

", "Although the Special Master cites the increase in non-responder claims as one of the causes of the increase in VCF benefit costs and the recent projection that program costs will exceed available funding, limitations in the data reported by the VCF make analyzing this potential cost driver difficult. In her congressional testimony, the Special Master states \"At the time of Reauthorization in December 2015, not quite 14% of all VCF awards were paid to non-responders. Today, just about 38% of claims filed are from this population.\" However, this is not a direct comparison, as the Special Master is comparing data on awards with data on claims filed, regardless of whether those claims result in awards without any additional information on the percentage of claims filed that may result in awards.

", "This reauthorization legislation includes the following major components: ", "authorization for the VCF through FY2090, with a deadline of October 1, 2089, to file claims; removal of the cap on VCF funding; appropriations of \"such sums as may be necessary\" for the VCF for each fiscal year through FY2090; payment of the difference between the full award and the actual amount received for all persons who received reduced awards due to the Special Master's actions; authority for the Special Master to exceed the limit on noneconomic loss if it is determined that a person's pain and suffering is of such severity as to make the award \"insufficiently compensatory\"; and a cost of living adjustment, to be made every five years, to the maximum amount of annual income permitted to be considered by the Special Master when determining economic loss (currently $200,000). ", "The reauthorization legislation would not make any changes to the basic eligibility for VCF awards. The legislation also would not specifically address the three drivers of increased VCF costs that the Special Master identified in her 2019 congressional testimony: (1) increases in death claims, (2) cancer claims, and (3) claims from non-responders. However, because this legislation would provide full funding for the VCF not subject to annual appropriations, any increases in program costs would not result in the VCF having insufficient funding to pay all benefits. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that this legislation, if enacted, would result in $6.785 billion in direct spending on benefits and administration between FY2019 and FY2024 and $10.180 billion in spending between FY2019 and FY2029.
