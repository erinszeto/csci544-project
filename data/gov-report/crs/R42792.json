The Title IV-E program, as it is commonly called, provides support for monthly payments on behalf of eligible children, as well as funds for related case management activities, training, data collection, and other costs of program administration. In FY2011, states (including the 50 states and the District of Columbia) spent $12.4 billion under the Title IV-E program and received federal reimbursement of $6.7 billion, or 54% of that spending. At the federal level, the Title IV-E program is administered by the Children's Bureau, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).", "More than two-thirds of all Title IV-E spending supports provision of foster care, which is a temporary living arrangement for children who cannot remain safely in their own homes. Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments are subsidies provided to foster caregivers to support the daily living costs of eligible children. Title IV-E program administration primarily supports caseworker and agency efforts to ensure the safety and well-being of each child in foster care and to plan for, and achieve, permanency for them via family reunification, adoption, or legal guardianship. Just 29% of the $8.3 billion in total (state and federal) Title IV-E foster care spending for FY2011 was used for maintenance payments, while close to half (46%) of those Title IV-E foster care dollars supported program administration (primarily for case planning and case management).", "Close to one-third of all Title IV-E spending (state and federal) supports children in permanent adoption or guardianship placements. Title IV-E adoption assistance payments are monthly subsidies provided for eligible adopted children (most of whom were previously in foster care), for whom the state determined they could not be returned home and that there was a condition or factor that precluded their adoption without assistance (e.g., age, medical condition, or membership in a sibling group). Kinship guardianship assistance payments are ongoing subsidies for eligible children placed with a legal relative guardian, for whom returning home from foster care is not possible or appropriate and for whom the agency also determines adoption is not appropriate. In FY2011, more than 80% of the total spending for Title IV-E adoption assistance ($4.0 billion) and Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance ($51 million) supported ongoing subsidies for eligible children.", "States receiving Title IV-E funding are required to provide foster care and adoption assistance to eligible children. They may also choose to provide kinship guardianship assistance to all eligible children. Federal eligibility for all types of Title IV-E assistance is limited by age. Additional criteria vary by the kind of assistance but often require children to have been removed from low income households. Each month during FY2011, an average of 168,400 children received a Title IV-E foster care maintenance payment and 413,800 received Title IV-E adoption assistance. On a national basis, children who received Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments comprise less than half of all children in foster care and about one-quarter of those receiving ongoing adoption subsidies.", "The number of children in foster care overall, as well as the number of those children receiving Title IV-E foster care support has been in decline for most of the past decade; the amount of money spent for Title IV-E foster care is also declining. During most of the same time period, however, the number of children receiving Title IV-E adoption assistance and the amount of spending for Title IV-E adoption assistance grew rapidly. Although representing a small part of the program now, both the number of children assisted via Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance and the amount of spending for that purpose are expected to increase."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Foster care is a temporary living arrangement for children who cannot remain safely in their own homes.

Most children who leave foster care do so to be reunited with parents or other family members. For some children, however, this is not possible. In those cases, the child welfare agency must work to find a new permanent home for these children and this may be accomplished through adoption or legal guardianship.

However, Congress has long sought to assist states in improving their child welfare services. In exchange for federal funding to support provision of foster care and other child welfare services, states must meet certain federal requirements. Under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, states, territories, and tribes who meet those requirements are entitled to claim partial federal reimbursement for the cost of providing foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance to children who meet federal eligibility criteria.

Some state agencies administer the program centrally, while others supervise the administration of the Title IV-E program by counties. In either case, the state child welfare agency is the recipient of the federal Title IV-E funding and is responsible for ensuring that the Title IV-E program is administered in accordance with federal policy.", "Roughly two-thirds of the Title IV-E dollars spent in FY2011 supported provision of foster care. Further, the very large majority of children who receive Title IV-E adoption assistance were previously in foster care, as were all children who receive Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance. This report begins with a brief discussion of why children come to the attention of the child welfare agency and how they may subsequently enter foster care. It next outlines the requirements states must meet to receive federal Title IV-E funds; the kinds of assistance and activities that can be provided with Title IV-E dollars, and on whose behalf those dollars may be spent; and the way that federal funding is authorized for this program.

The purpose of these investigations is to determine whether abuse or neglect of a child has occurred, or is likely to occur, and, as necessary, to provide services to ensure children are safe and that their families are able to care for and support them. The most common concern that brings children to the attention of child welfare agencies is neglect (either a lack of supervision or a failure to provide for the child's basic needs). Physical abuse is less frequently alleged, followed by sexual abuse, or emotional abuse. ", "In most cases, investigative caseworkers determine that children may safely remain in their own home. (This is true without regard to whether the investigation determines that abuse and/or neglect occurred.) A national survey of children in families investigated for abuse or neglect found that approximately 4 to 6 months after the investigation, 87.1% of the children were living at home (either because they were never removed or because they had already been reunited), 6.1% were living in informal kinship arrangements, and the remaining 6.3% were in formal out-of-home placements (including 2.4% in a formal kin care arrangement, 3.4% in foster family care, and 0.5% in a group setting).", "Investigative caseworkers frequently identify certain underlying factors that directly lead to the child abuse/neglect investigation and/or might jeopardize the ability of that family to safely care for and support a child. These include high stress in the family (e.g., unemployment, drug use, poverty, or neighborhood violence), low social support, trouble paying for basic necessities (e.g., food, shelter, clothing, electricity or heat), substance abuse by the caregiver, a history of domestic violence and/or of child abuse or neglect against the primary caregiver, mental health problems of the caregiver, a recent history of arrest of the primary caregiver, and other factors. In nearly every case, these risk factors are more likely to be identified in families from which children are removed from the home following an investigation as compared to those in which the children remained living in the home. There was no statistically significant difference between children removed from the home and those remaining in the home with regard to two factors: history of domestic violence against the primary caregiver, or current domestic violence against that caregiver.", " Figure 1 shows presence of risk factors in a national sample of families investigated for child abuse or neglect, by whether the child was living in the family home, or outside that home, approximately four months after the investigation.

Foster care, however, is a temporary living arrangement and for nearly every child who enters foster care, the first goal of the agency (and as spelled out in federal policy) is to reunite children with their parents. Figure 1 gives some sense of the challenges that child welfare agencies face in meeting that goal. As part of required case planning for children in foster care, Title IV-E funds are used to assess what services and supports may be needed to enable reunification and to plan for provision of those services. However, Title IV-E may only pay for that work when it is done on behalf of a child who meets Title IV-E eligibility criteria. Title IV-E funding may not be used to pay for any of the services identified as necessary to enable reunification, nor may it be used to provide post-reunification services to ensure the continued success of the family. To support those child welfare purposes, states may rely on funding under Title IV-B of the Social Security Act (both Subpart 1, the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services Program and Subpart 2, the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program). They may also use other federal funding streams that are not wholly dedicated to child welfare purposes but may be used to support child welfare goals. Most states rely on the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant (Title IV-A of the Social Security Act) and the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) (Title XX, Subpart 1 of the Social Security Act) to support their child welfare programs.", "For some children, returning home is not possible and the goal for the child welfare agency with regard to these children is to find them a new safe and permanent home. To facilitate this, Title IV-E funds ongoing adoption assistance and, in states that elect this option, kinship guardianship assistance, as a way to encourage and sustain legally established, new permanent families for children. Under Title IV-E, states provide direct financial assistance to eligible children after they leave foster care for adoption or kinship guardianship. However, as is true with children who are reunited with their parents, states may not use Title IV-E funds to provide post-adoption or post-guardianship support services to those families or their children. Again, the child welfare programs under Title IV-B, as well as TANF and SSBG (to the extent they are available to the child welfare agency) may be used for these purposes.", "Finally, some youth leave, or are expected to leave, foster care because they reach the age at which the state ends foster care support (often age 18), rather than because they return to their families or are placed in a new permanent family. Title IV-E includes unique support for services to these youth. That support is authorized under the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program.

Notable among the many acts that have amended the Title IV-E program since its 1980 enactment are the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (ASFA, P.L. 105-89 ), which emphasized children's safety, along with achieving permanency for children as quickly as possible (particularly via adoption when appropriate); and the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-351 ), which focused new attention on ensuring the well-being of children in foster care, allowed states to choose to extend federal foster care assistance to youth up to age 21, phased in expanded federal eligibility for Title IV-E adoption assistance, and gave states the option of providing kinship guardianship assistance under the Title IV-E program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Policies That Apply for All Three Program Components", "paragraphs": ["In some respects the Title IV-E program encompasses three separate programs\u2014foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance\u2014each with its own eligibility requirements and specific kinds of assistance.

Generally, any program cost authorized by the Title IV-E plan that is not direct financial assistance on behalf of an eligible child is considered an \"administrative\" cost. The kind of \"administrative\" activities that may be supported by Title IV-E are wide ranging. They may include required actions by caseworkers on behalf of individual children, e.g., developing a case plan for a child in foster care; visiting a child in care; preparing for and participating in administrative and court proceedings regarding a child's removal from the home, status in foster care, and permanency plan; and finding a safe and appropriate foster or adoptive home for a child. Other Title IV-E administrative activities include child welfare agency actions on behalf of individual children or in support of the Title IV-E program overall, e.g., conducting background checks of prospective caregivers, establishing and implementing licensing standards for foster family homes and institutions, developing required program policies, and participating in federal compliance reviews. These examples are meant to be illustrative and do not describe every kind of administrative activity that may be supported under Title IV-E.

Spending for Title IV-E foster care training purposes has not increased, despite broadened authority (enacted in 2008) for states to claim federal Title IV-E support for this purpose.", "Finally, Title IV-E foster care spending under child welfare demonstration projects, which states were first required to report on separately for FY2000, jumped significantly in FY2007 and FY2008 as several large projects were implemented. This category refers to spending under what are often referred to as \"waiver projects.\" For FY2011, more than 90% of the spending reported in this category was related to the projects being implemented in Florida (on a statewide basis) and in California (in Los Angeles and Alameda counties). Waiver projects must be designed to be cost neutral to the federal government. Apart from certain project development and evaluation costs, no state should expect to receive more Title IV-E funding under the demonstration project than it would if the project were not in place. However, Title IV-E funding spent under authority of the demonstration project may support a broader range of activities, including services, and be provided to individuals who would not otherwise be eligible for Title IV-E assistance. In all cases, however, the kind of Title IV-E spending must be authorized under the state's approved waiver project.

Payment rates for children living with kin are expected to be lower and rates for children placed in group or institutional settings are expected to be higher.

The majority of non-relative and relative caregivers of children removed from their homes have income above the poverty level. However, this is less likely to be true for relative caregivers than for non-relative caregivers.

A TANF \"child-only\" payment (typically less than a Title IV-E foster care maintenance payment) may be paid to a child in foster care who is not eligible for Title IV-E and who is living with a relative. This kind of TANF assistance may be provided without regard to the income of that relative. Separately, states may also use TANF to provide foster care maintenance payments to other children in foster care (whether or not they are living with a relative), if this kind of spending was authorized under the state's prior law AFDC Emergency Assistance (EA) program. (Funding for that program was rolled into the TANF block grant when it was created in 1996.) Although states are known to spend significant sums of TANF funds for child welfare purposes, the extent to which those funds are used to provide monthly assistance, as opposed to other child welfare services (e.g., family support or family preservation) is less clear. Other federal funding streams sometimes tapped by states for monthly room and board payments include Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security (Title II) \"survivors\" or disability benefits for children in foster care who meet the eligibility criteria for those federal programs. In addition, states may use Medicaid to supplement payments for children with special medical needs or those whose regular care must include medical treatment. However, the use of Medicaid for any child welfare purposes has declined in recent years.

Under the prior law AFDC program, states were able to establish their own \"need standards\" or income test for purposes of determining eligibility for cash assistance. While those standards vary significantly by state, they are generally quite low. The median state need standard (annualized for a family of three) is $7,740. That amount represented roughly 60% of the federal poverty guideline for a family of that size in 1996 but represents just 41% of the federal poverty guideline for a family of three in 2012.

At the same time, the multi-faceted nature of Title IV-E foster care eligibility\u2014encompassing specific court findings, requiring placement in a licensed setting, stipulating requirements related to citizenship or immigration status, requiring removal from a relative's home and other criteria\u2014means that income is not always the reason children in foster care are ineligible for federal foster care support. ", "Remembering that there are multiple Title IV-E foster care eligibility criteria may help to explain why the relationship between a state's AFDC income test and its coverage rate does not always appear straightforward. If the income standard was the only relevant factor for determining a state's Title IV-E coverage rate, then presumably states with higher income tests would be more likely to have higher Title IV-E foster care coverage rates.

Parent's income was cited as a cause for ineligibility in each of those 26 states; although, its significance in a given state ranged widely from almost no cases in some of those states to the large majority in others. Across all of the reporting states, it was the reason for ineligibility in fewer than half of the cases (40%). Other factors frequently cited by states as reasons for a child's ineligibility included, a lack of required judicial determinations (25 states), unlicensed homes or facilities (22 states), and ineligible placement settings (18 states). Again, the significance of these factors varied greatly by state. However, on average, among the states that reported some children were found ineligible because they lacked required judicial determinations, or were in unlicensed or otherwise ineligible homes or other placement settings, between 10%\u201320% of the ineligible cases were linked to these factors. Finally, 17 states cited a wide range of \"other\" reasons that led to ineligible cases in their jurisdictions, including several that\u2014like the family income requirement\u2014are linked to AFDC eligibility rules. These included child must be deprived of parental care or support, child must be removed from the home of a specified relative, and resources in home of removal must not exceed specified limit.

However, depending on the specific criteria, this may be more or less possible. For example, if a state increases the use of relative placements for children in foster care (a practice supported in federal policy), this might also increase Title IV-E foster care ineligibility as the practice of routinely licensing relatives is relatively recent in some states and some continue to report that relatives resist, or are unable to meet, foster family home licensing standards. Unlike the income test, however, states may attempt to address this issue by more actively seeking to license relatives, including by using the authority (granted in statute) to waive any non-safety licensing standards for children placed with relatives. Separately, if children are found not eligible for Title IV-E foster care because the required judicial determinations were not made, or were not made in the specified time frames (see Table 2 ), a state may review its procedures to ensure courts have time to act and may also work to raise awareness of the court concerning needed findings and their time frame. At the same time, any improvement will also likely depend on the cooperation of the courts and their willingness to engage with the child welfare agency on this issue.", "The share of children eligible for Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments is significant to federal funding for other kinds of Title IV-E foster care purposes because it is a primary factor in determining the amount of \"administrative\" and other program costs that states may assign to the Title IV-E program.

Both the new state plan requirements and the increased attention to compliance were in large measure meant to improve outcomes for children and families served by the state child welfare agencies. Some examples of requirements that states must meet include to ensure an initial permanency hearing at 12 months following a child's entry to foster care (rather than previous 18 months); petition a court for the termination of parental rights in cases where children are not going to be reunited with their parents; conduct background checks for prospective foster care and adoptive parents, including finger-print checks of FBI-maintained databases and checks of state child abuse registries; make a plan for the educational stability of children in foster care; help youth about to \"age-out\" of foster care develop a transition plan; identify and provide notice to, relatives when a child enters foster care; and annually check any credit reports associated with older children in care and help those children address any irregularities in the reports. , ", "Outside those specific Title IV-E plan requirements noted here, the 2001 implementation of federal \"conformity reviews,\" including the Child and Family Services Review and the Title IV-E Eligibility Review has also added to Title IV-E administrative costs.

In its report on the legislation that became the 1980 Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act, the House Ways and Means Committee wrote that the \"primary objective\" of the bill was to \"promote reforms in State foster care and child welfare services programs that will significantly increase the number of children placed in permanent homes. Those reforms would not be complete without the provision of adoption assistance.\" ", "All states were required to establish a Title IV-E Adoption Assistance component as part of their Title IV-E program (no later than the first day of FY1983). By FY1984 there were 11,600 children receiving Title IV-E adoption assistance on an average monthly basis. That number rose steadily, reaching 146,900 for FY1997. In November 1997 Congress enacted the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA, P.L. 105-89 ). Among other purposes, that law sought to increase the number of children who left foster care for permanent adoptive homes. It sped up the permanency planning time frame for children who entered foster care, and also required states to take steps to ensure the legal availability of a child for adoption if the child had been in care for a certain length of time or if there was no requirement to make \"reasonable efforts\" to reunite the child with his or her parent. ASFA also authorized Adoption Incentives to provide cash awards to states that increased adoptions of children out of foster care. The law's enactment was followed by strong growth in the number of children adopted with public child welfare agency involvement. That number stood at roughly 31,000 in FY1997, grew to more than 51,000 by FY2000 and\u2014despite a significant decrease in the number of children in foster care across this time period (i.e., a decline in the pool of children out of which most special needs adoptions occur)\u2014has remained at or above 50,000 adoptions in all but one fiscal year, through FY2011. Adoptions out of foster care also began to occur more quickly in this time period. The average length of time a child who was adopted from foster care had spent in care declined by roughly one year, from 46 months for those adopted in FY2000 to 34 months for those adopted in FY2011. ", "The increased number of children adopted from foster care helped to drive significant growth in the number of children who receive Title IV-E adoption assistance. As of FY1997, there were about 146,400 children receiving Title IV-E adoption assistance on an average monthly basis. That number rose to 285,600 during FY2002\u2014the first year in which the number of children receiving Title IV-E adoption assistance surpassed the number who were receiving Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments\u2014and it climbed to 423,200 by FY2010. States reported the first ever decline in the Title IV-E adoption assistance caseload for FY2011, when an estimated 413,800 received that assistance on a monthly basis. ", "Some of the reported caseload decline for FY2011 might be due to children who joined the caseload following ASFA and are now leaving it because of age. (In most cases, adoption assistance does not extend beyond age 18, although there are situations in which it may continue until age 21.) Separately, the decline may be related to those federal adoption assistance eligibility criteria that are linked to the income test and other requirements of the prior law cash welfare program known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). While Congress has acted to phase out those federal eligibility criteria for purposes of Title IV-E adoption assistance, the AFDC criteria are expected to continue to apply to the majority of adopted children until at least FY2015 and will not be entirely irrelevant to Title IV-E adoption assistance eligibility until the first day of FY2018. Apart from these potential reasons for the change in the caseload, some of the reported \"decline\" might also be related to data quality concerns. Specifically, there were significant changes in the reporting form used to collect data on the number of children receiving Title IV-E adoption assistance, and that form first went into effect with FY2011. Figure 5 shows the change in Title IV-E foster care and adoption assistance caseloads beginning with FY1984.

To receive reimbursement for adoption assistance expenses, states must meet all of the same requirements necessary to receive Title IV-E foster care funding, including having an approved Title IV-E plan and meeting data collection and reporting requirements. Further, states are required to enter into a written adoption assistance agreement with the adoptive parent(s) of any adopted child determined to have special needs. Under that agreement, the state must make payments for non-recurring adoption expenses to the adoptive parents of the special needs child and, if the child meets additional federal eligibility criteria, it may make ongoing monthly adoption subsidies to those parents on the child's behalf.

Program administration costs are reimbursed at 50% and include reimbursement for non-recurring adoption expenses that are related to the legal costs of finalizing an adoption as well as other program administration costs. Finally, as discussed above, program-related training costs (related to the adoption assistance component of the Title IV-E program) are reimbursed at 75% in most cases. As is true with the foster care component of the Title IV-E program, states with an approved Title IV-E plan may submit adoption assistance claims to HHS, on a quarterly basis, showing all eligible costs incurred and they are entitled to reimbursement for the federal share of those costs. States may submit these claims any time within two years of incurring an eligible expense.

Title IV-E adoption assistance administrative spending (reimbursed at 50% in all states) has represented between 16% and 18% of total Title IV-E adoption assistance spending annually over the past decade. Less administrative spending is expected under the Title IV-E adoption assistance program (as compared to the Title IV-E foster care program) because there are far more limited purposes for which federal reimbursement of those costs may be claimed. This is because most of the policies and other procedures required under the Title IV-E plan\u2014and for which federal Title IV-E support is available\u2014apply only to children in foster care. (For example, none of the protections offered to children via the case review system are applicable to children once they have left foster care for an adoptive home.)", "The federal share of Title IV-E adoption assistance funding is typically between 54.0% and 54.5% of the total (state and federal) spending for the program. However, it reached 60% of Title IV-E adoption assistance spending in both FY2009 and FY2010 and was close to 58% for FY2011. The larger federal share of Title IV-E adoption assistance funding in those years is tied to temporary enhanced federal support provided to states via the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 , as amended by P.L. 111-226 ). As discussed above, that enhanced funding ended as of June 30, 2011. As of August 30, 2012, states had obligated more than $502 million in federal Title IV-E adoption assistance spending under this temporary provision, most of this in FY2009 ($195 million) and FY2010 ($209 million). ", "Combined state and federal spending under the Title IV-E adoption assistance component rose rapidly between FY1997 and FY2002, continued to rise at a slower pace through FY2010, and showed its first ever decline in FY2011. As noted above, FY2011 was also the first year in which states reported some decline in the adoption assistance caseload. It is not possible to know yet whether the lower spending represents the start of a trend or if it is anomalous (perhaps reflecting a data quality issue due to states' use of a new reporting form). However, as part of its mid-session review of the FY2013 budget (conducted in the summer 2012), HHS assumed continued annual growth in the Title IV-E adoption assistance caseload of between 3% to 5% through FY2017 and it estimates federal outlays for Title IV-E adoption assistance of $2.527 billion for FY2013 with annual growth in those outlays of between 4% and 7% through FY2017."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Adoption Assistance Eligibility Criteria", "paragraphs": ["No child may be eligible for Title IV-E adoption assistance without being determined as a child with \"special needs.\" However, not all special needs children qualify for Title IV-E adoption assistance.

This pathway is also available for an applicable child under effectively the same rules.", "As part of expanding federal Title IV-E adoption assistance coverage to include (as of the first day of FY2018) nearly all children adopted from foster care and determined to have special needs, Congress required states to re-invest any state savings resulting from this broadened federal support in other child welfare-related child and family services, including post adoption services. To implement this provision, HHS required states to provide a signed assurance that they would meet this requirement. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act (2011, P.L. 112-34 ) further required states to document how these re-invested funds are spent, including for post adoption services. Accordingly, HHS has required states to amend, and re-submit an assurance that they will reinvest any state savings as required by P.L. 110-351 , to further assure that they will document this spending as required.

By contrast, the data below are percentages of the total universe of adoptions completed with public child welfare agency involvement, including those receiving or not receiving assistance, and it includes only those children who were adopted during a given fiscal year.", "Given that adoption assistance payments are generally provided to children who meet special needs criteria and, as discussed above, the federal government is committed to providing support to nearly all special needs adoptees as of FY2018, this decline is expected to be reversed. However, that reversal may take several years. The Title IV-E adoption assistance pathway most frequently used has been, and presumably continues to be, the pathway that is linked to the eligibility criteria of the prior law AFDC program. Under this pathway, a child must have been removed from a home that met the income standards of that prior law cash welfare program. Given that in nearly three-fourths of all states, the applicable AFDC income standard is below 50% of the poverty line this criteria may be expected to depress federal eligibility for as long as it continues to apply to some children.", "FY2011 represented only the second year of the phase-in of new eligibility rules that remove that income standard from eligibility for federal Title IV-E adoption assistance. During that year, children for whom an adoption assistance agreement was executed after they had reached age 14 or older, did not need to meet income criteria to be found eligible for Title IV-E adoption assistance. Given that just between 7% or 8% of the adoptions finalized in FY2011 were of children age 14 or older (see Table 10 ), the AFDC income criteria are expected to have been applied to the large majority of children for whom Title IV-E adoption assistance was determined (in both FY2010 and FY2011). Further, the median age of children adopted from foster care has held constant at just above five years for at least half a decade. Because the median age represents the point at which half of the group was adopted at an older age and half at a younger age, it's likely that the \"applicable child\" eligibility rules\u2014i.e., the eligibility rules that apply without regard to income status of the home from which a child was removed\u2014will not apply to a majority of children adopted from foster care in a given year until at least FY2015.

Enactment of this form of Title IV-E assistance followed more than a decade of state experimentation with subsidized guardianship programs both independently, and under child welfare demonstration projects (as authorized by Section 1130 of the Social Security Act). In a 2007 report, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended that Congress consider enacting federal support of guardianship as a way to reduce the disproportionate representation of African American children in foster care. ", "Like the foster care and adoption assistance components of the Title IV-E program, this federal support is authorized on a permanent and open-ended basis. However, states are not required to provide this assistance to eligible children. Instead a state may choose to amend its Title IV-E plan to provide for this kind of assistance. If a state amends its plan to add a kinship guardianship assistance component, it must enter into a written and binding kinship guardianship agreement with the prospective relative guardians of eligible children. As of early September 2012, 31 states had submitted a Title IV-E plan amendment to enable them to seek federal reimbursement for kinship guardianship assistance provided on behalf of eligible children. The plan amendment for one of those states (Virginia) remained under review, but all of the others had been approved. Through FY2011, most of those states had not yet submitted any claims for federal reimbursement of Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance. However, states may seek this reimbursement for up to two years from the date on which they incurred the expense\u2014provided the expense was incurred on or after the effective date of their plan amendment.

A state does not need to have an approved Title IV-E plan amendment related to kinship guardianship assistance to make these Title IV-E claims (but it may). Through FY2011, three states had submitted post-demonstration related kinship guardianship assistance claims. Two of those states have an approved Title IV-E plan that includes kinship guardianship assistance (Illinois and Michigan) and one state does not (Iowa). ", "For states providing kinship guardianship assistance under an approved Title IV-E plan amendment, the same general rules apply with regard to the general kinds of costs and the amount of federal reimbursement that may be claimed. Kinship guardianship assistance payments made on behalf of eligible children are reimbursed at the state's FMAP (which may range from 50% to 83%). Administrative costs for the program may be reimbursed at 50%. As is true for Title IV-E adoption assistance, the kinds of administrative claims that may be made are generally more limited than those for foster care (in large part because once a child is no longer in foster care the requirements for case planning and review no longer apply). However, states are required to provide a relative guardian with funds necessary to meet the full non-recurring costs of finalizing a legal guardianship or $2,000, whichever is less, and they may claim federal reimbursement of 50% of the cost of that assistance. Finally, states may also seek reimbursement for Title IV-E program training related to serving children who receive Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance.

Further, the law, as amended by P.L. 110-351 , requires states to negotiate in good faith with any tribe in the state that seeks to enter into an agreement with the state to operate some or all parts of a Title IV-E program for children under tribal authority. The federal Title IV-E reimbursement rate (paid to a state) for children under tribal authority who are covered by a Title IV-E agreement is equal to the tribal FMAP (as described below and which may be greater than a state's FMAP but not less than that amount).

", "The large majority of Title IV-E provisions apply to tribes seeking direct Title IV-E funding and states in the same manner. However, in the case of a tribe, the law modifies the Title IV-E plan requirement related to statewide operation, requiring instead that a tribe define the service area or areas that are to be covered in the plan. Tribal Title IV-E plans must also include evidence demonstrating that the tribe has not had any uncorrected significant or material audit exceptions under federal grants or contracts that directly relate to the administration of social services for the three years prior to the date on which the tribe submits its Title IV-E plan for approval. Further, the law also clarifies that, under a tribal Title IV-E plan, licensing of foster family homes or child care institutions must be done by an established tribal authority.

For children in foster care under a tribal Title IV-E plan, the law stipulates that the AFDC rules of the state in which the child lived when he/she was removed from his/her home (as those rules were in effect on July 16, 1996) apply for purposes of determining the child's Title IV-E eligibility. As noted above, tribal licensing standards apply for purposes of approving or licensing tribal foster family homes and tribal child care institutions.

Therefore, under a tribal Title IV-E plan, background checks for prospective foster or adoptive parents must meet all of the requirements included in Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. These checks are similar, but not identical to background checks implemented in Indian country under the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Act.", "Like states, tribes seeking direct Title IV-E funding must have an approved Title IV-E plan that points to tribal law or policy that meets federal requirements for the program and they must also have an approved Child and Family Services Plan, under which they receive Title IV-B, Subpart 1 (Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services Program) funding.

A tribal FMAP (or reimbursement rate) must never be lower than the rate of reimbursement for any state in which the tribe is located and may not be higher than 83%. As is the case for states, tribal training costs under the Title IV-E program are to be reimbursed at 75% of the tribe's eligible spending and Title IV-E child placement, data collection and reporting, and any other costs necessary for the proper and efficient administration of the program are to be provided at 50% of the tribe's eligible spending. ", "With a few exceptions (which are the same as those provided for states as described in the body of this report), tribes may only seek federal reimbursement for costs related to children who are eligible for Title IV-E assistance. Therefore, tribes operating a Title IV-E program must be able to accurately determine (subject to periodic federal review) Title IV-E eligibility in order to receive any federal support under the program. For training and administrative claims, tribes must have a valid cost allocation methodology that determines both what share of training, child placement, and other program administration costs are done on behalf of Title IV-E eligible children, as well as a method to determine what part of the administrative and training costs are allocable to Title IV-E. HHS notes that\u2014while Title IV-E program rules, and general HHS cost allocation principles apply\u2014the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is the \"cognizant\" agency for purposes of tribal cost allocation.

However, certain federal laws explicitly provide that funds received by a tribe via a limited number of specific programs may serve as \"non-federal\" dollars in other programs. Accordingly, tribes may use any federal funds from such a program to provide the \"non-federal\" share of Title IV-E spending. In addition, tribes are permitted to use in-kind third party expenditures to meet the non-federal share of Title IV-E administrative and training costs.

Tribes with an approved planning document for a TACWIS may make Title IV-E claims for federal reimbursement that are related to the development of a data collection system (including hardware costs). Those tribes may also submit claims for federal reimbursement related to the operation of a required Title IV-E data collection and reporting system.

Those requirements remain unchanged by the authorization of direct federal support to tribes under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. Separately, for purposes of ensuring continued Title IV-E eligibility and/or payments (as well as Medicaid eligibility), the Fostering Connections Act required HHS to regulate on the issue of transferring care and placement responsibility of a child from a state child welfare agency to a tribal child welfare agency.
