{"id": "R42471", "title": "Indian Gaming: Legal Background and the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA)", "released_date": "2012-04-09T00:00:00", "summary": ["In the 1980s, a number of Indian tribes developed high-stakes bingo and other gaming operations to raise non-federal revenue to fund their governments. In 1988, after the Supreme Court held, in California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, that federal and tribal interests in Indian gaming preempted state law such that state regulation of gaming did not apply to tribal gaming operations on tribal land, Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA). IGRA provides a statutory basis for Indian tribes to conduct gaming on \"Indian lands\" and establishes a regime for regulating Indian gaming. It prohibits gaming on newly acquired land\u2014that is, land acquired in trust after October 17, 1988\u2014subject to two exceptions: the \"two part determination\"; and, land taken in trust as part of a land settlement, restoration of land for a restored tribe, or the initial reservation of a newly acknowledged tribe. In establishing a framework for regulating Indian gaming, IGRA was intended to balance the interests of the tribes, the states, and the federal government in Indian gaming and apportion responsibility for regulating it accordingly. To do this, IGRA divides Indian gaming into three classes: class I includes traditional or social gaming and is subject to exclusive tribal regulation; class II covers bingo and similar games and is subject to tribal regulation and oversight by the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC); and, class III includes all other gaming, including casino gaming or Las Vegas-style gaming, and generally can only be conducted pursuant to tribal-state compacts that must be approved by the Secretary of the Interior. IGRA also created the NIGC to provide regulation of Indian gaming on the federal level.", "The tribal-state compact is the key to tribal casino gaming. Recognizing that some states might simply stonewall tribes and refuse to negotiate class III gaming compacts, Congress required that upon a request from a tribe to negotiate a compact, a state must negotiate in good faith. In order to create an incentive for states to negotiate in good faith, IGRA provided that tribes could sue states in federal district court for failing to negotiate in good faith. IGRA prescribes a series of steps to ensure that ultimately a tribe would be able to engage in class III gaming even over the state's objections. However, in Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, the Supreme Court held that Congress did not have authority under the Indian Commerce Clause to waive the states' sovereign immunity to suits by tribes to enforce the good faith negotiation requirement. This decision, therefore, removed IGRA's practical guarantee that tribes would be able to engage in class III gaming over the objections of the state and gave states a veto over tribal class III gaming\u2014a state can simply refuse to negotiate a class III compact to deny a tribe the ability to engage in class III gaming. Increasingly, states have demanded significant revenue sharing and non-gaming concessions in exchange for class III compacts.", "In the last five years, there have been several bills introduced in Congress to amend IGRA, primarily to restrict off-reservation gaming. Two bills have been introduced in the 112th Congress to amend IGRA. H.R. 4033, the Giving Local Communities a Voice in Tribal Gaming Act, would give local jurisdictions the right to veto a class III gaming operation that the state has agreed to in a compact. S. 771, the Tribal Gaming Eligibility Act, would restrict the availability of off-reservation land for gaming by requiring that tribes demonstrate, by meeting certain criteria, that they have modern and historical ties to the land on which they propose to game."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Today, Indian gaming is big business. In 2010, 237 of the 565 federally recognized tribes operated 422 tribal gaming enterprises which generated $25.6 billion in revenues. Twenty-eight states have some form of Indian gaming. Indian gaming accounted for 25% of the total revenues of the legal gaming industry and is its fastest-growing segment.", "Indian gaming started out small. In the 1980s, when the federal government severely cut funds for Indian tribes, Indian tribes began to turn to high-stakes bingo and other gaming to raise money to fund tribal government operations. The Department of the Interior and other federal agencies actively encouraged tribal bingo to raise revenue to fund tribal governments. However, the legality of these operations was uncertain. Local and state authorities threatened to shut down these operations, claiming that they violated state law. Although federal courts enjoined state enforcement actions, states continued to pursue them. The legality of Indian gaming under federal law was also questionable. Meanwhile, a number of bills were introduced in Congress to regulate the growing Indian gaming industry. ", "In 1987, in California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians , the Supreme Court settled that Indian tribes could engage in gaming on tribal land free from state law. The Court held that federal and tribal interests supporting tribal gaming preempted state laws regulating tribal gaming on tribal land. It did not address federal authority over Indian gaming. ", "Cabazon focused congressional efforts to regulate Indian gaming that culminated in the passage of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA). IGRA provides a statutory basis for Indian tribes to conduct gaming on \"Indian lands\"; establishes a framework for regulating Indian gaming that divides authority between tribes, states, and the federal government; and created the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) with authority to regulate tribal gaming on the federal level. IGRA prohibits gaming on most land acquired in trust after its effective date, October 17, 1988. However, there are important exceptions for certain newly acquired lands.", "For the purposes of regulation, IGRA divided Indian gaming into three classes: class I gaming includes social or traditional gaming played for prizes of minimal value and is subject to exclusive tribal regulation; class II gaming includes bingo and similar games and non-banked card games, and is subject to regulation by the tribes and NIGC, and may be conducted only in states that allow such gaming; and, class III gaming includes all other games and may be conducted only pursuant to tribal-state compacts approved by the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) in states that allow such gaming or pursuant to procedures approved by the Secretary under circumstances specified by IGRA. ", "IGRA also created the NIGC. NIGC has responsibility to monitor class II gaming and to approve tribal gaming ordinances and management contracts, and authority to impose fines and close gaming operations based on a violation of IGRA, NIGC regulations, or tribal gaming ordinances. ", "Class III gaming is the most lucrative class of gaming, and a tribal-state compact is the key to a tribe's ability to engage in class III gaming. IGRA requires that states negotiate class III gaming compacts in \"good faith.\" In order to provide states with an incentive to negotiate class III gaming compacts, IGRA provided that tribes may sue states in federal district court to enforce the good faith requirement. Upon a judicial finding of bad faith, IGRA provided a mechanism by which tribes may engage in class III gaming in the face of recalcitrant states. However, in Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida , the Supreme Court held that Congress did not have authority under the Indian Commerce Clause to waive the states' sovereign immunity to lawsuits by tribes to enforce the requirement that states negotiate class III gaming compacts in good faith. Seminole shifted the balance of power struck in IGRA between the tribes and the states in favor of the states by taking away the tribes' recourse when states refuse to negotiate class III compacts or demand concessions prohibited by IGRA. Increasingly, states have demanded that tribes agree to share gaming revenues and make concessions on issues unrelated to gaming in order to obtain class III gaming compacts. ", "More recently, Congress's attention has focused primarily on off-reservation gaming\u2014that is, gaming on Indian lands located away from a tribe's reservation. There have been several bills introduced which would amend IGRA to limit tribes' ability to game on land located away from their reservations.

Both of these acts made it a federal crime to conduct gaming in Indian country if that gaming would violate state law if it were conducted in the state. In addition, the Johnson Act prohibited gaming devices, such as slot machines, in Indian country.

The Cabazon and Morongo Bands of Mission Indians are two federally recognized tribes with reservations in Riverside County, California. Each Band conducted bingo on its reservation pursuant to a tribal ordinance approved by the Secretary. Cabazon also had a card club. All the tribes' games were open to the public and played predominantly by non-Indians. The profits from these games were the tribes' sole source of income and the games were a major source of employment for tribal members. ", "The state sought to enforce Section 326.5 of the California penal code. Section 326.5 does not strictly prohibit bingo. Rather it permits it under certain circumstances: the games must be operated and staffed by members of designated charitable organizations who may not be compensated for their work; profits must be kept in separate accounts and used only for charitable purposes; and, prizes may not exceed $250 per game. Riverside County also sought to apply its ordinances regulating bingo and prohibiting the card games. The federal district court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit both held that the state and the county did not have authority over the tribal bingo and card games. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Majority Opinion", "paragraphs": ["The Supreme Court began its analysis by noting that \"tribal sovereignty is dependent on, and subordinate to, only the Federal Government, not the States. It is clear, however, that state laws may be applied to tribal Indians on their reservations if Congress has expressly so provided.\" California and the county argued that Congress provided for their authority over the tribal games under Public Law 280 and OCCA. ", "Public Law 280 granted to certain states, including California, criminal and civil adjudicatory jurisdiction over Indian country. Therefore \"when a State seeks to enforce a law within an Indian reservation under the authority of Pub. L. 280, it must be determined whether the law is criminal in nature, and thus fully applicable to the reservation \u2026, or civil in nature, and applicable only as it may be relevant to private civil litigation in state court.\" ", "Rejecting California's argument that its gaming laws were criminal in nature because they carried criminal penalties, the Court held that the difference between laws that are criminal in nature and those that are civil in nature depends on whether the law is \"prohibitory\" or \"regulatory.\" \"The shorthand test is whether the conduct at issue violates the State's public policy.\" The Court concluded, \"[i]n light of the fact that California permits a substantial amount of gambling activity, including bingo, and actually promotes gambling through its state lottery, we must conclude that California regulates rather than prohibits gambling in general and bingo in particular.\" Because Section 326.5 was regulatory in nature, Public Law 280 did not authorize California to enforce it on the reservations.", "The Court also rejected the state's and county's argument that they had authority to enforce state law on the reservations under OCCA. \"There is nothing in OCCA indicating that the States are to have any part in enforcing federal criminal laws or are authorized to make arrests on Indian reservations that in the absence of OCCA they could not effect.... [T]here is no warrant for California to make arrests on reservations and thus, through OCCA, enforce its gambling laws against Indian tribes.\"", "The tribes urged the Court to simply affirm the lower court without further analysis, relying on the statement from McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Comm'n that \"'state laws generally are not applicable to tribal Indians on an Indian reservation except where Congress has expressly provided that State laws shall apply.'\" However, the Court noted that the law is not that black and white. In particular, the Court noted two cases concerning on-reservation tribal sales of cigarettes to non-Indians in which the Court held that even though Congress did not expressly authorize the states to apply its sales tax on the tribes, the state could require the tribes to collect state sales tax. Because Cabazon also involved a \"state burden on tribal Indians in the context of their dealings with non-Indians,\" the Court determined that:", "[d]ecision in this case turns on whether state authority is pre-empted by the operation of federal law; and state jurisdiction is pre-empted if it interferes or is incompatible with federal and tribal interests reflected in federal law, unless the state interests at stake are sufficient to justify the assertion of state authority. The inquiry is to proceed in light of traditional notions of Indian sovereignty and the congressional goal of Indian self-government, including its overriding goal of encouraging tribal self-sufficiency and economic development.", "The Court characterized the federal goals of \"encouraging tribal self-sufficiency and economic development\" as \"important.\" In support of that conclusion, the Court cited a number of executive branch policies and actions to demonstrate the magnitude of these interests: a statement by the President that, as part of the overriding policy of self-determination, tribes needed to reduce their dependence on federal funds; the Department of the Interior's (Interior's) promotion of tribal bingo enterprises by making grants and guaranteeing loans to construct bingo facilities, approving tribal ordinances establishing and regulating tribal bingo, reviewing tribal bingo management contracts, and issuing detailed guidelines governing that review; and the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Health and Human Services providing financial assistance for the construction of bingo facilities. The Court wrote that those policies and actions, \"which demonstrated the Government's approval and active promotion\" of tribal bingo, were \"of particular relevance\" because gaming was the tribes' sole source of revenues and without it, they would not be able to realize the federal policy goals of self-determination and economic self-sufficiency.", "The state and county sought to minimize these interests by arguing that the tribes were merely marketing an exemption from state law. In Washington v. Confederated Tribes of the Colville Indian Reservation , the Court \"held that the State could tax cigarettes sold by tribal smokeshops to non-Indians, even though it would eliminate their competitive advantage and substantially reduce revenues used to provide tribal services, because the Tribes had no right to market an exemption from state taxation to persons who would normally do their business elsewhere.\" The Court distinguished the revenue generated from gaming from the revenue generated by cigarette sales based on the degree to which the tribes \"generated value\" in the service or product sold: ", "[In Confederated Tribes, w]e stated that it is painfully apparent that the value marketed by the smokeshops to persons coming from outside is not generated on the reservations by activities in which the Tribes have a significant interest. Here, however, the Tribes are not merely importing a product onto the reservations for immediate resale to non-Indians. They have built modern facilities which provide recreational opportunities and ancillary services to their patrons, who do not simply drive onto the reservations, make purchases and depart, but spend extended periods of time there enjoying the services the Tribes provide. The Tribes have a strong incentive to provide comfortable, clean, and attractive facilities and well-run games in order to increase attendance at the games.... [T]he Cabazon and Morongo Bands are generating value on the reservations through activities in which they have a substantial interest. ", "The Court apparently distinguished bingo enterprises from smokeshops, therefore, because the tribes invested more money and effort in bingo facilities than in smokeshops, and the customers were attracted by more than just the opportunity to play bingo free from the limitations from state law.", "The state and county also argued that the Court's opinion in Rice v. Rehner supported application of their laws to tribal gaming. In Rice the Court held that California could require a federally licensed Indian trader who was a tribal member and operated a general store on a reservation to obtain a state liquor license for sales for off-premises consumption. The Court distinguished Rice based on the difference in federal policies concerning tribal and state authority over liquor and federal policies concerning tribal and state authority over gaming on Indian reservations:", "[O]ur decision [in Rice ] rested on the grounds that Congress had never recognized any sovereign tribal interest in regulating liquor traffic and that Congress, historically, had plainly anticipated that the States would exercise concurrent authority to regulate the use and distribution of liquor on Indian reservations. There is no such traditional federal view governing the outcome of this case, since, as we have explained, the current federal policy is to promote precisely what California seeks to prevent.", "Essentially, therefore, Rice did not apply to Indian gaming because federal policy, as determined by the executive branch, promoted Indian gaming that was free from state regulation.", "California also asserted that its interest in preventing organized crime from infiltrating tribal bingo outweighed the federal and tribal interests and justified imposing its laws on tribal gaming. While acknowledging that the state had a legitimate interest, the Court found it was insufficient \"to escape the pre-emptive force of federal and tribal interests apparent in this case\" because there was no proof that organized crime had infiltrated the tribes' gaming and because federal policy, as determined by the executive branch, favored tribal gaming.", "The Court concluded \"that the State's interest in preventing the infiltration of the tribal bingo enterprises by organized crime does not justify state regulation of the tribal bingo enterprises in light of the compelling federal and tribal interests supporting them. State regulation would impermissibly infringe on tribal government.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Dissent", "paragraphs": ["Three Justices dissented from the majority opinion. The primary argument of the dissent was that action by the executive branch is not enough to exempt Indian gaming from state law\u2014Congress must act to exempt Indian gaming.", "The dissent also disagreed with the majority's analysis of Public Law 280. The dissenters believed the plain language of Public Law 280 authorized California to apply its gaming laws to the tribes' bingo operations: \"Congress expressly provided that the criminal laws of the State of California 'shall have the same force and effect within such Indian country as they have elsewhere within the state.'\" ", "While acknowledging that the prohibitory/regulatory distinction drawn by the majority was consistent with precedent, the dissent stated that the Court's more recent decisions \"have made it clear, however, that commercial transactions between Indians and non-Indians\u2014even when conducted on a reservation\u2014do not enjoy any blanket immunity from state regulation.\" The majority had distinguished this case from Rice v. Rehner , in which the Court held the state could require a tribal member who was a federally licensed Indian trader selling liquor on the reservation to obtain a state liquor license for off-premises sales, on the grounds that Congress never recognized a tradition of tribal sovereignty over alcohol on Indian reservations, but it did recognize that states would have concurrent jurisdiction over alcohol on Indian reservations. The dissent rejected this explanation by quoting Rice itself: \"'If there is any interest in tribal sovereignty implicated by imposition of California's alcoholic beverage regulation, it exists only insofar as the State attempts to regulate Rehner's sale of liquor to other members of the Pala Tribe on the Pala Reservation.'\" According to the dissent, therefore, the tribe's sovereign interest was limited to sales between tribal members, implying that the state had an interest in regulating transactions between Indians and non-Indians on the reservation. ", "The dissent also rejected the majority's conclusion that tribal bingo was consistent with the state public policy because the state regulated bingo, rather than prohibited it. \"To argue that the tribal bingo games comply with the public policy of California because the State permits some other gambling is tantamount to arguing that driving over 60 miles an hour is consistent with public policy because the State allows driving at speeds of up to 55 miles an hour.\"", "The dissenters believed that even if Public Law 280 did not authorize the state to apply its gaming laws to the tribes' bingo operations, the state had authority to apply the gaming laws under Washington v. Confederated Tribes of the Colville Indian Reservation . In that case, the dissent noted, the Court rejected the tribe's argument that, because the revenues from the smokeshops funded essential government services, the state did not have authority to tax on-reservation cigarette sales to non-Indians. However, the majority seemed to accept that same argument here when it noted that the revenue from gaming was necessary for the tribes to realize the policy goals of self-determination and economic self-sufficiency. In addition, the dissent wrote, just as the smokeshops were marketing an exemption from state taxation, the tribal bingo operations were marketing an exemption to state law. \"[I]t is painfully obvious that the value of the Tribe's asserted exemption from California's gambling laws is the primary attraction to customers who would normally do their gambling elsewhere.\" ", "The dissent stated the state had both \"economic and protective\" interests that justified applying the gaming laws to tribal bingo. The state had determined that: ", "its interest in generating revenues for the public fisc and for certain charities outweighs the benefits from a total prohibition against publicly sponsored games of chance. Whatever revenues the Tribes receive from their unregulated bingo games drain funds from the state-approved recipients of lottery revenues\u2014just as tax-free cigarette sales in the Confederated Tribes case diminished the receipts the tax collector would otherwise have received.", "The dissent thought the majority dismissed the state's concerns about criminal activity associated with \"unregulated\" tribal bingo too readily. \"[U]nless Congress authorizes and regulates these commercial gambling ventures catering to non-Indians, the State has a legitimate law enforcement interest in proscribing them.\"", "The dissent closed with the following:", "Appellants and the Secretary of the Interior may well be correct, in the abstract, that gambling facilities are a sensible way to generate revenues that are badly needed by reservation Indians. But the decision to adopt, to reject, or to define the precise contours of such a course of action, and thereby to set aside the substantial public policy concerns of a sovereign State, should be made by the Congress of the United States. It should not be made by the Court, by the temporary occupant of the Office of the Secretary of the Interior, or by non-Indian entrepreneurs who are experts in gambling management but not necessarily dedicated to serving the future well-being of Indian tribes.", "It appears, therefore, that Indian gaming escaped regulation by the states because the majority accepted that the executive branch's policies and actions supporting tribal bingo as a means for tribes to realize greater self-determination and economic self-sufficiency could pre-empt state law. "], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "IGRA", "paragraphs": ["Although the Indian tribes won a big victory in Cabazon , their right to engage in gaming was vulnerable because if the executive branch ever decided not to encourage Indian gaming as a means to realize federal policy goals of self-determination and economic self-sufficiency, under the reasoning of Cabazon , states would be able to enforce their gaming laws against tribal gaming on tribal land. Moreover, tribal gaming operations apparently were still subject to closure under FACA and OCCA. Therefore, federal legislation was needed to secure the tribes' ability to engage in gaming free from state regulation. One of IGRA's policy goals was \"to provide a statutory basis for the operation of gaming by Indian tribes as a means of promoting tribal economic development, self-sufficiency, and strong tribal governments.\" Furthermore, Congress needed to provide for regulation of Indian gaming to satisfy state and federal entities concerned about criminal infiltration of Indian gaming. Congress had been considering Indian gaming bills for approximately four years when the Supreme Court decided Cabazon . IGRA was not so much a direct response to Cabazon , as it was the culmination of congressional efforts which were focused by the Court's decision in Cabazon . ", "As explained in the Senate report on the bill that became IGRA, Congress sought to \"preserve the right of tribes to self-government while, at the same time, to protect both the tribes and the gaming public from unscrupulous persons. An additional objective inherent in any government regulatory scheme is to achieve a fair balancing of competitive economic interests.\" The states wanted Congress to authorize state regulation of Indian gaming, to subject Indian gaming to the same rules as non-Indian gaming, and to allow state taxation of Indian gaming. The tribes opposed any state regulation and lobbied for exclusive tribal regulation. As a fallback position, tribes were prepared to accept federal, but not state, regulation. In IGRA, Congress maintained the current regulatory scheme of tribal and federal regulation of bingo and provided a framework for the regulation of Indian casino gaming which would not unilaterally impose state jurisdiction on the tribe's gaming, but would allow tribes to determine the extent to which they were willing to subject themselves to state jurisdiction through a tribal-state compact. ", "IGRA provided a statutory basis for Indian gaming on \"Indian lands\" and struck a balance between tribal, state, and federal interests in its scheme for regulating Indian gaming. It also created the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) as an independent agency to oversee and regulate Indian gaming on the federal level."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "What are \"Indian Lands?\"", "paragraphs": ["Because IGRA authorizes Indian gaming only on \"Indian lands,\" it is important to understand what land constitutes \"Indian lands.\" Section 2703(4) defines \"Indian lands\" to include any lands within a reservation and any land outside a reservation which is either held in trust or the title to which is subject to restriction \"over which an Indian tribe exercises governmental power.\" ", "For non-reservation trust or restricted fee land, therefore, the tribe must exercise \"governmental authority\" over it. A prerequisite to exercising governmental power over trust or restricted fee land is jurisdiction. A tribe cannot satisfy the requirement that it exercises governmental power over the land by taking unilateral action, such as obtaining the landowner's consent to its authority, posting the land as tribal territory, flying the tribal flag on the land, or providing periodic law enforcement on the land. Rather, the tribe must have jurisdiction over the land under federal law. ", "A tribe's jurisdiction over land depends on whether the land is \"Indian country.\" Indian country includes reservations, dependent Indian communities, and allotments held in trust or restricted fee. Only land that has been set aside for Indian use and is superintended by the federal government qualifies as Indian country. Land need not be formally declared a reservation to qualify as Indian country as a reservation; rather it is enough if it is tribal trust land. Therefore, outside of a reservation, a tribe exercises jurisdiction over land that is its own trust land or an allotment belonging to a member of the tribe.", "Having jurisdiction and exercising governmental power are not the same thing. Aside from jurisdiction, courts have looked for \"concrete manifestations\" that the tribe exercises governmental authority. In Rhode Island v. Narragansett Indian Tribe , the court accepted the tribe receiving funds to administer federal programs under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, establishing a housing authority and receiving funds for federal programs from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and receiving \"treatment as a state\" status for the purposes of federal environmental statutes as sufficient to establish that it exercised governmental power.", "\"Indian lands,\" therefore, include any land within an Indian reservation and trust or restricted fee land over which the tribe has jurisdiction under federal law and exercises governmental power.

Florida , the Supreme Court held that Congress did not have authority under the Indian Commerce Clause to waive states' sovereign immunity to lawsuits by tribes to enforce the good faith bargaining requirement. It held further that the doctrine of Ex parte Young did not authorize suits against the governor for failing to negotiate in good faith because Congress provided the exclusive mechanism to remedy a state's violation of IGRA.

The Secretary adopted regulations\u2014called Secretarial Procedures\u2014that provide an administrative process, modeled after the IGRA process, under which a tribe could conduct class III gaming when a state asserts its sovereign immunity to a lawsuit brought by the tribe to enforce the good faith requirement. Once a state asserts its sovereign immunity, a tribe may submit a proposal for class III gaming to the Secretary. The Secretary then gives the state 60 days to comment and submit its own proposal. If the state does not submit a proposal, the Secretary reviews the tribe's proposal and either approves it or offers the tribe and the state a conference to address \"unresolved issues and areas of disagreements.\" The Secretary must then make a \"final decision either setting forth the Secretary's proposed Class III gaming procedures for the Indian tribe, or disapproving the proposal.\" If the state submits a proposal, the Secretary appoints a mediator who will follow the IGRA procedures to resolve the differences between the two proposals. The Secretary may reject the mediator's proposal but he \"must prescribe appropriate procedures within 60 days under which Class III gaming may take place.\" While IGRA required a judicial finding of a state's bad faith, the Secretary's regulations apply anytime a state asserts its sovereign immunity, regardless of whether it was negotiating in good faith. Moreover, IGRA provided for a mediator selected by the court and proscribed the Secretary's discretion in prescribing class III procedures by requiring that they be consistent with the mediator's proposal.", "In Texas v. United States , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that IGRA did not authorize the Secretary to promulgate the Secretarial Procedures. In particular, the court noted that IGRA required involvement of the judiciary in finding bad faith and selecting a mediator, and circumscribed the Secretary's discretion to select procedures under which a tribe may engage in class III gaming by requiring that they be consistent with the compact the mediator selected. Because the Secretarial Procedures did not require a judicial finding of bad faith and judicial appointment of a mediator, they were found to be inconsistent with IGRA.", "IGRA practically guaranteed that tribes would be able to engage in Class III gaming even over the objections of a state by providing that tribes could sue states in federal district court. After Seminole , IGRA no longer carried that guarantee. The Secretarial Procedures were designed to replace IGRA's procedures to allow tribes to conduct class III gaming when a state refuses to waive its sovereign immunity. Texas v. United States invalidated the Secretarial Procedures for the states of Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, the states located within the Fifth Circuit.

Although IGRA explicitly prohibits states from imposing a tax or a fee on Indian gaming, the Secretary and the courts have allowed revenue sharing provided the tribes get something to which they are not otherwise entitled, usually exclusivity for Indian gaming, in return. However, revenue sharing percentages have increased even as states have not been able to offer greater exclusivity. Such revenue sharing appears to violate IGRA's prohibition on state taxation of Indian gaming. In Rincon Band of Luiseno Mission Indians of the Rincon Reservation v. Schwarzenegger , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that in negotiating an amendment to the tribe's compact, California's demand for a substantial percentage of the gaming revenues which would be paid to the state's general fund, was made in bad faith, in part, because the state was not offering any greater exclusivity than the tribe had under its existing compact.

If the tribe does not have a reservation, the land is located within 25 miles of where a substantial number of members live; from October 17, 1988, the tribe has demonstrated a routine presence on the land; the land was within the first-submitted request for land since acknowledgment or restoration or the application to take land into trust was within five years of acknowledgment or restoration; and the tribe is not gaming on other land.", "In determining that the tribe has an aboriginal connection to the land, the Secretary would have to consider the following:", "The tribe's historical presence on the land; Whether the membership can demonstrate lineal descent or cultural affiliation with the land; The area in which the tribe's language was spoke; The proximity of tribal sacred sites; Forcible removal from the land; and Other factors that demonstrate the tribe's presence prior to its fist interactions with non-natives, the federal government, or another sovereign.", "S. 2676 , introduced in the 110 th Congress, would have amended IGRA in several ways. First, it would have struck all the exceptions to the prohibition on gaming on newly acquired lands, except for the two part determination. Second, it would have amended the two part determination to require that the Secretary consult with tribal, state, and local jurisdictions within 60 miles of the trust land and require that the Secretary consider the \"results of a study of the economic impact of the gaming establishment\" in determining that the gaming operation would not have a negative impact on any tribal, state, or local jurisdiction located within 60 miles. The proposed bill would also require the concurrence of the state legislature, as well as the governor, for the two part determination. In addition, it would have required that the tribe satisfy certain criteria to demonstrate that it has a \"geographic, social, and historical nexus\" to the land. The proposed bill would have amended IGRA's authorization of class II gaming by restricting class II gaming to lands that were Indian lands on the date of enactment or land acquired afterwards provided the tribe indicated it would engage in class II gaming on the land when it filed its application for taking the land into trust. It also would restrict a tribe's ability to change the use of non-gaming trust land to use it for gaming. S. 2676 would also have amended the authority of the chairman of NIGC to authorize background checks of the ten persons or entities with the greatest financial interest in any of the gaming enterprises regulated by the NIGC and any other person the NIGC deems appropriate.

Because of the executive branch's support of Indian gaming as a legitimate source of tribal revenues, in Cabazon , the Supreme Court found that federal and tribal interests supporting tribal gaming outweighed state interests in regulating Indian gaming. Congress passed IGRA after Cabazon to provide a statutory basis for tribal gaming, to establish a system for regulating Indian gaming, and to establish the NIGC. ", "IGRA divides Indian gaming into three classes. Class I gaming includes traditional or social gaming and is regulated exclusively by the tribes. Congress affirmed Cabazon as to bingo, or class II gaming, by providing that it is subject to tribal regulation with federal oversight by the NIGC. However, Congress recognized that states had greater interests in casino-style, or class III, gaming and, therefore, gave states a role in regulating class III gaming through the tribal-state compact. In order to engage in class III gaming, a tribe must have a gaming compact that allows them to do so, or have procedures issued by the Secretary after a good faith lawsuit. ", "The NIGC plays an important role in regulating tribal gaming by approving tribal gaming ordinances, approving management contracts, imposing fines and closing gaming operations for violations of IGRA, NIGC regulations, or tribal ordinances, and monitoring class II operations. NIGC also makes determinations about whether land qualifies as \"Indian land.\"", "IGRA created an incentive for states to negotiate gaming compacts by providing that tribes could take states that did not negotiate in good faith to federal court. If, after a finding by the court of bad faith on the part of the state, the state and the tribe could not agree to a compact, IGRA provided a mechanism by which a tribe could engage in class III gaming without a state's agreement. However, in Seminole , the Supreme Court held that Congress did not have authority to waive the states' sovereign immunity to the tribes' lawsuits. Although IGRA bars states from imposing a tax or fee on Indian gaming and limits the issues subject to negotiation between tribes and states to those that are gaming related, states have been negotiating for a share of tribal gaming revenues and bringing non-gaming issues into compact negotiations. Because, after Seminole , tribes cannot resort to the courts to enforce IGRA's limitations, they have tended to accept arguably prohibited conditions in their compacts.", "Congress has been most interested in off-reservation gaming on newly acquired lands. In the past five years, several bills have been introduced which would amend IGRA to limit the ability of tribes to game on newly acquired lands. "], "subsections": []}]}}
