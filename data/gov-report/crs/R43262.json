On September 18, 2013, the agency released proposals to implement the pay ratio provision. A firm will be able to choose its own methodology to calculate worker median pay, including statistical sampling.", "Supporters of the provision, including its sponsor Senator Robert Menendez, argue that the public company data on CEO-worker pay disparity that will result from the provision will pressure corporate boards to be more restrained in pay packages to CEOs. The strategy can be seen as a measure to address what some describe as a board/CEO dynamic that can result in perceived excessive compensation for CEOs: board members may feel beholden to the CEO, who may also serve as board chair. Research consistent with this notion of insufficiently independent boards exists. Other research, however, appears to be consistent with the view that public company CEOs operate in a generally competitive marketplace in which the value that they give to shareholders is fairly compensated.", "Other supporters of the pay ratio provision, including consumer groups, labor groups, and pension funds, also claim that disclosures that will result from the provision will help to inform investor decision making, including on whether a CEO's compensation is reasonable given a firm's overall worker compensation picture. If a corporate disclosure adds value to the investing process, it is said to provide material information. Materiality is central to the SEC's adoption of disclosure regulations, including the compensation disclosure rules that it has issued over the years. The SEC has observed that the usefulness to investors of the company-specific pay ratio data in the pay ratio provision cannot be quantified.", "Critics of the pay ratio provision, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, human resources groups, and other business-related groups, counter that the value of corporate disclosure data is linked to the ability of investors to use it to compare various firms. A principal concern is that this comparative value of the ratios will be undermined. An additional concern is that the provision will mislead investors who try to compare the CEO-worker pay ratios from domestic firms in industries with differing levels of worker pay and from domestic firms without a global workforce relative to domestic firms with global workers who are paid at varying wage levels in different currencies.", "There is also some concern that the pay ratio provision is likely to result in substantial compliance challenges and costs, especially for large multinational or multi-segmented firms with decentralized payroll systems. Some estimates are that implementation costs for some companies could be in the millions of dollars. The SEC acknowledged that such firms would be likely to face greater compliance challenges and costs. In the aggregate, the proposal estimated that firms would spend about $72 million over a three-year period to comply with the pay ratio provision with large, multinational firms likely facing the greatest costs.", "H.R. 1135 (Huizenga) would repeal the pay ratio provision, Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act.

The pay ratio provision has been the subject of considerable interest and discussion in Congress and elsewhere. Driven by concerns that the corporate costs of arriving at the disclosures would exceed their benefits, legislation was introduced in the 113 th Congress to repeal the provision. On September 18, 2013, the SEC proposed rules to implement the pay ratio provision. To address concerns over the challenges of calculating worker median pay, the SEC has proposed giving firms the flexibility to \"select a [calculation] methodology,\" which could include the use of a statistical sample of the total worker population.

In principle, board members bargain for the CEO's services on behalf of company shareholders.", "Moody's, a major credit rating agency, identified several reasons why the award of proper levels of compensation to corporate executives like the CEOs matters:", "[I]ncentives for the key leaders help to shape company policies and performance pressures. Managers of corporations have broad powers and a wide range of discretion. Boards typically offer managers substantial and elaborate financial incentives (particularly in the United States) in significant measure to encourage certain priorities and types of behavior. Second, effective compensation policies are important for executive recruitment and retention.... Excessive pay raises governance issues, but investor interests also can be harmed by executive remuneration policies that fail to attract and retain effective leadership. Third, where disclosure on executive compensation is reasonably good (as in the United States, Canada and certain other markets), pay practice can provide some visibility into the relationship between the board of directors and senior management, and on whether management is in fact accountable to the board. Unusually high pay can signal a weak board, particularly if pay levels have limited relationship to performance. A 2005 Moody's study \u2026 found an empirical relationship between (1) outliers that pay very high levels of bonus and stock option pay in comparison with peers and (2) subsequent realized credit risk. While the study did not demonstrate causation, we believe that a likely factor in this linkage is the degree to which unusually high executive pay can reflect weak board oversight.", "Debate on aligning executive pay with various metrics of corporate financial performance, called \"pay for performance,\" became prominent in the 1980s. A feature of the pay for performance approach was the provision of stock options as a major component of executive pay. ", "Whether public company CEO compensation levels have become excessive, bearing little relationship to the goals of pay for performance, has regularly been a subject of public discourse. Describing this debate, one report observed, ", "The question of whether CEOs of America's major companies are overpaid has been a perennial subject of interest for many years. Are the compensation practices for these elite men and women fair and appropriate? Do these compensation practices provide proper incentives? Or do they reward excessive caution or risk taking?

The data include average annual CEO total pay in five-year increments between 1991 and 2010 and then single-year annual pay data for 2011 and 2012 based on Forbes ' calculations. As shown in Figure 1 , Forbes finds that the average CEO compensation of $3.57 million during 1991-1995 grew by more than threefold to $12.9 million by 2006-2010, the peak pay period. The average pay then fell by about $3.5 million dollars to $9.4 million in 2011, then rose by about one-tenth to $10.5 million in 2012. ", "A widely embraced view on corporate board and CEO dynamics is that several factors distort the market for public company CEOs. Some have observed that board directors are formally elected by shareholders, but are often nominated by top management. Under these circumstances, it is rare for management's slate of directors to be voted down. Once a director becomes a member of a board, he or she may be reluctant to bargain hard with top executives over the executive's pay because cordial relationships between the executives and board members are generally believed to be important for fostering functional boards. In this narrative, rather than haggle over top management pay, boards hire compensation consultants, who recommend a \"best practices\" approach, which generally involves matching what the most successful companies in the industry pay their (the peer group) heads. Other factors that may help to reinforce a \"cozy\" CEO/board dynamic are when CEOs also serve as the board chair and when many directors are themselves active or retired CEOs. Adherents of this view, often called the managerial power thesis , describe an inefficient market for public company CEOs. ", "Evidence consistent with a CEO market in which there is some board ''capture\" by top management comes from research by Larcker, Richardson, Tuna, and Seary. The research examined possible connections between CEO pay and a CEO's \"back door\" links with members of the company's board, defined as shared board memberships in other companies. Among other things, the research found that CEOs with any back door link to someone on the company's board compensation committee (which oversees compensation issues) received $453,688 on average more than CEOs without such links.", "Another observation that appears to be consistent with the notion of a market for CEOs that does not conform with pay for performance comes from the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank: \"[f]rom 1978 to 2012, CEO compensation measured with [stock] options realized increased about 875%, a rise more than double stock market growth.\"", "An opposing view is held by the so-called neoclassical school. Proponents say that various metrics indicate that the market for CEOs is generally competitive and efficient and has resulted in levels of executive pay that tend to reflect performance.

Mr. Kaplan also noted that ", "CEO pay levels relative to other highly paid groups today are comparable to their average levels in the early 1990s. In fact, the relative pay of large company CEOs is similar to its average level since the 1930s. The ratio of large company CEO pay to firm market value also has remained roughly constant since 1960.

In the 1980s, Mr. Drucker argued that companies should try to adhere to a CEO-to-average worker pay ratio of 25:1, which he later changed to 20:1.

Generally for smaller firms with less than 3,250 employees who are well informed about worker CEO pay differentials and work in an environment in which promotion is largely merit-based, the CEO-employee pay ratio was found to be significantly and positively related to gains in firm productivity. Generally, firm stock valuation and firm operating performance increased as CEO-employee pay ratios increased.

For example, some have warned against comparing such disclosures across firms from different industries, which can have substantially different CEO-worker pay ratios because companies in different sectors may have different labor and management mixes and wage levels. ", "It has also been argued that comparing pay ratio data for firms across companies of different sizes is likely to have little value because companies with higher annual sales tend to pay their CEOs more. A related argument has been made that comparisons of pay ratios of domestic companies with no overseas workers with those with a global worker presence could also be problematic. This is because global firms could have overseas workers who reside in different countries with different average wage rates, different costs of living, different tax regimes, and different levels of government-provided benefits. ", "For example, some claim that meaningless inconsistencies would follow from a comparison of the pay ratios of a company that has outsourced jobs (for example, call centers) to locales with lower worker pay levels to those of otherwise similar firms who have remained entirely stateside. Such inconsistencies, it is argued, could be further exacerbated by currency exchange rate fluctuations. ", "Proponents of the pay ratio provision counter that such shortcomings can be reasonably addressed. To make the pay ratio disclosures more compatible, they suggest that pay ratio data based on a company's full-time domestic employees and its non-domestic workers could be disclosed separately. They also argue that pay ratio disclosure data could be made more meaningful if companies were encouraged to append a detailed narrative discussion on composition of the ratios to their disclosures. ", "On the comparability problems posed by differences in compensation levels across various industries, supporters of the pay ratio provision also could arguably make the same \"apples to oranges\" criticisms against the various corporate financial ratios that are widely used by analysts and investors. The SEC, however, does not require the disclosure of financial ratios. They are calculated by outsiders who use the data from the mandatory corporate financial disclosures that are required by the SEC.", "Expressing doubts about the benefits some ascribe to the pay ratio provision, SEC staff commentary in the SEC's pay provision proposal noted that company-specific information about median employee pay would be new investor information that resulted from the pay ratio provision. However, the staff also observed that various pay ratio advocates", "have not specified whether this type of company-specific information would be equally useful in connection with all types of companies or whether the potential benefits are more relevant to certain types of businesses, industries, business structure or size of registrant [the company] and \u2026 have not specified what an optimal pay ratio is or what a proper benchmark should be. They also have not specified what effect a pay ratio has on employee morale and productivity relative to other environment-specific and company-specific factors. To the extent that factors exist that could cause the ratios to differ, precise comparability across companies may not be relevant and could generate potentially misleading interpretations or conclusions.", "Critics of the pay provision can also cite a body of work on how numerous and sometimes complex mandatory corporate disclosure requirements can potentially overwhelm some investors and erode the overall value of a firm's disclosures to investors.", "The provision's detractors have also argued that the number of annual public corporate shareholder proposals for disclosing CEO and worker pay ratios has been limited over the years. For example, in 2010, there were reportedly nine such shareholder proposals with an average level of support from all shareholders of 6.4%. Others would, however, argue that shareholder proposals are merely precatory, meaning that they are just advisory and corporate boards are not required to comply with them. Thus, such figures may underrepresent the level of actual shareholder interest in CEO/worker pay ratio disclosure.", "Critics of the pay ratio provision can also point to the fact that although the SEC has proposed and adopted several executive pay-related mandatory disclosures since 1938, the agency has done so under the rubric of its mission of ensuring that investors have access to material information. In this context, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) was not able to find any SEC proposed or adopted executive pay-related proposals in the area of mandatory disclosures of CEO and worker pay ratios. Various proponents of the pay provision, such as Senator Robert Menendez (its original sponsor), say that the provision was in part a response to perceived excessive CEO pay levels. As such, they can cite research findings that similar congressional concerns were behind executive pay disclosure requirements in the first federal securities law, the Securities Act of 1933. They can also cite other congressionally passed executive pay-related legislation, which appears to have also been motivated by perceptions of excessive executive pay."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Costs of Complying with the Pay Provision", "paragraphs": ["Complying with the pay ratio provision will impose some costs on public companies. A concern is that the cost of computing the ratio may impose what some describe as \"immense\" costs, especially for large multinational or multi-segment companies. Many of these reportedly have decentralized payrolls and no centralized compensation database for all their employees. Related concerns are that the required formulation of total annual worker compensation data, which many think will be required in the pay ratio provision, will entail various components of employment income. Among these are salaries and bonuses, stock compensation, defined compensation arrangements, and pension and other post-retirement benefits. Various reports, however, say that many companies generally do not keep such information on those various compensation elements for all of their employees on an annual basis. As such, there are concerns that the complex demands of such disclosures are likely to mean that companies may have to build new and costly administrative systems to provide such data.", "It has also been reported that many large and sophisticated global companies have human resource, payroll, and benefits systems that are not centralized, which could mean that they would have to reconcile data calculations across all countries in which they have a presence and then ensure that the data are accurate to comply with the pay ratio provision. In addition, smaller firms are said to be more likely to lack the necessary personnel to perform the calculations needed for the pay ratio data and more apt to have high employee turnover, further complicating the calculations. ", "The SEC pay ratio provision proposal acknowledged that calculating median worker compensation is more challenging when a company has \"multiple business units, geographical operations, or subsidiaries [that] maintain payroll data at each business unit or subsidiary.\" While the proposal agreed that the calculation of the average compensation for the consolidated corporate entity would only require each subsidiary or business unit to provide data on the total (or average) compensation and the number of its employees to the corporate parent, identification of the \"median requires transferring the entire set of compensation data from each subsidiary to the parent entity.\"", "Similar observations on the challenges of calculating median worker pay were raised in 2011 when Meredith Cross, then-director of the SEC's Corporation Finance Division, testified that calculating the pay ratio could be \"complex\"\u2014especially calculations involving a median as opposed to an average.", "The Center on Executive Compensation is a research and advocacy adjunct of the HR Policy Association, a public policy organization of chief human resource officers from some of the nation's largest corporations. The group has been active in lobbying for the repeal of the pay ratio provision and has surveyed member companies on the potential implications of implementing the provision.", "About three-quarters of the survey's respondents had more than 10,000 employees worldwide and a little over one-third had more than 50,000 employees worldwide. In addition, three-quarters of the respondents reported having employees in more than 10 countries with many larger companies having employees in at least 30 countries. ", "According to the survey's findings, almost half of the respondents reported that it would take their companies a minimum of three months to calculate median employee compensation. Nearly one-quarter reportedly indicated that the calculations were likely to take at least five months. Based on the survey, the center said that for many companies, implementation costs for the pay provisions are likely to be in the millions of dollars.", "Countering such views, pay ratio provision supporters cite the presence of a number of domestic companies without a global presence that disclose executive pay data along with average or median employee pay figures in their proxy filings to the SEC. Among them are the financial services firms MBIA and the Bank of South Carolina. In addition, Whole Foods, the retail grocer, maintains records of each employee's salary and bonus to ensure that no one earns more than 19 times the company's average pay. The pay cap at Whole Foods reportedly does not include stock options or pension benefits, the reporting of which is generally believed to be required under the pay ratio provision. ", "SEC staff commentary in the agency's proposed rule for implementing the pay ratio provision noted that allowing firms to choose their own method for calculating median worker pay will enable them to conduct the required pay ratio disclosures in a \"relatively cost-efficient\" way.", "Overall, the SEC estimated that the aggregate corporate compliance costs associated with implementing the pay ratio provision over a three-year period would be about 545,792 hours of company personnel time and about $72,772,200 for the services of outside professionals. The estimates included both the time and the cost of \"data gathering systems and disclosure controls and procedures, compiling necessary data, preparing and reviewing disclosure, filing documents and retaining records.\"", "The SEC proposal also noted that because it would provide for some flexibility in identifying the worker median pay, the corporate compliance burden could be lower if the methodology employed reduced the efforts required to collect the data. According to the SEC, the actual compliance burden would likely vary based on factors such as company size, the number of employees, and the number of workers located outside of the United States. For a company with a medium-sized workforce that is primarily domestically located, the proposal said that identifying a median employee from a sample of its employee population in which a consistently applied compensation measure was used would require a three-year average of 95 additional hours of work annually (based on 170 hours in year one, 80 hours in year two, and 35 hours in year three and thereafter). In contrast, it noted that for a large, multi-national firm employing hundreds of thousands of employees, the hours needed to comply with the pay ratio provision would probably be higher. ", "After the proposal's release, some in the business community, such as the law firm Sidley Austin, said that the SEC proposal's flexibility could help produce some cost savings that would \"be welcome to many U.S. public companies.\" But overall, the law firm echoed concerns expressed by other business-related entities, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, when it warned that \"compliance with the new [proposed] rules still has the potential to be burdensome, particularly for large and/or multinational companies.\"", "Another potential consequence of having to comply with the pay ratio provision is that companies might be incentivized to present a more favorable CEO-to-worker pay ratio through workforce-based business restructuring. This could include substituting lower paid foreign-based corporate employees for domestic corporate employees, and shifting from company-employed workers to outsourced employees. ", "In its proposal, the SEC staff commented on such unintended business structural consequences: \"[T]he potential value of this disclosure for assessing issues related to employee morale, productivity and investment in human capital may be diminished by the indirect costs of creating incentives for registrants to change their business structure.\" "], "subsections": []}]}]}}
