Proponents of increased energy efficiency see an untapped \"resource\" that can mitigate the demand for additional energy supplies. Perceived benefits of energy efficiency include lowered energy bills, reduced demand for energy, improved energy security and independence, and reduced air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Challenges to energy efficiency include market barriers that do not incentivize builders or developers to invest in energy efficiency, customers' lack of information or awareness of energy saving opportunities and investment returns, and policy barriers that focus on energy supply rather than investment in energy efficiency.", "S. 385\u2014the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act\u2014and its House companion bill, H.R. 1443, address energy efficiency in buildings, industry, and federal agencies, and various regulatory measures. Energy savings through increased efficiency can be significant. Estimates by the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Academies of achievable energy savings using available cost-effective technologies are about 20% for the buildings sector and range from 14% to 22% for the industrial sector. Combined, these sectors consume 72% of all U.S. primary energy. Further savings can be realized through efforts to improve energy efficiency across the federal government, which is the single largest energy consumer in the United States.", "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that S. 385 would increase direct federal spending by $17 million between 2017 and 2027. Enacting the bill would not affect revenues. CBO estimated that implementing the legislation would cost the government $198 million over the next five years, assuming appropriations actions that fulfill all provisions of the legislation.", "Supporters of S. 385/H.R. 1443 state that the bills can improve competitiveness, save consumers money, and increase energy security while reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the building and industrial sectors collectively consume 72% of all U.S. primary energy. The residential and commercial buildings sector accounts for 40% of all U.S. primary energy consumption, and the industrial sector accounts for 32%. Increased adoption of energy-efficiency technologies by these sectors could potentially realize significant energy savings and reduce emissions to the environment. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that building energy use could be reduced by more than 20% through implementation of technologies that are known to be cost-effective. Implementation of existing, cost-effective efficiency technologies in the industrial sector could reduce energy consumption by 14%-22% according to the National Academies. Challenges to energy efficiency include market forces that do not incentivize investment in energy efficiency, a lack of information or awareness of energy saving opportunities and investment returns, and policy approaches that reward selling energy and discourage investment in energy efficiency.

Cost estimates from CBO are limited to federal outlays and revenues that would change if the legislation were enacted and fully implemented, and do not extend to the microeconomic costs and benefits that would be incurred by industry or consumers. According to CBO, S. 385 would increase direct spending by $17 million for 2017-2027 and cost $198 million over five years to implement, assuming that appropriations would be consistent with the authorizing legislation. Increases in direct spending would arise from provisions that direct federal agencies that guarantee mortgages to take into account energy-efficiency improvements when evaluating a borrower's ability to repay a mortgage. CBO expects that the requirement, if enacted, would increase the total volume of mortgages insured by federal entities by less than 0.1%. ", "As the requirements for the proposed federal energy-efficiency goals are largely consistent with existing statute and administrative policy, CBO does not anticipate them to significantly add to federal spending. Additionally, federal agency spending on renewable energy certificates (RECs) would decrease, as current requirements to reduce the consumption of energy generated from fossil fuels would be modified. These findings are consistent with the analysis done by CBO for S. 720 (114 th Congress).", "S. 385 would impose an intergovernmental mandate by requiring states and tribal governments to certify to the DOE whether or not they have updated residential and commercial building codes to meet the latest building energy-efficiency standards. CBO estimated the cost of this intergovernmental mandate, as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA). CBO determined that the cost of the mandate would be well below the threshold established in UMRA for 2017. Additionally, S. 385 would authorize funding and technical assistance to state, local, and tribal governments to implement the certification requirement.

ACEEE found that the majority of potential energy savings in the bill could be realized through implementation of building energy codes. The provisions in S. 1392 responsible for the largest energy savings, according to ACEEE, are identical (with a minor conforming change for authorization of appropriations) with the provisions in S. 385 / H.R. 1443 . However, comparing the results for energy or cost savings estimates by ACEEE from S. 1392 would overestimate the benefits of the current bills within a 2020 or 2030 time frame, as the ACEEE analysis quantified potential energy savings beginning in the year 2015.

Opponents to targets state that greater transparency in DOE's technical support of code development is needed to avoid concerns of an \"inappropriate advocacy role.\" Furthermore, they state that DOE's role should be to serve as \"technical advisor\" and not push for specific goals, products, or technologies. DOE has a role in certification of energy-efficiency codes. Under 42 U.S.C. 6833, states are required to certify to DOE that they have compared a new building energy code standard to their current code. For residential building energy codes, the certification includes a determination as to whether it is appropriate to revise the state's current code to meet or exceed the revised code. For commercial building energy codes, the certification confirms that the state's building code has been updated appropriately.", "Regarding cost-effectiveness, some prefer the simple payback approach limited to 10 years, as is proposed within H.R. 2361 . Proponents consider such an approach effective in communicating the payback for consumers in easily understood terms and meeting consumers' expectations for short-term returns on investment. Supporters of H.R. 2361 contend that the current model code process requires costly products and materials, which could be corrected by requiring a shorter payback period. Opponents of a simple payback limited to 10 years state that the approach neglects benefits that occur after the period, ignores the benefits beyond the initial investor, does not account for mortgage financing, and thus does not accurately measure the full benefits and overall profitability.", "The lifetimes of major building components generally exceed a 10-year time frame and often exceed the time span of 15-year and 30-year mortgages. The average residential building lifetime in the United States is 61 years, and typical building component (e.g., insulation, windows, roof) lifetimes exceed 10 years. For example, the warranty period for windows is often 20 to 25 years depending upon the type and can last throughout the building lifetime with maintenance. Products with shorter lifetimes such as water heaters or refrigeration equipment are not typically included when determining building energy code cost-effectiveness, as they have separate energy-efficiency standards.
