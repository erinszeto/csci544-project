The increased spending between the two years was largely due to the recession, with almost two-thirds coming from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, P.L. 111-5), the economic stimulus enacted in February 2009.", "Low-income programs discussed in this report are distinct from social insurance programs, such as Social Security or Medicare, which aim to protect American workers universally against lost wages or benefits when they retire, become disabled, or lose a job. In contrast, programs addressed here focus explicitly on low-income populations. They provide assistance in obtaining basic needs, such as health care, food, or housing, and seek to address the causes of low income through education, training, or other services. While these programs are very diverse, the analysis in this report yields certain general findings:", "\u2022 Health care dominates all other categories of benefits and services, accounting for nearly half of federal spending for low-income people. Cash aid is second but trails far behind, comprising 18% of spending in FY2009. Other categories, in decreasing size, are food assistance, housing and development, education, social services, energy assistance, and employment and training.", "\u2022 Four programs account for 60% of federal spending for low-income people and 10 programs make up more than three-fourths. Medicaid alone accounted for nearly 40% of FY2009 low-income spending; next were the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly food stamps), Supplemental Security Income, and the refundable portion of the Earned Income Tax Credit.", "\u2022 Elderly and disabled individuals, and families with children are key target populations for much of the spending for low-income people. Federal policy toward families with children generally encourages work and includes incentives to \"make work pay.\" Other populations served by selected programs include veterans, students, homeless people, Indians, and refugees.", "\u2022 Within broad target populations, programs use different concepts to determine who is eligible. Most spending is on behalf of people determined individually eligible by virtue of their low income or eligibility for another income-tested program. \"Low income\" is defined in a multitude of ways, using different percentages of the federal poverty guidelines, specific dollar amounts, percentages of local area median income (primarily for housing programs), or other measures.", "\u2022 Many programs distribute funding to states or other entities to provide benefits and services to low-income people, using population-based allocation factors, cost-sharing formulas, or other mechanisms to target resources toward areas or entities with the greatest need. Some of these programs (especially in elementary and secondary education) have no further requirements for individuals to be determined income-eligible.", "\u2022 Programs for low-income people are most likely to use formula grants to distribute funds to states or another unit of government. Under many of these programs, notably including Medicaid, states must spend a specified amount of their own funds to receive federal dollars. State and local governments administer most of these federal programs; however, many of the largest programs provide federal benefits directly to individuals or via a nongovernmental intermediary."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["People and communities with limited resources are a major focus of public policy. While policymakers might disagree in theory on whether or to what extent government should act to protect the economic well-being of individuals and families, the federal government in fact spends large sums of money on numerous programs targeted toward those with limited income and assets. This report attempts to identify and analyze these programs and provide a broad overview of the policies underlying them.", "In FY2009, federal spending on programs for people with low income was almost $708 billion, and totaled nearly $578 billion the previous year. Most of the growth between the two years was related to the recession and associated policy responses, with almost two-thirds (64%) of the increase coming from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ). In both years, four programs accounted for almost 60% of total spending, and 10 programs accounted for more than 75%. ", "The distinguishing feature of federal programs examined here is their explicit focus on low-income populations, as distinct from social insurance programs such as Social Security, Medicare, or Unemployment Insurance. Social insurance programs aim to protect American workers universally against lost wages and work-related benefits due to retirement, disability, or temporary periods of unemployment. They are financed in large part through contributions from workers and employers and their aggregate spending is much larger than programs intended specifically for those with low income. Social insurance programs play a major role in reducing poverty among significant segments of the population. ", "In contrast to social insurance, programs examined in this report are funded through general revenues and provide benefits and services to people with limited income either by explicitly tying eligibility to a measure of income, or by targeting assistance through funding allocation formulas or other need-related mechanisms. They attempt to ameliorate or mitigate the effects of low income by providing cash or noncash benefits to help people meet basic needs, such as food, housing, and health care. They also seek to address root causes of economic disadvantage by providing education, training, and other services to improve people's employability and earnings capacity. Some programs combine these purposes by conditioning aid on participation in work or training or providing incentives to engage in these activities. Finally, some programs target assistance to communities with significant concentrations of low-income people to compensate for their low tax capacities, and help provide revenues to support benefits and services to residents. ", "These programs are extremely diverse in their purpose, design, and target populations. Many were created independently of one another, at different times and in response to different perceived policy problems. They also changed over time in response to various societal and other factors. \"Social welfare,\" \"social safety net,\" and \"public welfare\" are generic terms sometimes used to refer to these programs; however, there is no single label that best describes all programs included in this report.", "Key findings of the report are presented in the Summary, above. The body of the report is organized as follows:", "The report begins with a very brief history of federal low-income policy, to provide context for the subsequent discussion of current programs. The report then gives an overview of current federal spending on benefits and services for low-income people, including a review of the budgetary classification of these funds (mandatory or discretionary). The next section looks specifically at the 10 largest programs, which together account for three-fourths of all spending in the report, followed by an overview of all programs, organized by major category in order of FY2009 spending: health care, cash aid, food assistance, housing and development, education, social services, energy assistance, and employment and training. The next two sections look in greater detail at the ways in which benefits and services are directed toward people with limited income, either by establishing explicit eligibility criteria for individuals or families, or by targeting assistance toward communities or entities based on a measure of need. These sections look at use of the federal poverty guidelines and other income measures in defining eligibility or otherwise targeting assistance, as well as criteria that enable certain categories of people to qualify automatically. The form of federal assistance\u2014formula grants, competitive or discretionary awards, direct payments to individuals\u2014is the focus of the next section, which also looks at the immediate recipients of federal funds, such as states, local governments, and nonprofit organizations. The section discusses matching or other requirements for nonfederal spending, and very briefly addresses the participation of Indian tribes and U.S. territories. The report generally does not discuss the value of benefits or services provided; however, the next section shows maximum benefit levels under selected cash and near-cash benefit programs. The report concludes by identifying potential questions for further analysis. The report includes several appendixes: Appendix A discusses the methodologies used to prepare the analysis; Appendix B provides overview tables of programs included in the report; and Appendix C is a series of short fact sheets on each program. Appendix D gives references to information about the federal poverty guidelines and other income measures and eligibility tests. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Caveats", "paragraphs": ["The analysis in this report required numerous decisions about which programs to include, how to categorize them, and what measure of federal spending to use. The methodologies chosen are described in Appendix A . Readers should be aware, however, of the following caveats: The report refers to the target population of these benefits and services as persons with \"low\" or \"limited\" income, rather than \"poor\" people. Although some programs limit participation to individuals with income below federal poverty guidelines, income eligibility criteria vary widely and frequently include people with income above the federal definition of poverty. The number of programs included in this report is not meaningful. While fact sheets are presented for 82 \"programs,\" some could have been characterized as more than one program and others could have been consolidated. In addition, only programs with new obligations of $100 million or more in a given year are included. If smaller programs were included, the overall number of programs would be larger, but the analysis would essentially be unchanged. The assignment of programs\u2014and therefore dollars\u2014to broad categories (health care, cash aid, food assistance, etc.) is not perfect. Certain programs provide multiple types of assistance and spending could not be disaggregated, so spending was assigned to a single category. Some programs are ambiguous; different analysts might categorize them differently. The analysis might be changed somewhat if different assignments had been made. The report does not include tax programs, with the exception of direct spending for the refundable portion of the Earned Income Tax Credit and the refundable Additional Child Tax Credit. The report does not provide long-term trend data on spending. For reasons explained in Appendix A , obligations are generally used as the measure of spending. While obligations are the most consistent program-specific measure available for the majority of programs included here, they are difficult to trace backward. Spending is provided for FY2009 because it is the most recent year for which final amounts are available for all programs included. Because FY2009 was an unusual year, however, with a large infusion of funding from the economic stimulus law (ARRA), FY2008 spending is also shown. The report provides a snapshot of policies and spending for low-income programs in FY2008 and FY2009. It does not address the effectiveness of these programs in meeting their policy goals. Readers familiar with the CRS series of reports entitled Cash and Noncash Benefits for Persons with Limited Income should know that this report is not an update of that earlier series. This report is meant to replace that series but it uses different methodologies and is therefore not comparable to the Cash and Noncash reports. See Appendix A for an explanation of the differences."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "A Brief History of Federal Low-Income Policy", "paragraphs": ["A review of the evolution of federal policy for low-income people provides useful context for understanding today's programs and policies. The following is a quick overview of key milestones, such as the New Deal of the 1930s and the Great Society of the 1960s. While many current programs trace their roots to these eras, few exist today in the same form. Today's programs reflect policy changes enacted over many decades in response to numerous factors, particularly the shift in societal expectations about mothers working outside the home. Federal aid initially focused on groups who were not expected to work, including mothers of dependent children; however, federal policy today generally favors work among able-bodied aid recipients and includes incentives to \"make work pay.\" Federal policy also expanded over time to include efforts to address root causes of poverty and disadvantage, in addition to helping people meet their basic needs.", "Federal involvement in providing benefits and services for people with low income generally began in the first part of the 20 th century, largely after the Great Depression overwhelmed the resources of states, local governments, and private organizations, which previously had borne primary responsibility for helping the disadvantaged. With some key exceptions, such as veterans' benefits and tax credits for low-wage workers, state and local governments still play a significant role in most programs intended for low-income populations, regardless of whether they are partially or fully federally funded. ", "Benefits for veterans, initially to meet the medical needs of those who became disabled during service, are among the oldest in the United States, and date back in some form to the beginning of the country. By the early 1900s, these benefits had grown to include medical care and cash assistance for the indigent as well as veterans with disabilities, including assistance for dependents and survivors of veterans. These were the primary benefit programs administered by the federal government until the Great Depression of the 1930s.", "The New Deal was the federal government's response to the Depression, and the Social Security Act of 1935 was its cornerstone. The act brought the federal government into the fields of social insurance and cash relief for populations who either could not work or who society at that time did not expect to work. The original act established income security programs for aged and retired workers and for temporarily unemployed workers (the beginning of today's Social Security and Unemployment Compensation programs). It also authorized federal grants to states to make cash aid payments to two groups, in addition to the elderly, who were not expected to work. These groups were fatherless (dependent) children and the blind, although within these categories, the act gave states the authority to define specific eligibility and benefit levels. ", "Aid to Dependent Children, as created in 1935, was amended over the succeeding decades and became Aid to Families with Dependent Children in 1962. Aid was provided to parents (typically single mothers) in addition to the children. However, at the same time, expectations about mothers' work began to change. Starting in the late 1960s and continuing over the next 30 years, Congress imposed work registration and work or training requirements on certain parents receiving cash benefits. In 1996, Congress replaced AFDC with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), which established time limits on the receipt of benefits and conditioned cash aid on participation in work activities. States continue to make key decisions regarding eligibility and benefit levels under TANF, and have the added flexibility to use funds for noncash services. (In fact, the majority of TANF funds are now used for noncash services, such as social services and employment-related activities.) The 1996 law also gave states more federal funding for child care for low-income working families.", "The 1930s also marked the federal government's entry into the field of housing. In response to trouble in the mortgage market resulting from the Depression, the U.S. Housing Act of 1934 encouraged lending for housing construction through a new Federal Housing Administration. The U.S. Housing Act of 1937 subsequently created the low-rent Public Housing program, which required states to establish quasi-governmental local public housing authorities (PHAs) to administer the program. In 1949, Congress declared the federal goal of \"a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family,\" and over the next two decades it enacted provisions to provide affordable housing through incentives to private developers to build low-cost housing. The Housing Act of 1974 created a new rental assistance program, known as Section 8, which provided rental subsidies for private properties, in lieu of development subsidies. Section 8 was later expanded to include portable rental vouchers administered by PHAs. While Section 8 vouchers have effectively replaced subsidies for new development, many housing units that were subsidized under these earlier programs still provide affordable housing today. They are administered by PHAs or private properties, under contract with the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).", "An early version of food stamps existed for several years during the Depression and was revived in 1961 as a small pilot program. The program became permanent during the Great Society, through the Food Stamp Act of 1964. Originally, states set their own eligibility rules, and benefits varied regionally. This changed in 1971 when the program was effectively converted to a national income guarantee, providing an amount of food stamps to participating households sufficient to buy items equivalent to the Agriculture Department's \"economy diet.\" However, recipients had to contribute a monthly \"purchase requirement\" based on their income in order to obtain benefits. The law set nationally uniform eligibility rules and federally paid benefit levels, but states continued to administer the program. Congress enacted a number of major policy changes to the Food Stamp program over the next three decades, including removal of the purchase requirement in the late 1970s, allowing automatic eligibility for those receiving other public assistance benefits or services in 1985, and limiting access for able-bodied adults without dependents in 1996. In 2008, the Food Stamp program was renamed the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). States continue to administer SNAP and have some leeway in determining eligibility through application of the automatic eligibility rules, but benefit levels remain federally financed and nationally uniform.", "A central feature of the Great Society was the War on Poverty, and the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 was its primary legislative vehicle. That act and its subsequent amendments authorized numerous programs that sought to address the causes of economic disadvantage, and to ameliorate its effects. Programs were designed to meet the multiple needs of low-income preschool children and their families, and the employability needs of low-income youth and adults, and to give low-income people a formal role in planning services for their communities. Modern-day programs with origins in the War on Poverty include Head Start, Job Corps, Adult Basic Education, components of the Workforce Investment Act, the Legal Services Corporation, Weatherization Assistance, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, School Breakfast, the Summer Food Service Program, the Child and Adult Care Food Program, and the Community Services Block Grant. The Great Society also focused on education; both the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the Higher Education Act became law in 1965. ", "The Great Society also saw the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, which have grown into the nation's largest health care programs. Medicare was created in 1965, providing health coverage as a form of social insurance to elderly and disabled individuals with a significant attachment to the workforce. The same legislation created Medicaid, a means-tested entitlement that finances medical services and long-term care for specified low-income and categorical groups. Medicaid replaced two earlier programs of federal grants to states that provided medical care to welfare recipients and the elderly. Both Medicare and Medicaid have been amended numerous times over the years, expanding both eligible populations and services. A prescription drug benefit was added to Medicare in 2003, which includes a subsidy for low-income beneficiaries. And most recently, the 2010 health reform law\u2014the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( P.L. 111-148 , as amended by P.L. 111-152 )\u2014significantly expanded Medicaid, so that, beginning in FY2014 (or potentially sooner, at state option), Medicaid will cover low-income childless adults in addition to the program's traditional target populations of low-income parents and children, and elderly and disabled individuals.", "The original Social Security Act's grants to states for cash aid to needy blind and aged individuals were expanded over time to include people with disabilities. However, in contrast to cash aid and related programs for needy families with children, which remain state-administered, Congress \"federalized\" programs for low-income aged, blind, and disabled people in 1972. These earlier programs were replaced by Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which has uniform federal minimum eligibility and benefit rules (rather than state-determined policies) and serves blind and disabled children as well as adults. ", "Also in the early 1970s, Congress considered but did not enact welfare reform legislation that would have replaced AFDC with a federal minimum cash guarantee for poor families, including working families with two parents. Instead, in 1975 Congress enacted a temporary \"work bonus\" or wage supplement intended to return a portion of Social Security taxes to low-income working households. This program was made permanent in 1978 and became the current Earned\u00a0Income\u00a0Tax Credit (EITC). The credit has been expanded several times over the past 30 years and is currently one of the largest cash assistance programs for low-income households, reflecting the prevailing policy goal of \"make work pay.\" ", "Consistent with the emphasis on promoting work for low-income families, the welfare reform law of 1996 created TANF, which, as noted above, conditions cash aid on participation in work activities, and also expanded funding for child care. In the year following enactment of welfare reform, low-income families not sufficiently poor for Medicaid gained access to health insurance for their children through enactment of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in 1997. The Child Tax Credit and refundable Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) also were created in 1997, although the impact of the ACTC originally was limited. In 2001 and subsequent years, the ACTC was expanded so that it now targets assistance toward low-income families.", "Most recently, Congress enacted the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ) in 2009, in an effort to stimulate the economy during recession. While ARRA did not create significant new initiatives for people with limited income, it revised and expanded certain existing policies, at least temporarily, to make them more responsive to the needs of people and communities affected by the downturn. As the following discussion shows, ARRA resulted in a substantial increase in spending on benefits and services for low-income populations between FY2008 and FY2009. The bulk of funding provided by ARRA was intended to be spent during FY2009 and FY2010."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overview of Federal Spending on Benefits and Services for People with Low Income", "paragraphs": ["Federal spending on benefits and services for low-income people totaled $708 billion in FY2009 and $578 billion in FY2008. These programs generally seek to mitigate the effects of low income by helping people meet basic needs such as health care, food, or shelter, or to address the root causes of economic disadvantage through services, education, or job training. Notably, few programs have poverty reduction as an explicit goal or purpose. Key target populations for many of these programs, including some of the largest, include low-income elderly and disabled individuals, and dependent children and their families. Other target groups for selected programs include veterans, students, people who are homeless, Indians, and refugees, among others.", " Figure 1 illustrates the composition of spending, by category, in FY2008 and FY2009.

See Appendix Table B -1 for a listing of specific programs in each category.", "As Figure 1 shows, spending for health care dominates all other categories, accounting for close to half (45%) of total spending for limited-income populations in FY2009. Cash aid is the second largest category but trails health care by a wide margin, with 18% of spending in FY2009.

Almost two-thirds (64%) of the additional spending was provided under ARRA, the economic stimulus enacted in February 2009. Some large entitlement programs (e.g., Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)) saw additional growth in spending beyond that provided under ARRA, likely due to an increase in eligible and enrolled individuals as a result of the economic downturn.", "Spending growth from FY2008 to FY2009 was uneven among categories. The largest percentage increase was for energy assistance, which represented less than 1% of all spending in FY2008 and more than tripled in FY2009. Spending for housing and development programs rose by 51%, education by 39%, and employment and training by 38%. Spending on food assistance increased between the two years (32%), as did spending for health care (24%) and social services (22%). Spending for cash aid appeared to drop by 3% between FY2008 and FY2009; however, this was the result of a one-time $300-per-child tax rebate, which was included as spending under the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) in FY2008 but was not targeted toward low-income families.", "In terms of dollar increases between the two years, health care saw the largest growth, with $61 billion of additional obligations in FY2009. More than half of this increase (54%) resulted from provisions in ARRA that temporarily raised the federal share of Medicaid costs. However, growth in Medicaid spending\u2014regardless of ARRA\u2014accounted for another 30% of the dollar increase in low-income health spending from FY2008 to FY2009.", "The next largest dollar increase was for housing and development programs, which grew by $20 billion between FY2008 and FY2009. Most of this growth (71%) resulted from additional appropriations provided under ARRA for such programs as Public Housing, Homeless Assistance Grants (specifically for a new Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program), and Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance. ARRA also funded two temporary grants related to the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit.", "Spending for food assistance rose by almost $19 billion between FY2008 and FY2009. More than a quarter of this growth resulted from ARRA provisions that increased the dollar value of SNAP benefits. As noted above, however, SNAP grew significantly regardless of the ARRA provisions, as more households became eligible and enrolled in the program during the recession and its aftermath. Additional SNAP obligations unrelated to ARRA accounted for 60% of the FY2009 spending increase in the food assistance category. ", "Education spending grew by $16 billion from FY2008 to FY2009, although without additional appropriations provided under ARRA, this category would have decreased by $2 billion. However, ARRA was enacted before final decisions were made on total FY2009 appropriations, so appropriators were able to take into consideration the additional amounts already provided through ARRA. Pell Grants for postsecondary students and grants to disadvantaged school districts under Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act were the largest beneficiaries of ARRA funding among education programs specifically targeted on low-income populations.", "Spending for social services rose by $8 billion between FY2008 and FY2009, with almost half of the increase coming from appropriations made by ARRA, specifically for Head Start, the Child Care and Development Fund, and the Community Services Block Grant. Energy spending grew by $7 billion, of which nearly two-thirds (64%) was ARRA funding for the Weatherization Assistance Program. Finally, employment and training saw a $2 billion increase in spending in FY2009, with more than three-quarters (77%) coming from appropriations under ARRA for the Workforce Investment Act and Job Corps.", "As noted above, cash assistance spending appeared to go down in FY2009, by about $4 billion. However, FY2008 obligations in this category included an unspecified amount of spending for a one-time $300-per-child tax rebate, authorized under the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-185 ). This one-time rebate was counted as spending under the ACTC, but was not targeted toward low-income families. Thus, FY2008 spending for low-income people under the ACTC appears higher than it actually was. While ARRA made changes in both the Earned Income Tax Credit and the ACTC, these changes did not take effect until tax year 2009, and therefore associated spending would generally not be seen until FY2010.

These rules determine the amount of spending that will occur, so Congress generally must amend the authorizing law in order to control federal spending. The amount of federal spending for discretionary programs, on the other hand, is determined by Congress through the annual appropriations process. ", "Mandatory spending may be structured as open-ended or capped. In an open-ended entitlement program, no predetermined ceiling is imposed on federal expenditures; instead, federal payments are made to all eligible beneficiaries for eligible expenditures as defined in law. (Medicaid is an example of an open-ended entitlement program.) In a capped program, the authorizing law limits the total amount of federal spending that can occur. (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families is an example of a capped entitlement program.) Of mandatory spending discussed in this report, more than 90% is through open-ended programs.", "The pattern of mandatory versus discretionary spending differs by major category of benefits and services. All cash aid spending, and most spending for health care and food assistance, is mandatory. In all three of these categories, spending occurs largely through open-ended entitlement programs. In contrast, all spending for energy assistance and employment and training, and most spending for housing and development and education, is discretionary. Social services spending is a mixture; about two-thirds is mandatory and the rest is discretionary. Of the mandatory social services spending, a little more than half is capped and the balance is open-ended."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "A Look at the 10 Largest Programs", "paragraphs": ["This report generally looks at spending and policy by major category, such as health care, cash aid, or food assistance. It illustrates the enormous diversity among and within categories in terms of target population and various design elements. However, it is important to note that a few individual programs account for the vast majority of spending for low-income populations, and these programs merit special attention. The four largest programs contributed almost 60% of total spending in each of FY2008 and FY2009, and the top 10 accounted for more than three-fourths. The following provides an overview of these programs; they are discussed in the context of all low-income programs in the balance of the report. Table 2 shows spending for these programs in FY2008 and FY2009, and separately under ARRA. Table 3 highlights key features of these\u00a0programs.", "As Table 2 shows, Medicaid is the single largest program and alone accounts for nearly 40% of low-income spending. Next in size are the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly food stamps), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and the refundable portion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Notably, SNAP became the second largest program in FY2009 but was number four in spending in FY2008, behind SSI and EITC. Rounding out the top 10 are Pell Grants, the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), the low-income drug subsidy under Part D of Medicare, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers. ", "Because of the effect of Medicaid, more than half (53% in FY2009) of spending under the top 10 programs fell into the health category. Spending for programs in the cash assistance category equaled 23% of spending under the 10 largest programs in FY2009, followed by programs categorized as food assistance (10%) and education (9%). Small percentages of total spending for the top 10 programs went to those categorized as housing (3%), social services (2%), and employment and training (less than 1%).", "Low-income elderly, disabled, and families with dependent children are the focus of much of the spending under the top 10 programs. Medicaid provides health care for low-income people within certain categorical groups, which are primarily the elderly, individuals with disabilities, and dependent children and their families. Low-income elderly and disabled Medicare recipients receive subsidized prescription drug insurance under Part D. Cash aid goes to low-income elderly and disabled beneficiaries under SSI, and to low-income working households through the EITC and ACTC. TANF serves families with dependent children; states define specific eligibility rules but federal law emphasizes participation in work activities for recipients of cash aid.", "SNAP provides assistance specifically for the purchase of food to households below a certain income threshold. While the program does not target benefits to certain demographic groups, nearly half of SNAP recipients in FY2009 were children and another 8% were age 60 or older. The law also requires able-bodied non-elderly adults without dependent children to participate in work or training to receive benefits for more than a brief period of time. ", "The 10 largest programs also include housing vouchers for low-income families (\"families\" are defined by local public housing authorities and may include single individuals). Two education programs are among the top 10, including Pell Grants, which assist students whose family resources are not adequate to meet their college costs. The system used to determine benefit amounts under Pell sometimes gives aid to students with relatively high family income; however, the benefits given to these students are likely to be low. Finally, low-income school districts receive grants through Title I-A of ESEA, but individual students do not necessarily have to be low-income to be served by the program.", "As noted earlier, about 75% of all spending for limited-income populations is classified as mandatory. This percentage is higher for the top 10 programs; close to 90% of spending under these programs is mandatory, which means the amount spent is a function of program rules set forth in law rather than annual decisions made by congressional appropriators. Moreover, of mandatory programs in the top 10, only TANF is capped; the rest are open-ended. Three of the top 10 programs are classified as discretionary. These are Pell Grants (which also includes a mandatory component), Title I-A of ESEA, and housing vouchers. ", "With one exception, the 10 largest programs all require that beneficiaries must be determined individually eligible to receive aid. In other words, except for Title I-A of ESEA, individuals or households must meet an income (or equivalent) test to benefit from these programs. The particular income test used, however, varies with the program. For example, Medicaid, SNAP, and the Part D subsidy all use different multiples of the federal poverty guidelines to determine eligibility, in addition to criteria that allow beneficiaries of certain other programs to qualify automatically. Specific dollar amounts are used to define eligibility for SSI and also to determine when EITC benefits begin to phase out. Section 8 housing vouchers use income limits that are based on area median income to define eligibility, and TANF income eligibility thresholds, as noted earlier, are set by states. No absolute income threshold determines eligibility for Pell Grants; however, the lowest-income students receive the largest grants. ", "As stated above, children are not required to meet an income eligibility test to receive benefits funded by Title I-A of ESEA. Rather, the program uses allocation formulas to direct federal resources toward local educational agencies with relatively high concentrations of low-income students. Once these funds are received by an individual school, students may be served regardless of their family income.", "Title I-A is an example of a formula grant program. (Other mechanisms for distributing funds include competitive or discretionary awards, and direct benefits to individuals.) Medicaid, TANF, and Section 8 housing vouchers also use formulas to distribute funds, but the specifics vary. Because Medicaid is an open-ended entitlement, the federal government reimburses states for all eligible expenditures with no cap on federal spending; however, the federal \"matching rate\" is calculated for each state by a formula inversely related to its per capita income (poorer states get a larger federal match, and wealthier states get a smaller federal match). TANF allocates block grants to states according to a formula that considers their spending patterns under the predecessor Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. Funding to renew existing housing vouchers is distributed to local public housing authorities (not states) according to a formula established by Congress each year in appropriations law, which typically is related to the use and cost of vouchers in the local area. ", "As noted above, formula grants are one of three major ways that federal programs for low-income populations distribute funds; the other two are competitive or discretionary awards, and direct benefits to individuals. None of the 10 largest programs award funds on a competitive or discretionary basis, other than a relatively small component of TANF. Instead, these large programs either allocate funds to states or another unit of government by formula, as just described, or give benefits to eligible individuals directly (or through a nongovernment intermediary). Federal benefits are provided directly under SNAP (although states administer the program), SSI (although states may supplement the federal benefit), EITC, ACTC, Pell Grants, and the Medicare Part D subsidy.", "Benefits provided by the federal government directly to eligible individuals typically are 100% federally funded, although, as noted above, states incur administrative costs under SNAP (which are reimbursed at a 50% federal rate) and may supplement federal payments under SSI. Some states also operate their own earned income tax credit programs, which supplement the federal EITC. Medicaid and TANF, however, are federal-state programs, and states must spend a significant amount of their own money to receive federal funds. As noted above, state Medicaid expenditures are reimbursed by the federal government at prescribed matching rates. Unlike Medicaid, TANF is not a matching grant; however, to receive TANF block grant funds, states must maintain a certain level of their own spending from prior years. Local educational agencies that receive Title I-A grants also are required to maintain a certain amount of prior-year spending and must use federal funds to \"supplement and not supplant\" nonfederal funds that would otherwise be used for the same purpose.

", "More typically, matching programs require grantees to demonstrate that they can provide nonfederal resources equal to a percentage of the federal grant, but the federal government is not necessarily reimbursing grantees for expenditures already incurred. Some federal programs require the nonfederal share to be in cash, but many also allow in-kind contributions (e.g., the value of donated real estate or other property, the services of volunteers). Programs with nonfederal matching requirements include the Ryan White program for people with HIV/AIDS, Breast/Cervical Cancer Early Detection, and the Maternal and Child Health block grant; Older Americans Act nutrition and social services programs; the Public Works and Economic Development program, certain Homeless Assistance Grants, and HOME; Adult Basic Education, Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants, and GEAR-UP; Head Start, State Councils on Developmental Disabilities, the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program; Community Service Employment for Older Americans, and Foster Grandparents.", "As noted above, some programs use maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirements to ensure a minimum level of nonfederal spending. A key example is TANF, which requires states to spend annually at least 75% of the amount they had spent under the predecessor AFDC program in FY1994 (or 80% if they fail to meet certain work participation requirements). Other programs with MOE provisions include School Lunch, The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), Title I-A of ESEA, and CCDF.", "Education programs in particular use the \"supplement and not supplant\" concept, which provides that grantees may not use federal funds to replace nonfederal (or in some cases, other federal) funds that would otherwise have been used for the same purpose.

Moreover, individuals who are American Indians or Native Americans likely participate in many programs for limited-income populations, not because of their heritage or tribal affiliation but because they otherwise meet a program's eligibility rules.", "Examples of programs for which tribes and tribal organizations or other Indian entities are explicitly eligible to participate include the Ryan White program and Breast/Cervical Cancer Early Detection; WIC and TEFAP; Water and Waste Disposal grants and loans, Public Works and Economic Development, Homeless Assistance Grants, and HOME; Institutional Aid for colleges and universities; the Community Service Employment Program for Older Americans, Foster Grandparents and Job Corps.

The specific territories that are eligible to participate, however, and the rules that apply to their participation vary by program. Territories may or may not actually participate in all programs for which they are eligible. In addition, Title V of P.L. 95-134 authorizes federal agencies to consolidate grants for certain territories, specifically American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (which include Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau). ", "A detailed discussion of the eligibility of U.S. territories and their rules of participation, by program, is beyond the scope of this report.

However, while some formula grants apply the same general policies to Puerto Rico that apply to states, they sometimes use different criteria to determine its funding level. Formula grants often set aside a percentage or specific amount of funds to be made available to specified territories, subject to their meeting program-related criteria, while discretionary or competitive grants often include the territories among the various other entities and organizations that are eligible to apply."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Benefit Levels Under Selected Cash and Near-Cash Programs", "paragraphs": ["This report generally does not discuss the value of benefits and services received under programs targeted toward low-income people. For many of the programs included here, the process of quantifying their value is complex. Moreover, there may be different ways to look at the value of a particular benefit. For example, the value of Medicaid could be considered its \"market value\" (what a family would have to pay in the private insurance market to purchase comparable coverage), or it could be considered the amount of a family's resources that are \"freed up\" as a result of Medicaid coverage and therefore available to purchase other goods and services. ", "Estimating the value of benefits provided under the range of education, housing, food assistance, and service programs included in this report raises similarly difficult questions. For many programs, benefit computations depend on factors that vary for each individual case. For example, rental assistance is a function of both family income and the fair market rent of a particular housing unit. Pell Grants and certain other higher education benefits are calculated based on a family's available resources and the cost of attendance at the student's particular college or university. In other words, both housing programs and student aid consider the cost of goods and services (i.e., the rent for a particular apartment or the cost at a particular school) as a component in the benefit calculation, in addition to an individual's income and/or assets.", "Calculating the value of cash and near-cash benefits (such as SNAP) is somewhat more straightforward. However, even with cash and near-cash benefits, the amount an individual or family receives depends on their specific circumstances, and the benefit computation can be complicated. Under certain programs, benefits are larger for larger family sizes, reflecting greater need. Benefits are generally reduced when a family has other sources of cash income, such as earnings or Social Security benefits.", " Table 6 shows the maximum benefit, under each program's specific rules, for certain individuals and family types from cash assistance programs, specifically SSI, EITC, ACTC, veterans' pensions, and TANF. It also shows the maximum benefit amounts under the \"near-cash\" SNAP program. Benefit amounts are shown for FY2008 and FY2009 (the years covered by this report) and, for comparison, FY2011. The table shows either maximum monthly benefits or maximum annual benefits, depending on the program, with annual benefits also shown as per month equivalents, to allow comparison. Benefits are shown for different family sizes; however, for the ACTC, the maximum benefit shown is per child . There is no limit on the number of eligible children for whom the credit may be claimed in an individual family. For TANF, the benefit levels shown are for families and households with no other source of family income, who also are in compliance with behavioral rules (notably, work requirements). ", "SSI, EITC, veterans' pensions, and SNAP are generally adjusted each year for price inflation. However, SNAP benefits were raised by ARRA, which effectively suspended benefit adjustments in 2010 and 2011. SSI and veterans' benefit adjustments are tied to Social Security cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs); there were no such COLAs for 2010 and 2011 because of the low rate of price inflation accompanying the economic downturn that began in 2007. EITC benefits are also adjusted for price changes through indexing to the Consumer Price Index; ACTC benefits are not\u00a0indexed.", "SSI, EITC, ACTC, veterans' pensions, and SNAP benefits are determined in federal law. It should be noted that states can also supplement SSI benefits with their own funds and many states also have their own EITCs that can increase benefits for families above the amounts shown in the\u00a0table. ", "TANF benefits are set by the states, and vary greatly from one state to another. States typically do not make regular adjustments for price inflation. Rather, states make ad-hoc adjustments to TANF cash benefits. The table shows maximum TANF cash benefits for states with the highest benefits (Alaska) and with the lowest benefits (Tennessee for family size of two, Mississippi for family size of three). Benefit levels remained the same for cash assistance recipients in these states in 2008 and 2009. However, some states did increase benefit amounts, as illustrated by the slight increase in the median state maximum benefit for both a family of two and a family of three."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Final Notes and Outstanding Questions", "paragraphs": ["Federal programs providing benefits and services to low-income people are extremely diverse and are rarely looked at collectively. These programs and their underlying policies evolved over many decades; they were created to achieve different policy goals in response to different perceived policy problems. Their common feature is an explicit focus on low-income populations.", "This report provides a snapshot of policies and spending in FY2008 and FY2009 on specified categories of benefits and services for low-income people. It looks at the broad purposes of these programs and then focuses primarily on concepts used to determine eligibility for individual participants and to distribute federal resources according to need. The report also briefly examines the units of government or other entities that receive and administer these federal funds.", "Numerous additional questions can be raised about this collection of benefits and services targeted toward low-income people. For example, the report does not address programs' effectiveness in meeting their policy goals, either individually or by category. A comprehensive review of program evaluations is beyond the scope of this report; moreover, a consistent body of evaluation literature on all programs for low-income populations is not available. Likewise, the report generally does not attempt to quantify the benefits provided under these programs, for reasons stated in the previous section. ", "Many programs included in this report rely on the federal poverty guidelines for determining income eligibility, or population statistics based on federal poverty thresholds to allocate funds. In addition to issues raised by use of different multiples of the poverty guidelines by different programs, the guidelines themselves\u2014and the thresholds on which they are based\u2014are the subject of considerable controversy. ", "Despite different eligibility rules, using various concepts in addition to the federal poverty guidelines, many federal programs for low-income people have overlapping target populations. However, these programs were not necessarily designed intentionally to be consistent with or complementary to one another. Thus, questions can be raised\u2014about potential duplication, the ease with which people can understand and access benefits or services, whether gaps exist among programs in terms of eligibility and available benefits, and the efficiency of service delivery mechanisms. The variety of targeting provisions raises questions about equity and whether \"need\" is addressed uniformly across the country.", "As for the level of participation in federal low-income programs, the fact sheets in Appendix C provide very limited data, primarily to give a sense of scope for each program. However, many questions can be asked about participation in these programs, both individually and collectively. For example, what percent of eligible beneficiaries are served or participate in each program? Assuming most programs do not serve everyone eligible, what are the characteristics of those who actually participate? Are programs targeting the lowest-income individuals, or do other criteria determine who gets served? For programs with overlapping target populations, to what extent are people served under multiple programs?", "Administrative data for some programs provide information about the number and characteristics of participants, but these data are inconsistent across programs, and cannot be used in combination to get a picture of multiple program participation. The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), administered by the Census Bureau, provides some insight. The most recent SIPP data, for the third quarter of 2008, indicate that about 28.4 million households\u201424% of total households in the United States\u2014received cash or noncash benefits under one or more means-tested program in an average month. Most often, these programs were Medicaid, free and reduced-price school meals, or SNAP; other programs included housing assistance, SSI, TANF, WIC, LIHEAP, and veterans' pensions. Notably, however, the SIPP data do not identify the extent to which households receive benefits under the EITC or ACTC, although these cash assistance programs are among the 10 largest federal benefits for low-income people. ", "Returning to the discussion of benefits and services by category, Figure 1 clearly demonstrates that certain categories\u2014most notably health\u2014have grown larger than others. The relative size of the programs, the budgetary classification of their spending (e.g., discretionary or mandatory, open-ended or capped), and the diversity of design elements have implications for the ability of lawmakers to enact new policies, change existing policies, or adjust spending priorities in a time of fiscal constraint.", "Finally, the report notes that many programs for low-income people operate through formula grants, typically to states. Many of these programs require states, or sometimes other entities within states, to spend a certain amount of nonfederal funds to access their full federal grant. Even in some programs that provide benefits directly to individuals, such as SNAP or SSI, states play a role in determining eligibility or conducting other administrative functions and, in some cases, in supplementing the federal benefits provided. In the current fiscal environment, with many state budgets in critical condition, the ability of states to fully access federal funding and to maintain their level of support for low-income benefits and services is an outstanding question. At the same time, continued federal spending on these benefits and services is at issue, in light of current concerns about the size of federal deficits and long-term debt.", "Appendix A. Methodology of Report", "Selection of Programs", "Programs were selected for inclusion in this report if they (1) have provisions that base an individual's eligibility or priority for service on a measure (or proxy) of low or limited income; or (2) target resources in some way (e.g., through allocation formulas, variable matching rates) using a measure (or proxy) of low or limited income. ", "A few programs without an explicit low-income provision were included because either their target population is disproportionately poor or their purpose clearly indicates a presumption that participants will be low-income. Such programs that serve disproportionately low-income people include the Indian Health Service, Homeless Assistance Grants, Indian Education, Title I Migrant Education Program, and Indian Human Services. Programs with purposes that presume a low-income target population include Adult Basic Education and Social Services Block Grants.", "Federal student loan programs were considered for inclusion because they determine benefit levels through the same need analysis system that is used for Pell Grants and several smaller postsecondary education programs. However, this system can result in students from relatively well-off families receiving assistance, as there is no absolute income ceiling on eligibility. Pell Grants are structured in such a way that the majority of recipients are low-income and the lowest-income students receive the largest benefits. Student loan programs are not as strongly targeted and therefore, are not included in the report. ", "On the other hand, deliberations about whether to include the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) reached a different conclusion. The regular Child Tax Credit (CTC) is a nonrefundable credit and phases out at relatively high income levels. The ACTC is a refundable credit that allows families with no or insufficient tax liability to get all or part of the benefit they would otherwise receive from the CTC. Because of the refundable nature and other design features of the ACTC, including certain recently enacted changes, it serves predominantly low-income families. For example, for tax year 2008, 87% of returns that claimed the ACTC were filed by families with adjusted gross incomes (AGI) below $40,000 and 83% of the credit went to such families; 94% of returns that claimed the ACTC were filed by families with AGI below $50,000 and 93% of the credit went to such families. Thus, ACTC is included in the report.", "Categorization of Programs", "Most programs are easily assigned to broad categories, such as health, cash aid, food assistance, or education. A few, however, have multiple purposes or allowable activities. For some of those programs, spending can be disaggregated into the relevant categories. For example, using state reporting of actual expenditures, it is possible to estimate the amount of TANF obligations attributable to cash aid, social services, and employment and training. Other programs cannot be disaggregated, however, and must be assigned to a single category. For example, Transitional Cash and Medical Services for Refugees was categorized as health care, and Indian Human Services was categorized as social services although it also provides cash and housing assistance. ", "The social services category, in general, is not well-defined and some analysts might assign some programs differently. Head Start, for example, could be considered an education program, since its purpose is to promote school readiness; however, it supports a very broad range of activities\u2014including for children age 0-3 through its Early Head Start component\u2014that can best be characterized collectively as social services. Foster Care and Adoption Assistance both give cash to families or other care providers, but income support is not the programs' purpose or sole use of funding. Foster Care subsidizes maintenance payments and administrative activities on behalf of children who cannot remain safely at home, and Adoption Assistance makes payments to facilitate the adoption of children who would otherwise lack permanent homes. Thus, in this report, these programs were categorized as social services and not cash assistance. ", "Selection of Spending Measure", "New obligations incurred in the indicated fiscal year were chosen as the measure of spending for this report, although for many programs, readers may be more accustomed to seeing appropriations (budget authority) or outlays. These spending concepts are related. Congress and the President enact budget authority through appropriations measures or other authorizing laws. Budget authority in turn allows federal agencies to incur obligations , through actions such as entering into contracts, employing personnel, and submitting purchase orders. Outlays represent the actual payment of these obligations, usually in the form of electronic transfers or checks issued by the Treasury Department. Obligations are used in this report because they are the most consistent measure available at the necessary level of detail for the majority of programs. The source of obligations data is the U.S. Budget Appendix for FY2011 (for final FY2009 obligations) and FY2010 (for final FY2008 obligations).", "Obligations were either not available or not appropriate for a small number of programs. Because obligations were not available at the necessary program level, appropriations were used for the following: Transitional Cash and Medical Services for Refugees, Breast/Cervical Cancer Early Detection, the Title I Migrant Education Program, Social Services and Targeted Assistance for Refugees, and Foster Grandparents.", "For veterans' medical care, the Budget Appendix shows obligations for the entire program, and not solely the income-tested component. Thus, for this report, estimated obligations for Priority Group 5 veterans (needy veterans without service-connected disabilities) were calculated from Department of Veterans Affairs data on obligations for Priority Groups 1-6 and 7-8 and number of patients receiving care by individual priority group. ", "The Budget Appendix also does not show obligations solely for the low-income subsidy portion of the Medicare Part D prescription drug program. Therefore, the report uses aggregate reimbursements for the low-income subsidy for the calendar year (instead of fiscal year), available from the annual report of the Medicare trustees.", "Loan subsidy outlays were used as the more appropriate measure of spending for the Section 502 single-family rural housing loan program. Direct and guaranteed loan subsidy outlays, available from the Budget Appendix, were adjusted for re-estimates provided in the Federal Credit Supplement to the U.S. Budget for the relevant years.", "Finally, as noted above, TANF obligations provided in the Budget Appendix were disaggregated into the categories of cash aid, social services, and employment and training, based on states' reporting to the Department of Health and Human Services of their actual expenditures. ", "Spending Threshold", "Programs are included in this report if they had obligations in either FY2008 or FY2009 of at least $100 million. To simplify the analysis without significantly changing the overall picture, smaller programs were excluded, even if they met the low-income criteria. Only one program included in the report\u2014Education for Homeless Children and Youth\u2014had spending above the threshold in one year but below the threshold in the other. Therefore, spending totals for FY2009 include obligations for this program, but spending totals for FY2008 do not. Thus, each year's spending total is a snapshot of spending in that year for low-income programs which\u2014 in that year \u2014had obligations totaling at least $100 million. ", "Comparison with Predecessor CRS Report Series", "From 1979 to 2006, the Congressional Research Service issued a series of reports, typically every other year, called Cash and Noncash Benefits for Persons with Limited Income . The series was conceived and produced (except for the last edition in 2006) by [author name scrubbed], Specialist in Social Policy, who retired from CRS in 2004.", "The current report is meant to replace the Cash and Noncash series. However, this report uses different methodologies to select and categorize programs and measure spending; therefore, the current report cannot be considered an update of Cash and Noncash for various reasons. For example, the older series did not include certain programs that are included in this report, such as the low-income subsidy under Medicare Part D, Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and Community Development Block Grants. At the same time, the older series had no minimum spending threshold, so it included several smaller programs that are not included here. In addition, the older series included student loans, which are not included in this report for reasons explained above. Several programs were also categorized differently in the previous series (e.g., Head Start was categorized as education; Foster Care and Adoption Assistance as cash aid; and Homeless Assistance Grants as social services). The older series used different measures of spending for different programs, while this report uses obligations where possible. The older series also provided estimates of state-local spending, which are not included in this report. Finally, the older series traced spending back to 1968, which is beyond the scope of the current report. Changes in programs and appropriations accounts over time make it virtually impossible to trace obligations backward with precision.", "Appendix B.

Within categories, programs are listed in order of their Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number (see Appendix C ).", " Table B -1 shows obligations (or another measure of spending, as noted) for each program for FY2008 and FY2009. ARRA amounts are included in the FY2009 amounts; they are also shown in a separate column. The table also indicates the federal administering agency for each program.", " Table B -2 identifies, for each program, the general target population and the concept (or multiple concepts) used to determine individual income eligibility and (if relevant) the concept used to target federal resources broadly based on need. These concepts are discussed in detail earlier in the report. The table indicates the general concept used but not the specific application of the concept. For example, the table might indicate that federal poverty guidelines (FPG) are used as a concept in determining income eligibility for a particular program, but does not indicate what percent of FPG is used. Likewise, the table might show that a program uses formula allocation factors to direct federal resources toward areas with the greatest need, but does not identify the specific factors or their weighting or any mitigating factors, such as small-state minimums or hold-harmless provisions. Readers are referred to the fact sheets in Appendix C , relevant CRS reports, or the statutes themselves for these details.", " Table B -3 shows the type of federal assistance provided (typically formula grants, competitive or discretionary grants, or direct benefits) and the immediate recipients of this assistance. As noted in the table, \"immediate\" recipient refers to the level of government or the organization that directly receives the federal grant or award. As discussed in the body of the report, many programs require that funds be further distributed (by formula or other criteria) to other units of government or organizations. For example, federal grants may be awarded by formula to states, but states are then required to subaward these funds to local governments or other entities. This table only shows the \"immediate\" grantee.

In general, for separate CHIP programs under which the majority of children are enrolled, states may offer one of three \"benchmark\" benefit packages: (1) the standard Blue Cross/Blue Shield preferred provider plan offered under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), (2) the health coverage that is offered and generally available to state employees, and (3) the health coverage that is offered by a health maintenance organization (HMO) with the largest commercial (non-Medicaid) enrollment in the state. (States also have the option of providing \"Secretary-approved\" coverage for which benefits are suitable for the target population.) States that use the Medicaid expansion option can provide the full range of mandatory Medicaid benefits as well as all optional services specified in their state Medicaid plans. Alternatively, under a CHIP Medicaid expansion, states may offer benchmark benefit plans similar to those listed above. States may also waive many of the basic benefit rules described above to conduct demonstration projects under Section 1115 authority that test alternative methods of meeting the overall purpose of CHIP. Medicaid expansion programs must follow the nominal Medicaid cost-sharing rules or, for certain populations, may apply alternative higher premiums and service-related cost-sharing. States with separate CHIP programs may vary cost-sharing requirements by family income, but the total annual aggregate cost-sharing (including premiums, copayments, and similar charges) for a family may not exceed 5% of total income in a year, and certain services such as preventive care are exempt from cost-sharing.", "Individual eligibility criteria: Target populations are defined by states within federal parameters. Children must be under age 19, lack health insurance, and not be qualified for regular Medicaid. States may set the upper income limit for targeted children at up to 200% of federal poverty guidelines or 50 percentage points above the applicable pre-CHIP (1997) Medicaid income level. States may seek federal approval to serve higher-income children. States also may cover pregnant women who lack health insurance and meet specified income thresholds.

Allows participation by territories (American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands).", "Allocation formula: The allotment methodology was changed by CHIPRA, beginning with FY2009. Rather than dividing the entire national appropriation among states, the law now calculates allotment amounts for each state, which they will receive unless the national appropriation is inadequate. The new allotment formula is based primarily on states' past and/or projected federal CHIP spending (depending on the year) increased by a growth factor. For FY2009 onward, annual allotments are available for two years, with unspent funds available for redistribution first to shortfall states and then for bonus payments directed at states that exceed certain child enrollment levels and that implement certain outreach and enrollment initiatives. Prior to CHIPRA, funds were allocated among states according to a formula based on a combination of the number of low-income children and low-income uninsured children in the state, and including a cost factor that represented average health service industry wages in the state compared to the national average. ", "Matching or related requirements: State expenditures are matched at an \"enhanced\" federal medical assistance percentage (E-FMAP).

Federal law defines more than 50 potentially eligible population groups; some groups are mandatory (all states must cover them) and others are optional (states may cover them at their discretion). In some cases, income eligibility standards are tied directly to specified percentages of the federal poverty guidelines. For example, Medicaid mandatory coverage groups include pregnant women and children under age 6 with family incomes at or below 133% of poverty; children ages 6-18 with family incomes at or below 100% of poverty; certain parents and children in working families who are entitled to Medicaid for at least 6 months and up to 12 months if their income does not exceed 185% of poverty (i.e., Transitional Medical Assistance, TMA)); individuals who qualify for Medicare Part A whose incomes do not exceed 100% of poverty (Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMBs)); and individuals who are entitled to Medicare Part A with incomes between 100% and 120% of poverty (Specified Low-Income Beneficiaries (SLMs)).
