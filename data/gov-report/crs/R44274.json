FMLA leave is job-protected, which means that\u2014with few exceptions\u2014an employer must return the employee to the same job or to one that is equivalent in terms of pay, benefits, working conditions, and responsibilities to the one held prior to taking leave. 4.

Through the act, Congress sought to strike a balance between workplace responsibilities and workers' growing need to take leave for significant family and medical events. ", "The act as passed in 1993 focused on providing an entitlement to leave for the arrival of a newborn or newly-placed child, serious health conditions in the family, and the employee's own serious health condition that interferes with his or her ability to perform essential job functions. In passing the act, Congress cited an increase in dual-earner and single-parent households that reduced the share of families with a caregiver at home. This, alongside an aging population, increased workers' needs for workplace flexibility to attend to significant family and medical events. In 2008 and 2009, Congress responded to a heightened need for leave among military families (connected to large-scale deployments) by adding new categories of leave that allow eligible employees to address certain military exigencies stemming from the deployment of a close family member to a foreign country, and to care for a servicemember with a serious injury or illness who is a close family member.", "Congress recognized the potential for the FMLA leave entitlement to complicate scheduling for employers and otherwise disrupt business activity. It addressed business interests by placing clear parameters around the types of leave covered by the act, linking employer coverage and employee eligibility to the size of the employer's workforce, conditioning employee eligibility on job tenure and hours-worked requirements, and giving employers the right to advance notice of need for leave and to request medical documentation in certain circumstances.", "FMLA applies to covered employers and eligible employees in the private and public sectors.

Inpatient care and continuing treatment are further defined by DOL regulations, resulting in six scenarios that qualify as a serious health condition for the purpose of taking FMLA leave. ", "1. Inpatient care. FMLA leave may be taken for inpatient care that includes an overnight stay in a medical facility (e.g., hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility). FMLA protects the time spent in inpatient care, and any associated period of incapacitation and treatment. 2. Incapacity and treatment. FMLA leave may be used for a period of incapacity that lasts more than three consecutive calendar days and requires either two or more in-person visits with a health care provider, or a single in-person visit that results in a course of continuing treatment under a health care provider's supervision. In the context of the FMLA, incapacity refers to \"an inability to work, attend school or perform other regular daily activities due to the serious health condition, treatment therefore, or recovery therefrom.\" 3. Pregnancy or prenatal care. FMLA leave may be used for any period of incapacity due to pregnancy or for prenatal care. There is no requirement tying use of FMLA leave for pregnancy or prenatal care to a specific duration of incapacity or treatment by a health care provider. It may be used as needed, for example, by expectant mothers (or to care for an expectant mother) experiencing severe morning sickness. 4. Chronic conditions . FMLA leave may be taken for treatment of or incapacity due to a chronic serious health condition. A chronic serious health condition is one that requires periodic visits\u2014at least twice a year\u2014for medical treatment, continues over an extended period of time, and may cause episodic or continuing periods of incapacity (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy). 5. Long-term or permanent conditions. FMLA may be used for a long-term or permanent period of incapacity due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective, as long as the employee or family member is under the continuing supervision of (although not necessarily receiving treatment from) a health care provider. 6. Certain conditions requiring multiple treatments . FMLA leave may be used for any absence to receive and recover from multiple medical treatments for restorative surgery after an injury or accident, or for a condition that would likely result in a period of incapacity lasting three or more consecutive calendar days if not treated. Examples of such conditions include cancer (e.g., chemotherapy), severe arthritis (e.g., physical therapy), or kidney disease (e.g., dialysis).", "As demonstrated by the above list, FMLA leave cannot be used ordinarily for a minor ailment or for routine doctor's appointments. To give an example, the common cold generally does not meet the criteria of a serious health condition. In most cases it does not require an overnight stay in a medical facility and is unlikely to meet the regulatory definition of continuing treatment (e.g., three or more days of incapacitation and intervention by a health care provider). However, leave necessitated by a common cold is not excluded per se from protection under the act. If, for example, a common cold did lead to overnight hospitalization (e.g., due to complications or other factors), then it would be considered a serious health condition under FMLA and the absence\u2014including periods of incapacitation, hospitalization, and subsequent treatment and recovery periods\u2014would be protected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Qualified Military Exigency", "paragraphs": ["The act allows eligible employees to use FMLA leave to attend to qualified military exigencies stemming from the covered active duty status (or call to active duty) of a spouse, child, or parent who is a member of the Armed Forces (regular or reserve component).
