The price the VA pays for a drug is the lowest price as determined through one of four methods, less an additional 5% prime vendor discount: (1) the federal ceiling price, (2) federal supply schedule, (3) performance-based incentive agreement, or (4) national standardization contract. Drug reimbursement costs under Medicaid are calculated differently for single-source (only one Food and Drug Administration-approved product) and multiple-source drugs (more than one FDA-approved product).

There are substantial differences between Medicare and VA that draw into question whether one experience could be indicative of the other. The VA is a direct provider of care, and has its own health care facilities. As a result, the VA has a national formulary as well as its own warehouses. The VA, through its health care system, is the purchaser of prescription drugs. In contrast, the Medicare program is an insurer that pays for care that is delivered to covered beneficiaries in a myriad of sites. Under the new Part D, which relies on prescription drug plans (PDPs) or Medicare Advantage managed care plans offering a prescription drug benefit (MA-PDs) to provide the drug benefit, Medicare is one step further removed in its relationship with the beneficiary.", "Cost-sharing is quite different for Medicare beneficiaries compared with VA beneficiaries, with incentives that might lead to corresponding differences in behavior. The VA charges veterans in certain income and eligibility categories an $8 copay for each 30-day-or-less supply of outpatient medication. Also, the VA does not have annual deductible requirements for beneficiaries. As a result, there is no financial incentive for the beneficiary to prefer one drug over another. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) found no adverse health care effects among VA beneficiaries as a result of encouraging providers to use the drugs on the formulary. In contrast, Medicare Part D plans have created more tiers in their Medicare offerings than they have for their non-Medicare business, and instituted varied types of drug utilization management, including step therapy, prior authorization, and quantity limits. These financial incentives are aimed toward influencing the choice of drugs by covered Medicare beneficiaries as well as cost-containment.", "The VA devotes significant efforts toward the development of its formulary. About 2% of the drug classes on VA's national formulary are designated closed or preferred. For closed classes, VA providers must prescribe and pharmacies must dispense the selected drug, although case-by-case exceptions are allowed. In preferred classes, VA providers and pharmacies are encouraged to prescribe and dispense the preferred drug, but may substitute other drugs in the same class on the formulary without obtaining an exception. These efforts have been successful for the VA, but the implications for Medicare are unclear. Whether CMS would undertake a similar effort and manage the formulary as strictly is uncertain.", "Finally, the VA relies substantially on dispensing prescription drugs by mail.

In addition, the federal share of payments for those drugs available from multiple sources is subject to a federal upper reimbursement limit (FUL).

Until January 1, 2007, federal reimbursements for multiple-source drugs were subject to a FUL calculation tied to the average wholesale price (AWP). The FUL is a measure developed by CMS for use by state Medicaid programs in reimbursing drugs that have at least three generic equivalents.

The best price calculation is based on discounts provided to any purchaser, excluding the Department of Veterans Affairs (and on behalf of the Department of Defense, the Indian Health Service, and the Public Health Service), state pharmaceutical assistance programs, any depot prices and single award contract prices, as defined by the Secretary, of any agency of the federal government, and Medicare Part D plans. Data on prescription drug prices are reported to the Secretary, and rebates are calculated to ensure that Medicaid pays the lowest price. In return for entering into agreements with the Secretary, state Medicaid programs are required to cover the drugs marketed by those manufacturers.

First, the Medicaid program obtains significant discounts through the FUL and rebate programs that are de facto mandatory. Cost savings are obtained through statutory authority with little or no bargaining involved, and minimum percentage discounts are specified in statute. The Medicare Part D program is not currently structured for the federal government to impose similar discounts or to establish administered prices for drugs, nor for price negotiations regarding prescription drugs. The Medicare program does collect information about rebates from Part D plans, but has not used the data for purposes of obtaining lower drug prices from the plans.", "Second, in contrast to the explicit prohibition in the non-interference provision against federally established formularies for Medicare beneficiaries, states are allowed to establish \"open\" formularies for beneficiaries not enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans. All drugs offered by manufacturers with a drug rebate agreement must be covered, and all drugs must be available through a review process unless they are on the list of excluded categories. In addition, states are permitted to subject to prior authorization any covered outpatient drug. Using this authority, some states have instituted prior authorization programs using preferred drug lists, requiring that non-preferred drugs be subject to prior authorization. Litigation over states' use of preferred drug lists has occurred; however, courts have rejected arguments that Medicaid preferred drug lists are in essence formularies that do not meet the requirements of the Medicaid statute. In upholding the use of preferred drug lists for prior authorization programs, courts have noted that such lists do not place any drugs in a non-covered category, the essence of a \"formulary,\" and that the Medicaid statute specifically provides that \"[a] prior authorization program established by a State under paragraph (5) is not a formulary.\"", "If the non-interference provision and formulary and price setting restrictions are repealed, the Secretary must still decide whether or not to adopt a formulary and decide how restrictive it might be. At the national level, these decisions would be much more difficult and problematic. If the formulary prohibition is not repealed and other forms of negotiating leverage are not provided, then the bargaining power of the Secretary would reflect the leverage available to the Secretary through authority granted elsewhere in statute\u2014for instance, his ability to encourage, conduct, and disseminate research on drug prices and their comparative effectiveness, the ability to review and approve plan bids, and the strength of the Secretary's influence through persuasion, as well as other credible threats."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Consequences of Increased Federal Involvement in the Determination of Drug Prices and Costs", "paragraphs": ["If the Secretary were to engage in activities that affect drug prices on behalf of Medicare Part D beneficiaries, the implications could be wide-ranging and potentially quite significant.

By using the market power of roughly 43.7 million Medicare beneficiaries, proponents argue that the pharmaceutical companies would provide deep discounts to the federal government in order to prevent the loss of a significant portion of their market.", "A Government Accountability Office (GAO) study based on data from the mid-1990s found that average VA-negotiated prices are less than 50% of the non-federal average manufacturer's price. In 2000, GAO reported that the prices paid by the Department of Defense (DOD) and VA for 21 brand-name drugs with no generic equivalents were 27% and 30% lower on average than those certified to the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA, now the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) as \"best price.\"", "However, there is uncertainty about the potential effectiveness of the federal government in obtaining drug price discounts that are greater than those currently negotiated by private Medicare Part D plans. The first year of experience with the Medicare prescription drug benefit has produced lower-than-expected program expenditures, which supporters of the program attribute to the lower drug prices that drug plans have been able to negotiate in response to strong competition. Critics counter that the lower expenditures are a result of lower-than-expected enrollment and a preference among enrolled beneficiaries for plans with lower premiums and less generous drug coverage.", "The argument that the size of the Medicare market would provide federal negotiators with an advantage over private plans in obtaining discounts from pharmaceutical manufacturers has been questioned. Large PBMs, such as Advance PCS (75 million covered individuals), Medco Health Solutions (65 million) and Express Scripts (57 million) have significant market power and an established track record in negotiating prescription drug discounts for large populations. The size of the market itself is not as important as the ability to influence and direct the consumption patterns of that market. Much of the PBMs' ability to achieve price concessions from manufacturers reflects their ability to influence drug consumption behavior and to potentially move market share through financial incentives involving varying cost-sharing tiers, formularies that offer the possibility that certain products will be excluded and drug management strategies including step therapy. For these reasons and others, critics claim that PBMs with large numbers of Medicare Part D enrollees would be able to negotiate discounts and produce savings at least as great as anything that the federal government could negotiate.", "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), at the request of congressional leaders, examined the effect of striking the \"noninterference\" provision and estimated that it would have a negligible effect on federal spending. Similarly, the Chief Actuary at CMS concluded that giving the Secretary the ability to directly negotiate prescription drug prices might not produce additional savings over what private plans negotiate. Both CBO and the CMS Chief Actuary determined that the price concessions extracted by the federal government might not exceed those that private plans might achieve.", "The magnitude of any discounts resulting from federal negotiation on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries would depend critically on a number of variables and would likely vary depending on the drug. As the VA's experience illustrates, larger discounts are more likely to be achieved for drugs in classes in which there are many alternatives. This is where the VA's greatest discounts are achieved. For single-source drugs, the government may still be able to obtain substantial discounts, but it may depend on what specific bargaining power is available to the Secretary. As noted above, all pharmaceutical companies have an incentive to have their products listed on the FSS because participation is tied to eligibility for Medicaid reimbursement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Drug Availability for Beneficiaries", "paragraphs": ["Proponents of a market-based, decentralized approach believe that by having a variety of organizations negotiating different prices, more choices will be available to Medicare beneficiaries and, therefore, better patient outcomes.

In this view, beneficiaries will then be able to choose the plan that best meets their individual prescription drug needs and acquire them at competitive market prices.", "One study claims that the number of drugs available under the VA formulary is more restrictive than those available from private Medicare Part D plans. The report also claims that the drugs on the VA formulary are older than drugs on formularies used by private plans.

To illustrate the importance of the VA contract and how significant industry observers consider it to be, the share values of the drug distributor AmerisourceBergen Corporation fell 11.6% and the company lowered its 2004 earnings estimate by almost 10% after losing the contract to the McKesson Corporation. The Medicare market for prescription drugs is significantly larger than the VA market, and if structured similarly, the federal contracts with the Medicare program stand to carry similar or greater impacts for the industry."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effect on Drug Prices in Other Markets", "paragraphs": ["Because of the complex relationships in drug prices across different types of buyers, the effect of changing one price, such as negotiating a discount for Medicare beneficiaries, may have indirect consequences on other prices. While drug prices paid by Medicare beneficiaries may fall in the short run, overall drug prices may increase in the long run for other consumers, specifically for the under-65 population. Under this argument, pharmaceutical companies might increase the prices they charge to other buyers in response to the lower prices negotiated by the federal government for Medicare beneficiaries. Similarly, as the \"best price\" increases, the prices for other buyers who calculate reimbursements that are referenced to the \"best prices\" would also rise, potentially affecting both VA prices and Medicaid prices.", "Finally, those who oppose government involvement in prescription drug price negotiations claim that the government would be setting prices, not negotiating. They cite the experience in other parts of the Medicare program, where provider reimbursement under Parts A and B are set by the Medicare program, and claim that the federal government would impose a similarly rigid pricing schedule on the prescription drug market. Whether this comes to pass depends on the specifics of how the legislation and subsequent regulations are written, and which approach is chosen to implement any given authority to affect drug prices on behalf or Medicare beneficiaries."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Recent Legislative Activity", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "H.R. 4", "paragraphs": ["On January 12, 2007, the House passed H.R. 4 , the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007. This bill would amend the Social Security Act by (1) striking section 1860D\u201411(i) (relating to noninterference), (2) add language that would require the Secretary of HHS to negotiate prescription drug prices, and (3) maintain the prohibition against the establishment of a formulary by the Secretary while (4) allowing prescription drug plans to obtain discounts or price reductions below those negotiated by the Secretary. The bill would also require the Secretary to submit a report \"on negotiations conducted by the Secretary to achieve lower prices for Medicare beneficiaries, and the prices and price discounts achieved by the Secretary as a result of such negotiations\" to the committees on Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, and Oversight and Government Reform of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate beginning no later than June 1, 2007, and every six months thereafter. The bill would take effect on the date of enactment and would first apply to negotiations and prices for plan years beginning on January 1, 2008.", "CBO has scored the bill as having \"a negligible effect on federal spending.\" CBO anticipates that \"the Secretary would be unable to negotiate prices across the broad range of covered Part D drugs that are more favorable than those obtained by PDPs under current law.\" Specifically, the absence of the authority to establish a formulary would limit the Secretary's ability to influence the outcome of negotiations, as bargaining leverage would be limited. CMS actuaries have also concluded that H.R. 4 would not produce lower drug prices or any additional savings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "S. 3", "paragraphs": ["On April 11, 2007, the Senate Finance Committee passed an amended version of S. 3 that repeals the noninterference provision but does not mandate that the Secretary negotiate for lower prescription drug prices. The bill also includes additional provisions to increase transparency in the Part D program by making some data available to congressional support agencies and to prioritize comparative effectiveness research on drugs.", "The bill as passed by the Finance Committee would allow data collected by the Secretary on PDPs and MA-PDs to be used by congressional support agencies (the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO; the Congressional Research Service, or CRS; the Government Accountability Office, or GAO; and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, or MedPAC) to fulfill their duties.", "Upon request, the Secretary would make available to any of the congressional support agencies aggregate data on negotiated prices including discounts, subsidies, and rebates; drug claims data; reinsurance payments paid to plans; and the adjustments of payments to plans as a result of the risk corridors established under MMA. In addition, CBO would be able to obtain non-aggregated information about negotiated rebates, discounts, and other price concessions by drug and by contract or plan. The congressional support agencies would be prohibited from disclosing the information in any manner that would result in the disclosure of trade secrets, and where the disclosure, report, or release of the information would permit the identification of a specific prescription drug plan, MA-PD plan, pharmacy benefit manager, drug manufacturer, drug wholesaler, drug, or individual enrolled in a prescription drug plan or an MA-PD plan.", "S. 3 would also require the CBO to study the effect of market competition on prices for drugs under Part D. The study would (1) examine the number and extent of discounts and other price concessions received by prescription drug plans and MA-PD plans for covered Part D drugs, (2) examine the relationship between discounts and price concessions and drug utilization, (3) compare the Medicare Part D discounts and price concessions with those obtained under the Medicaid program, and (4) examine the extent to which the efforts of the Secretary of Health and Human Services would have an effect upon payers in non-Medicare markets. A report on this study would be due a year after enactment.", "The bill would also require the Secretary to make public the data on the prices charged for each covered part D drug under each prescription drug plan and MA-PD plan to individuals enrolled in the plan. The data would reflect actual prices posted on the website of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and would be made available in a manner that permits linkage of the data to data contained in other public prescription drug plan and MA-PD plan data files.", "S. 3 would also instruct the Secretary of HHS to develop a new prioritized list of comparative clinical effectiveness studies on prescription drugs covered under Part D. The list is to reflect studies most critical to advancing value-based purchasing of covered Part D drugs. The bill would also establish an advisory committee to provide advice on setting priorities for comparative clinical effectiveness studies. The committee would include a diverse range of public and private experts, stakeholders, and interests from industry, patients and representatives of patients, researchers, and government with no group having a majority of members.", "Within one year of the enactment of the act, the Secretary would be required to submit a report to Congress that would include (1) the prioritized list of comparative clinical effectiveness studies and plans for the conduct of the studies; (2) a summary of the four factors the Secretary would be required to take into account in constructing the list; and (3) an explanation of how the Secretary took into account each of the four factors in developing the list and preparing the report. The Secretary would be required to make the report publicly available.", "Finally, S. 3 would also instruct pharmacy and therapeutic (P&T) committees to consider comparative clinical effectiveness studies in developing and reviewing formularies for Medicare prescription drug plans, if relevant. Currently, guidelines for Medicare Part D formularies require the inclusion of two drugs in each therapeutic class, except if only one drug is available, coverage of \"all or substantially all\" drugs in six protected classes. Plans can neither change their formularies without CMS approval nor drop coverage for persons currently using the drug, except at the beginning of the calendar year.", "CBO's evaluation of S. 3 is very similar to its assessment of H.R. 4 .

Without the authority to establish a formulary or other tools to reduce drug prices, we believe that the Secretary would not obtain significant discounts from drug manufacturers across a broad range of drugs.", "CBO's letter also noted that the provisions of the bill that would permit Congressional support agencies access to Part D data and establish a prioritized list of potential studies of the comparative clinical effectiveness of drugs covered under Part D \"would have no effect on direct spending.\"", "On April 18, 2007, the Senate did not invoke cloture on S. 3 .", "This report will be updated."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
