Networks that permit electronic communication among providers must be secure in order tosafeguard the information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. They also require thedevelopment of data and messaging standards to establish the critical goal of interoperability, thatis, the ability of two or more IT systems (computers, networks, software, and other IT components)to communicate with one another and make sense of the data they exchange. A small but growingnumber of communities and health care systems around the country have developed EHRs andestablished secure platforms for the exchange of health data among providers, patients, and otherauthorized users (e.g., the Veterans Health Administration, the Indiana Network for Patient Care,the Santa Barbara County Care Data Exchange, and the New England Healthcare Electronic DataInterchange Network).", "The IOM's March 2001 report on health care quality, Crossing the Quality Chasm: A NewHealth Care System for the 21st Century, emphasized the need for improvement in six key areas: safety, effectiveness, responsiveness to patients, timeliness, efficiency, and equity. A growingnumber of published studies suggest that IT can play a key role in improving the quality of care ineach of these areas. In the area of safety, CPOE systems with decision support functions can reduceerrors in drug prescribing and dosing. Clinical decision support systems have been shown toimprove efficiency, for example, by reducing redundant lab tests. They can also improve theeffectiveness of care by promoting compliance with clinical practice guidelines. Health IT may beespecially beneficial for inner-city and rural populations and other medically underserved areas. Real-time access to specialty information, including consultations between rural physicians andleading specialists at academic medical centers, helps promote an equitable health care system byreducing the geographic variability in access to the best quality care. The secure transmission ofpatient information among physicians will significantly improve the coordination of care among the60 million Americans with multiple chronic conditions. Studies have shown that poor coordinationof care among Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions leads to unnecessaryhospitalization, duplicate tests, conflicting clinical advice, and adverse drug reactions as a result ofover-medication.", "An IT infrastructure has great potential to contribute to achieving other important nationalobjectives, such as homeland security and improved public health services. Linked healthinformation networks are key to reducing the time it takes to detect and respond to disease outbreaks,whether they are naturally occurring or the result of a bioterrorist attack. They are also an importanttool for helping organize and execute large-scale vaccination campaigns and for monitoring thehealth of the population. Finally, health IT is becoming increasingly important for various forms ofbiomedical and health services research, and for translating research findings into clinical practicemore quickly. By some estimates it may take as long as 17 years for new research findings to befully integrated into general medical practice.

Physicians and other providers are hesitant to invest in IT systems, fearing that they mightnot be able to exchange patient information with local pharmacies, hospitals, or even otherphysicians. Common standards for organizing, representing, and encoding health information permitthe efficient exchange of clinical and patient safety data. They also support the assimilation ofexternal data sources into decision support tools for providers (e.g., alerts for possible drug-druginteractions).", "The federal government is playing a leading role in encouraging the development andadoption of interoperability standards for health information throughout the U.S. health care system. The Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Defense (DOD), and Veterans Affairs (VA)are partners in the Consolidated Health Informatics (CHI) initiative, one of 24 eGov initiatives tosupport President Bush's Management Agenda. The goal of the CHI initiative is to establish federalhealth information interoperability standards both to promote information sharing across the threefederal departments that deliver health care services and to serve as a model for the private sector. To date, the agencies have adopted 20 sets of standards developed by private-sector StandardsDevelopment Organizations (SDOs). They include messaging standards, standards for the electronicexchange of clinical lab results, standards for retail pharmacy transactions, and standards for theretrieval and transfer of images and associated diagnostic information. HHS has also signed anagreement to license Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -- Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT),a standardized medical vocabulary developed by the College of American Pathologists and availablefor free to users in the United States. SNOMED CT, which is now available through the NationalLibrary of Medicine, (4) isthe most comprehensive clinical vocabulary available and covers most aspects of clinical medicine. It will help structure and computerize the medical record and reduce variability in the way the dataare captured, encoded and used for clinical care of patients and for medical research.", "In May 2003, HHS requested that the IOM provide guidance to the agency on a set of basic\"functionalities\" that an EHR should possess, that is, the types of information that should beavailable to providers when making clinical decisions (e.g., diagnoses, allergies, lab results), and thetypes of decision-support capabilities that should be present (e.g., alerts to potential drug-druginteractions).\" The IOM did not address specific data standards (e.g., terminology, messagingstandards, diagnostic codes). Health Level Seven (HL7), a leading SDO working on thedevelopment of an EHR standard, has taken the core functionalities identified by the IOM andincorporated them into its draft standard, which has been approved and is undergoing a two-year trialbefore it becomes an official standard. (5) ", "Coordinating the care a patient receives from multiple providers does not require thetransmission of the entire EHR with each referral. In most cases the physician to whom a patient isreferred needs only the most relevant and timely facts about the patient's condition. ASTMInternational, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Medical Society, the Health InformationManagement and Systems Society, and the American Academy of Family Physicians, is developingthe Continuity of Care Record (CCR) to meet that need. The CCR is intended to be a nationalstandard for all relevant information necessary for continuity of care. It consists of a minimum dataset that includes provider information, insurance information, patient's health status (e.g., allergies,medications, vital signs, diagnoses, recent procedures), recent care provided, as well asrecommendations for future care and reasons for referral or transfer. The data contained within theCCR are a subset of the patient's full record that exists in an EHR. Each new provider that sees thepatient is able to access the CCR and update the information as necessary. Thus the CCR providesa vehicle for exchanging clinical information among providers, institutions, or other entities. It mayalso be used by the patient as a brief summary of recent care.

HIPAA instructed the HHS Secretary to issue electronic format and data standardsfor several routine administrative transactions between health care providers and health plans (e.g.,reimbursement claims) and adopt security standards to safeguard electronic patient informationagainst unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Developing a secure platform to protect confidentialhealth data is central to the growth of an NHII. Under HIPAA, HHS has also issued health privacystandards that give individuals the right of access to their medical information and prohibit plans andproviders from using or disclosing such information without the patient's authorization, except forroutine health care operations and other specified purposes.

A full clinical IT system that includes CPOE and an EHR, coupled with clinical decisionsupport functions, can cost tens of millions of dollars for a large hospital. And that does not includethe costs of training and systems support.", "The start-up and maintenance costs of IT systems may be especially burdensome for smallphysician practices. While those costs vary tremendously, depending on the nature of the practiceand the applications involved, the average cost of an EHR can range from $16,000 to $36,000. Thecomplexity of the technology, the time to complete implementation, and the changes in officeworkflow patterns create additional barriers to adopting IT systems. But perhaps the most criticalissue for physicians is the perception that the IT-related benefits of improved efficiency and qualityof care accrue largely to the payers and patients, not to the providers who bear most of theimplementation costs.", "Rather than reward quality, most physician reimbursement systems emphasize volume ofservices. Physicians are paid for each procedure or service they provide, regardless of its quality. This approach encourages providers to see as many patients as possible and to emphasize theprovision of a billable service, such as an MRI, over technology that might improve the quality ofmany services. A physician group that invests in a clinical IT system to improve the way it managesthe care of patients with chronic conditions can reduce the number of complications and thehospitalization rate. But unless the change results in additional office visits, only the payer sees afinancial benefit. One potential solution to this problem is to provide direct payments to physicianswho use IT systems.
