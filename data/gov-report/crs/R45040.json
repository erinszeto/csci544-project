The burden of proof is on the applicant to establish eligibility for nonimmigrant status and the type of nonimmigrant visa for which the application is made. Both DOS consular officers (when the alien is applying for nonimmigrant status abroad) and DHS inspectors (when the alien is entering the United States) must also determine that the alien is not ineligible for a visa under the INA's \"grounds for inadmissibility,\" which include criminal, terrorist, and public health grounds for exclusion.", "In FY2016, DOS consular officers issued 10.4 million nonimmigrant visas, down from a peak of 10.9 million in FY2015.

Other notable groups were temporary workers (883,000, or 8.5%), students (513,000, or 4.9%), and cultural exchange visitors (380,000, or 3.7%). Visas issued to foreign nationals from Asia made up 45% of nonimmigrant visas issued in FY2016, followed by North America (20%), South America (17%), Europe (11%), and Africa (5%).", "U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) inspectors approved 181.3 million temporary admissions of foreign nationals to the United States during FY2016.

In FY2015, California and Florida were the top two destination states for nonimmigrant visa holders, with each state being listed as the destination for more than 10 million nonimmigrant admissions. In addition, 10 other states and the territory of Guam were listed as the destination for more than 1 million nonimmigrant admissions each in that year.", "Current law and regulations set terms for nonimmigrant lengths of stay in the United States, typically include foreign residency requirements, and often limit what aliens are permitted to do while in the country (e.g., engage in employment or enroll in school).

Tourists, business visitors, and foreign students, for example, are usually seen as a boon to the U.S. economy, while the economic costs and benefits of temporary workers are hotly debated. In addition, cultural exchange programs are a foreign policy tool, intended to foster democratic principles and spread American values across the globe, but some of these programs that include work authorization have come under scrutiny for an alleged lack of protections for both U.S. workers and program participants. Further, the entry of nonimmigrants has prompted national security concerns\u2014particularly over those who enter under the Visa Waiver Program. Debates also continue over the implementation of a system to document the exits of foreign nationals from the United States, as nonimmigrants who remain in the country after their visas expire are accounting for a growing share of the unauthorized alien population.

Although foreign nationals from Asia held 45.9% of visas issued in FY2015, they comprised 18.3%, or 14 million, of I-94 admissions . This could be due in part to the fact that only five Asian countries are designated in the VWP, along with the lower likelihood of repeat entries from Asia given its distance from the United States.

The adjusters may have entered the country in various capacities, including as refugees, asylees, parolees, nonimmigrants, or illegal entrants.", "As discussed earlier, most foreign nationals seeking to qualify for a nonimmigrant visa must demonstrate that they are not coming to the United States to reside permanently. By statute, three nonimmigrant visas permit the visa holder to simultaneously seek LPR status, also known as \"dual intent\": H-1 professional workers, L intracompany transfers, and V accompanying family members.", "The connections between the temporary and permanent immigration systems affect both employment- and family-based immigration, the two main mechanisms for permanent immigration. While about half (51.6%) of all individuals receiving LPR status in FY2015 adjusted from another status (versus new arrivals), a larger share (84.7%) of those receiving employment-based LPR status were adjusting from another status. Presumably, many of these individuals were previously H-1B and L visa holders, both of which allow for immigrant intent.

Some policymakers consider this a natural and positive chain of events, arguing that it would be foolish to educate nonimmigrants only to make them leave the country to work for foreign competitors. To that end, there have been legislative proposals to allow aliens who have earned a Ph.D. in a STEM field from a U.S. university to be exempt from numerical limits on H-1Bs and employment-based green cards. Others consider this \"F-1 to H-1B to LPR\" pathway an abuse of the temporary element of nonimmigrant status and a way to circumvent the laws and procedures that protect U.S. workers from being displaced by immigrants. To that end, other proposals would prevent foreign students from gaining U.S. employment through the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program.

According to the 2017 report, which accounted for 50.4 million nonimmigrants who entered the United States through an air or sea port and were expected to depart in FY2016, an estimated 1.47% (or 739,478 individuals) were overstays. This number includes individuals who left the country after their visa expired and those who were suspected to still be in the United States.", "Given the historical lack of nonimmigrant departure data, immigration scholars have used estimation techniques to study the number and characteristics of the overstay population (and the population of unauthorized aliens writ large). Recent reports from the Center for Migration Studies found that, in each year from 2007 to 2014, the number of aliens becoming unauthorized by overstaying a nonimmigrant visa was higher than the number who did so by entering the country without inspection (EWI). This is mainly a result of the sharp decline in the number of EWIs since the early 2000s. Of the 11 million unauthorized aliens estimated to be living in the United States in 2014, 42% (4.5 million) were estimated to have arrived in the country legally and overstayed a visa.
