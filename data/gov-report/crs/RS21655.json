During the 1980s, El Salvador was the largest recipient of U.S. aid in Latin America as its government struggled against the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) insurgency during a 12-year civil war. A peace accord negotiated in 1992 brought the war to an end and formally assimilated the FMLN into the political process as a political party. After the peace accords were signed, U.S. involvement shifted toward helping successive Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) governments rebuild democracy and implement market-friendly economic reforms.", "Funes Administration", "Twenty-one years after the signing of the peace accords, El Salvador is governed by an FMLN Administration.

President Funes has generally pursued moderate policies that have enabled him to form cross-party coalitions in the National Assembly, but caused periodic friction with more radical members of his party.", "Now in his fourth year in office, President Funes still has high approval ratings, but faces a number of serious challenges. His political influence has weakened since ARENA replaced the FMLN as the largest party in the legislature and the attention of both parties has turned to the 2014 presidential contest, which President Funes is constitutionally barred from contesting. Nevertheless, Funes successfully mediated a resolution to a months-long standoff between the Salvadoran judiciary and legislature over the composition and power of the Supreme Court in August 2012. In the economic realm, the Funes Administration is seeking to boost investment and growth, which has been inhibited by low productivity, natural disasters, and insecurity. In an attempt to address insecurity in the country, the Funes government endorsed a historic\u2014and risky\u2014truce involving the country's largest gangs.

Congress has provided bilateral assistance, which totaled $28.2 million in FY2012, as well as aid provided through the Central American Regional Security Initiative (CARSI), in support of PFG priorities. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) recently completed a five-year, $461 million program that helped develop El Salvador's northern border region. MCC has determined that El Salvador is eligible to submit a second compact proposal to develop its southern coastal region.

Funes, a former television journalist and the first FMLN presidential candidate without a guerilla past, defeated Rodrigo \u00c1vila of the conservative Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) 51%-49% in a March 2009 election. Born in San Salvador in 1959, Funes earned a liberal arts degree from the University of Central America (UCA) Jos\u00e9 Sime\u00f3n Ca\u00f1as. He then spent more than 20 years working as a print, radio, and television journalist, becoming one of the most popular and well-respected figures in his field. In 2007, he was chosen to serve as the FMLN's 2009 presidential candidate, reportedly because party leaders thought that he would bring a modern face to the party. ", "Despite some concerns about potential fraud and a few cases of inter-party violence in the weeks preceding the vote, the election was conducted relatively peacefully after an extremely polarizing campaign. During the campaign, ARENA sought to tie Funes to the more hard-line members of the FMLN and asserted that an FMLN victory would lead to deterioration in relations with the United States and the installation of an authoritarian political system. Funes attempted to project a moderate image, campaigning on the slogan, \"hope is born, change is coming,\" but also promising to maintain close ties with the United States, implement the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), and keep the U.S. dollar as El Salvador's currency. ", "Funes' presidential victory was a first for the FMLN, which fought a 12-year civil war against the U.S.-backed Salvadoran government before officially transforming into a political party following the signing of a peace accord in 1992. Some 70,000 Salvadorans (1.4% of the population) were killed during the conflict. The presidential victory followed a strong showing by the FMLN in the January 2009 municipal and legislative elections, in which it won 49.5% of the municipal vote and a plurality in the National Assembly. Funes' election has been described as a watershed moment in the history of El Salvador. However, an analysis of Salvadoran voting behavior since 1992 concluded that Funes' victory occurred at least partially as a result of a gradual shift leftward among Salvadoran voters that was already evident by early 2008.

This has caused some friction between him and more radical members of the FMLN, including Vice President Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n, a former guerrilla leader who is the party's 2014 presidential candidate. Many credit President Funes' pragmatic approach to governance with helping his administration secure much-needed support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other donors. Others express concerns, however, that he has strayed too far away from his FMLN base since forming an alliance with the Grand Alliance for National Unity (GANA) party, a dissident faction that split from ARENA in October 2009 that is led by former president El\u00edas Antonio (Tony) Saca. Although his government has struggled to improve the weak economic conditions and to address the serious security challenges it inherited, President Funes has maintained high approval ratings (75% in March 2013).", "Funes has also sought to address human rights violations from El Salvador's civil war era. He issued a historic apology to victims of the 1981 El Mozote massacre on the 20 th anniversary of the signing of the Peace Accords. In December 2012, the Funes government \"recognized\" the Inter American Court of Human Rights (IAHCR) ruling that El Salvador needs to reinvestigate the El Mozote massacre and guarantee the rights of victims to seek reparations. The government stopped short, however, of promising to reinvestigate the incident and prosecute those found accountable, which would require a repeal of the country's 1993 amnesty law. The Funes government has not pushed for a repeal of the law nor did it urge the Salvadoran Supreme Court to extradite military officers to Spain to stand trial for their roles in the 1989 murders of Jesuit priests. Twenty years after the U.N. Commission released its report on the war in El Salvador , Amnesty International issued a statement lamenting that the perpetrators of crimes identified in that report have not been brought to justice in El Salvador and that survivors have not received reparations. However, some former military leaders residing in the United States are facing judicial proceedings that could lead to their arrests and/or removals from the country.", "Analysts predict that President Funes will encounter greater difficulty enacting his legislative agenda and implementing his ambitious development plan now that he has entered lame duck status. ARENA regained popular support vis-\u00e0-vis GANA and the National Coalition party or CN, which replaced the National Conciliation Party (PCN), in the March 2012 legislative elections, increasing its representation in the 84-member legislature from 20 to 33. The FMLN lost 4 seats in the elections; it now has 31 congressional seats. Since the elections, however, ARENA has reportedly had five deputies leave the party.", "With no party having captured a simple majority, President Funes must form alliances to pass legislation. Funes has pledged to shepherd a law to allow seizure of criminal assets and a package of reforms aimed at facilitating business creation and investment through the legislature. He secured legislative approval of an $800 million bond issue in the fall of 2012 that will be used to pay for foreign debt payments that came due in early 2013. After a protracted dispute between the parties in the Assembly, they finally selected a new attorney general in December 2012 (the post had been vacant since September 2012). In January 2013, the Assembly passed a law backed by President Funes to revise existing legislation regulating free trade zones and international services to attract more foreign investment. A law to promote public-private partnerships remains pending. The IMF has urged the parties to enact agreements on economic and political policies that will be put in place as the country transitions to a new government in 2014 if they want El Salvador's stand-by-agreement to be renewed.

The court is comprised of 15 justices that are divided among four chambers, including a constitutional chamber. Five justices are appointed to the Court every three years by a two-thirds vote in the National Assembly after often highly politicized negotiations. They serve for nine-year terms. Following the 2009 elections, the Assembly approved five new justices after difficult negotiations.", "Since their installation in 2009, the five justices on the constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court have taken actions which appeared intended to check the power of the president and the legislature, something it has historically failed to do. These rulings have allowed independent candidates to run for office, limited the use of the discretionary budget of the presidency, and revoked the charters of two political parties for not maintaining the level of popular support required by the constitution. These rulings angered politicians from across the political spectrum and have led to threats to the independence of the court. In June 2011, for example, President Funes hastily signed a decree adopted by the National Assembly that would have constrained the independence of the justices on the constitutional chamber. The decree was repealed in July 2011 after protests from domestic and international civil society groups. Although the repeal reaffirmed the independence of the court, tensions between the three branches of government still simmered beneath the surface.", "As noted above, the ARENA party picked up a number of seats and displaced the FMLN as the largest party in the Assembly in March 2012 legislative elections. In April, before the outgoing Assembly's three-year term ended, FMLN deputies and their GANA allies approved a new set of five justices for the Supreme Court in an attempt to influence the court's direction (as ARENA-dominated legislatures had done in the past). They also sought to transfer the head of the constitutional chamber to another chamber of the court and appointed a new attorney general. ", "In June 2012, the constitutional chamber ruled that the vaguely worded Salvadoran constitution only allows each legislature to nominate one group of five justices to the Supreme Court. As a result, the National Assembly's April 2012 appointments were deemed unconstitutional, as the outgoing legislature had already appointed one group of justices in 2009. A similar situation took place in an earlier Assembly when five justices were appointed at the beginning of 2003 and a second group in 2006 at the end of that Assembly's term. The chamber found the 2006 appointments to be unconstitutional as well, and ruled that both the 2006 and 2012 appointees had to be replaced. ", "The chamber's decision prompted ongoing tensions between the legislature and the constitutional chamber to erupt into a full-blown crisis. The Assembly rejected the court ruling and filed a lawsuit against the constitutional chamber with the Central American Court of Justice (CACJ), a body that many legal experts maintained did not have the authority to overturn a Supreme Court decision of one of its member states. The newly elected justices then forcibly entered the court building to take their seats on July 1, despite protests from the constitutional chamber. El Salvador then had two groups of judges claiming to be on the Supreme Court.", "On July 10, 2012, the constitutional chamber also declared the outgoing legislature's April 2012 selection of a new attorney general, originally scheduled to assume his position in September, to be unconstitutional. The justices again argued that each legislature is only entitled to select one attorney general. The legislature also rejected that ruling.", "Pressure from the United Nations, the United States, and others may have prompted President Funes, who had previously avoided intervening directly in the crisis, to call all parties together in late July to hammer out a compromise that respects the Salvadoran constitution. Obama Administration officials expressed confidence that the crisis could be resolved in a manner that respects the Salvadoran constitution without U.S. intervention. In contrast, some Members of the U.S. Congress threatened to suspend certain U.S. assistance if a constitutionally sound solution was not reached soon. ", "The resolution, negotiated by party leaders in 17 sessions led by President Funes and then approved by the National Assembly on August 20, involved the reelection of the same judges whom the constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court had ruled were elected unconstitutionally in 2006 and in April 2012. The resolution also replaced the judge originally selected to be president of the court and head of the constitutional chamber with another one of the 2012 class of judges with less overt ties to the FMLN. Most political and civic leaders have expressed relief that the resolution, albeit imperfect, respected the constitutional chambers' rulings. ", "The resolution to the constitutional crisis did not address the constitutional court's July ruling that the outgoing Assembly's selection of a new attorney general in April 2012 was unconstitutional. Legislators agreed to hold another vote to fill the post, but that vote did not occur until December 2012 after months of pressure for the parties to compromise coming from President Funes and other actors, including the U.N. Rapporteur for the Independence of Judges and Lawyers.", "In January 2013, the constitutional chamber ruled that the process by which the National Assembly has appointed judges to the Court of Auditors, which oversees the government's finances, is unconstitutional. Rather than appointing people who are both competent and independent, as required by the constitution, the Assembly has traditionally chosen people aligned with political parties. In mid-March, the Assembly re-did the appointments, again appointing people with party affiliations, which the constitutional chamber again rejected.", "These repeated political crises have negatively impacted the political climate in El Salvador.

According to the Civilian National Police (PNC), El Salvador recorded a murder rate of 69 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2011, one of the highest in the world. Drug trafficking, corruption, and a proliferation of illicit firearms, coupled with high levels of poverty, inequality, and unemployment, have contributed to the current situation. Drug trafficking organizations (DTOs), including Salvadoran groups such as the Texis Cartel, and Mexican groups such as Los Zetas, have increased their illicit activities in the country, including money laundering. Some analysts assert that connections between DTOs (national and transnational) and the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) gang are fairly well developed. Between 20,000 and 35,000 Salvadoran youth belong to maras (street gangs), which former PNC officials had maintained were responsible for half of all homicides and a majority of extortion in the country. Deteriorating security conditions prompted President Funes to replace his FMLN minister of public security with retired general and former defense minister David Mungu\u00eda Pay\u00e9s in November 2011. Mungu\u00eda Pay\u00e9s has said that there could be 50,000 gang members in El Salvador and that up to 90% of homicides in the country are attributable to gangs or drug trafficking, estimates that may be somewhat inflated.

With almost 90% of the PNC budget devoted to salaries and benefits for current officers, there has historically been limited funding available for investing in training and equipment. According to the PNC's strategic plan for 2009-2014, the challenges it needs to overcome include \"a lack of incentives and a career path for officers, deficient training and infrastructure, and a lack of intelligence capabilities, among others.\" Corruption, weak investigatory capacity, and an inability to prosecute officers accused of corruption and human rights abuses remain additional barriers to improved police performance. ", "The PNC is currently being restructured. Minister Mungu\u00eda Pay\u00e9s and the new PNC director, also a retired general, have removed most officers affiliated with the FMLN from leadership positions. Human rights groups maintain that Funes' appointment of retired generals to lead the public security ministry and civilian national police violates the Peace Accords and the constitution; the constitutional chamber may rule on that matter. Analysts have also expressed concerns that some of the officers appointed to key positions had been under investigation by the Inspector General of the PNC for ties to organized crime. The arrest and hasty release of Jos\u00e9 Natividad Luna Pereira (\"Chepe Luna\"), a fugitive Salvadoran drug trafficker, in Honduras in August 2012 refocused scrutiny on Salvadoran police officers who had been under investigation for allegedly helping Luna (of Los Perrones drug trafficking organization) evade capture in the past. Minister Mungu\u00eda Pay\u00e9s reportedly dismissed ties between Chepe Luna and the PNC officers as \"speculation\" and the cases against them were closed by the newly appointed PNC Inspector General in September. Another high profile trafficker, Jorge Ernesto Ulloa Sibrian, who reportedly previously enjoyed police protection, has just been arrested in Guatemala.", "As in neighboring Guatemala and Honduras, funding and manpower deficiencies within the PNC have led President Funes to task Salvadoran military forces with carrying out a variety of public security functions. In November 2009, President Funes issued an emergency decree, which has been repeatedly extended, deploying military troops to assist police forces in fighting crime on the streets until enough police can be recruited, trained, and equipped to handle the task alone. Thousands of troops are now involved in securing border crossings, carrying out joint patrols with police in high-crime areas, and securing prisons. While the military is generally more well-respected in El Salvador than the police, it only has about 14,000 troops, and its 2011 budget was much lower than that of the PNC ($124 million as compared to $233 million). The military, like the police, has been accused of involvement in extrajudicial killings and torture.", "In addition to problems within the PNC, the State Department maintains that \"inefficiency, corruption, political infighting, and insufficient resources\" have hindered the performance of the Salvadoran judiciary. As Salvadoran police and prosecutors are often loathe to work together to build cases, few arrests lead to successful prosecutions. El Salvador's current criminal conviction rate is just 5%.

In March 2012, Minister Mungu\u00eda Pay\u00e9s agreed to transfer high-ranking gang leaders to less secure prisons in order to facilitate negotiations for a truce between the gangs. Questions remain surrounding what exactly was negotiated with the gangs, when, and under what circumstances. Until very recently, Minister Mungu\u00eda Pay\u00e9s had denied his role in facilitating the truce.

Gang leaders have pledged not to forcibly recruit children into their ranks or perpetrate violence against women, turned in small amounts of weapons, and offered to engage in broader negotiations that could potentially result in a permanent truce. They did not agree to give up control of over their territories. Gang negotiators have said that improving prison conditions and providing more rehabilitation and reintegration programs for gang members will be crucial to maintaining the truce. They hope to obtain donor support for those efforts. The Organization of American States (OAS) has begun monitoring the implementation of the truce and trying to build support for the nascent peace process from civil society, the private sector, and politicians, among others.", "In November 2012, gang negotiators proposed the establishment of \"peace zones\" in municipalities across the country where gangs would stop all crimes in exchange for being able to participate in reinsertion programs. By January 2013, the first five municipalities participating in the \"peace zone\" plan had been announced, some governed by the FMLN and some by ARENA party. As many as 60 municipalities may want to participate. The government of El Salvador has reportedly said that municipalities that participate in the effort will receive investments from a fund of some $72 million, although it is as yet unclear where that money will come from. A charitable foundation has been established to coordinate international efforts to support the truce, including the \"peace zone\" plan. While some have praised the effort, others have expressed doubts about the gangs' commitment to ending all crimes (including extortion), and the government's ability to ensure that the \"peace zones\" do not become havens for lawlessness.", "Many, including OAS Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza, have praised the truce for reducing the homicide rate in El Salvador and effectively saving the lives of thousands of young people. The coordinator of U.N. programs in El Salvador has said that the truce presents a unique window of opportunity for the country to find a long-term, integral solution to violence and criminality. U.S.-based gang experts have formed a Transitional Advisory Group in Support of the Peace Process in El Salvador, while U.S. human rights groups have lent their support to the truce insofar as it provides an opportunity to increase prevention and rehabilitation programs. ", "The truce is not without its skeptics. Some skeptics have questioned the lack of transparency and changing narrative regarding the government's role in facilitating the truce. Still others point out that while gang-on-gang homicides have declined, the level of extortion and other violent crimes has remained high. Disappearances and the discovery of clandestine graves also continued in 2012. Apart from that, some analysts maintain that recognizing the gangs as legitimate political actors and continuing to accede to their demands carries enormous risks for the Salvadoran government. For example, should the negotiations collapse, the gangs could emerge even more powerful and organized after taking advantage of less restrictive prison conditions. Skeptics are particularly concerned about the prospects for a loss of government control over security and the rule of law in areas deemed as \"safe zones.\"", "U.S. officials have made few public comments about the truce; in August 2012, U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador, Mari Carmen Aponte reportedly said that the truce had reduced crime, but that policies must \"address the root causes [of crime] in order to be effective and for any reduction [in crime] to be sustainable.\" While some believe the Treasury Department's decision to sanction the financial activities of the MS-13 may signify U.S. skepticism of the truce, Ambassador Aponte has said that the decision responded to the activities of the gang in the United States and was made totally independent of the truce. (See \" Anti-Gang Efforts and the Designation of the MS-13 as a Major Transnational Criminal Organization \" below.) A State Department Travel Warning for El Salvador issued on January 23, 2012, stated that the truce \"contributed to a decline in the homicide rate \u2026 [but] the sustainability of the decline is unclear, and the truce [has] had little impact on robbery, assaults, and other violent crimes.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prevention and Rehabilitation Efforts", "paragraphs": ["In recent months, the Funes government has expanded prevention and rehabilitation programs, both as part of its commitments under the Partnership for Growth and in order to support the nascent gang truce.

After posting strong growth rates in the 1990s, El Salvador's more moderate growth rates in the 2000s were not high enough to improve living standards among the Salvadoran people, approximately 47% of whom continued to live in poverty in 2010 (slightly lower than in 2001). Emigration reduced rural unemployment and infused some households with extra income in the form of remittances, but has also caused significant social disruptions.", "The Funes government is still struggling to boost El Salvador's economy, which contracted by 3.1% in 2009, largely as a result of the impact of the global financial crisis and U.S. recession. Since the United States is El Salvador's most important trade and investment partner, the U.S. economic slowdown caused remittances, investment, tourism revenues, and demand for Salvadoran exports to decline. Upon taking office, President Funes called for austerity, emphasizing the need to reduce excess spending, better target subsidies, and combat tax evasion and corruption. He also announced an \"Anti-Crisis\" plan focused on boosting social spending, constructing new housing, and improving public utilities and road infrastructure. In November 2009, Funes' efforts to repair the Salvadoran economy were dealt a significant blow when Hurricane Ida and related flooding caused 198 deaths and inflicted millions of dollars in damages to agriculture and infrastructure in the country. In March 2010, President Funes and the IMF agreed to a $790 million package premised on the idea that as the Salvadoran economy recovers, the government will strive to improve tax administration, restrict spending, and reallocate energy subsidies. The IMF agreement paved the way for loans totaling $600 million from the World Bank and $450 million from the Inter-American Development Bank. Those loans are supporting anti-poverty efforts, fiscal reform programs, and the creation of an export guarantee fund.", "Despite government efforts and support from international donors, the Salvadoran economy has continued to perform poorly as compared to its Central American neighbors. El Salvador posted modest growth in 2010 (1.4%), but hopes that the economy would expand more rapidly in 2011 were dashed after flooding from Tropical Depression 12E caused some $840 million in damage to roads, infrastructure, and agriculture. GDP growth stood at 1.5% in 2011. The National Assembly's December 2011 enactment of a Funes-backed tax reform package is generating $150 million in new revenue, but the government is still struggling to reduce its fiscal deficit.

As depicted in Figure 2 , over the past decade or so, foreign direct investment (FDI) in El Salvador has lagged behind other Central American countries and the Dominican Republic. The lack of foreign investment in El Salvador has been attributed to a number of factors, including the country's difficult business climate, public security challenges, and low-skilled labor force that is too expensive to compete with other low-cost producers. After consultations with the private sector, the Funes Administration is seeking to improve the country's legal and regulatory environment, combat extortion and other crimes that affect businesses, and align job training and education programs with private sector demands. Funes is also seeking to boost public-private partnerships. Experts have recommended that El Salvador channel any increases in FDI into higher value-added production so as to take better advantage of the preferential access to the U.S. market afforded by CAFTA-DR.

During his inauguration, which was attended by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Funes asserted his desire to \"broaden, strengthen, and renew\" El Salvador's relations with the United States. While some FMLN officials have made anti-American remarks, Funes has repeatedly referred to the United States as a strategic partner. High-level contacts between Funes and Obama Administration officials culminated in President Funes' first visit to the White House, which took place on March 8, 2010. After that meeting, President Obama thanked President Funes for his help in resolving the political crisis in Honduras and expressed \"how interested the United States is in continuing to be an equal partner with El Salvador.\"", "In 2011, President Obama highlighted the importance of U.S.-Salvadoran relations by selecting El Salvador as the only Central American country to be included in his March 2011 tour of Latin America. During a March 22, 2011, joint press conference with President Funes, President Obama pledged to continue \"working as partners, with El Salvador in the lead, to confront the hurdles to growth and development.\" He announced a number of initiatives, including the Partnership for Growth (PFG); the Crossroads Fund for border infrastructure projects; and the Central American Citizen Security Partnership. The Salvadoran government has reciprocated by, for example, sending a small contingent of non-combatant troops to Afghanistan in August 2011 and agreeing to accept detainees who had been held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, in April 2012. ", "U.S.-Salvadoran cooperation has continued since that time despite tension that arose during the aforementioned constitutional crisis. U.S.-Salvadoran efforts and U.S. assistance have gradually been reoriented to focus on implementing the goals of the PFG initiative: improving productivity and reducing insecurity in El Salvador. Bilateral relations received a boost in mid-June 2012 when the U.S. Senate approved the long-stalled nomination of Mari Carmen Aponte to serve as U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador. In September 2012, both governments celebrated the completion of El Salvador's first MCC compact; a second compact proposal is currently being developed by the Salvadoran government.
