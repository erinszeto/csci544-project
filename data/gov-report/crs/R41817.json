Today, although this mission has not been completely relegated to conventional forces, the National Security Strategies of the current and previous administrations direct the U.S. military services (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines) to organize, train, and equip themselves to carry out these activities on a larger scale with conventional (non-SOF) forces. This responsibility in its broad sense of building the capacity of partner states has been termed \"security force assistance\" (SFA).", "SFA ties into several interests of Congress, including security assistance, security cooperation, foreign military financing, foreign military sales, foreign affairs, foreign aid, overseas contingency operations, and legislative authorities associated with training foreign forces (Foreign Assistance Act, P.L. 87-195; 22 U.S.C. 2151).", "Of significant interest to Congress in the near term is the ability of U.S. military forces to train their counterparts in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Obama Administration position, endorsed for the most part by Congress, is that developing competent forces in these countries is pivotal to coalition mission success and to protecting U.S. national interests. SFA is part of the U.S. strategic goal of having Iraq and Afghanistan responsible for their own security. Congress has supported the Department of Defense's agenda for training Afghani forces; however, some Members are skeptical of the new Iraqi government's commitment to developing its own security forces.", "Each of the military services has undertaken to organize, train, and equip themselves for SFA. However, while SOF have units specifically dedicated to a long-term role in SFA, the conventional forces services do not. Each of the services does have Security Cooperation and Security Assistance organizations that are dedicated to SFA activities, although they do not have SFA in their titles. The services also standardize training for deploying forces to support combatant commanders in their SFA mission. This effort to \"train the trainers,\" although an object of consistent inquiry in congressional hearings, has been endorsed in testimony by combatant commanders.", "Along with its role in the current Afghanistan and Iraq wars, SFA is directly linked to counterterrorism strategy and is key to engaging underdeveloped and undergoverned nations (often referred to as \"weak or fragile states\") in a preventive national security strategy. Regional combatant commanders apply this preventive strategy through authorities provided in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The SFA authorizations in the NDAA are often criticized as being disjointed and cumbersome, creating significant challenges to effective SFA employment. The Departments of Defense and State have presented a proposal for pooled funding to alleviate some of these challenges. The proposed Global Security Contingency Fund would be a shared resource requiring authorization by both departments. This would be similar to the temporary authorization known as \"1206 global train and equip\" authorization.", "The training, organizing, and equipping of U.S. forces to conduct SFA competes for scarce fiscal and personnel resources among the services. Some critics of SFA attest that committing to this capability within the services detracts from their ability to conduct traditional combat roles. Others suggest that building the security capacity of weak and failed states is a misguided effort.", "This report provides the following elements:", "An overview of the SFA rationale, focused primarily on Department of Defense support for and relations with foreign security forces.

Through SFA, foreign forces are trained to operate across the spectrum of conflict\u2014combating internal threats such as insurgency, subversion, and lawlessness, defending against external threats, or serving as coalition partners/peacekeepers in other areas (see Figure 1 ).

This is articulated to the regional combatant commanders, who, in turn, develop theater-specific security cooperation plans. Included in these plans are \"critical partners,\" a select group of countries or organizations that directly receive U.S. security cooperation resources because their collaboration or assistance is essential to achieving regional or functional objectives.

Simultaneously, allied troops were training Chinese and French North African forces. After the war, the Marshall Plan included establishing a West German professional military. Economic, equipment, training, and advisory support was provided to Greece and Turkey to help stabilize their governments.

Efforts to train, advise, and equip foreign forces shifted toward Vietnam and Latin America in the 1950s and 1960s. It was during this time that the special operations community was given primary responsibility for conducting the training portion of the mission. Eventually, arms transfers, economic aid, and collective security began to merge under a program known as \"security assistance.\" Following Vietnam, the United States shifted to a policy of assisting friendly nations, but requiring them to provide the manpower and be ultimately responsible for their own national defense. Such was the case with Lebanon and Panama in the 1980s.", "Security force assistance played a part in the first Iraq war. U.S. Special Forces teams worked with the Saudi military to train them on the effective and efficient use of modern weaponry and in other technical areas.

Here terrorist organizations such as the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), Jemaah Islamiyah, and Abu Sayyaf have sought refuge and sanctuary for their operations in an area of the country where the military and the government have little or limited capability. (See CRS Report RL34194, Terrorism in Southeast Asia , coordinated by [author name scrubbed], and CRS Report RL33233, The Republic of the Philippines and U.S. Interests , by [author name scrubbed].", "Also, supporters of SFA argue that the security condition of a destitute populace, disconnected from their subpar security apparatus or government in weak and failing states, could easily evolve into regional security threats. The application of SFA through \"the indirect approach\" is meant to \"to prevent festering problems from turning into crises that require costly and controversial direct military intervention.\" Some analysts have gone so far as to say that the conditions in weak and failing states pose \"the single most critical threat to US national security.\" The inability of weak and failed states to carry out basic functions\u2014securing their own borders and populations, providing essential civil services and public goods, and maintaining rule of law and governing legitimacy\u2014can spark a range of crises that might undermine U.S. strategic interests involving terrorism, international crime, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, limiting U.S. access to vital natural resources, and regional stability. Several regions in Africa, particularly the Sahel and the Horn of Africa, could become such risks in pre-conflict conditions. Here Al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb (AQIM) seeks sanctuary in outlying regions such as northern Mali and is making inroads with the Nigerian Taliban.

The National Security Strategies (NSS) put forth by the last three presidential administrations have emphasized this premise. Most recently, the Obama Administration reiterated that \"diplomacy and development capabilities must strengthen weak and failing states,\" that \"failing states breed conflict and endanger regional and global security,\" and that \"our military will continue strengthening its capacity to partner with foreign counterparts, train and assist security forces, and pursue military-to-military ties with a broad range of governments.\"", "There is an opposing view to the assumption that weak and failed states pose a threat to U.S. national security interests. This view points to the ambiguity of defining a \"weak state\" or a \"failed state.\" It further suggests that these states almost never produce threats to national security and that efforts to strengthen them squander resources on threats that exist primarily in the minds of policymakers.", "Other critics are concerned that the oversight and use of a failed state's security forces are much more critical than their capabilities. How a weak or failed state's security force is used\u2014as an instrument to provide security or as a repressive instrument linked to human rights violations\u2014is a more driving concern. That is to say, aside from the fiscal and material resources, building partner capacity \"is a human and institutional development activity, with the training of forces and the development of competent command, control, and governance institutions at its core.\" In this understanding, the investment in building foreign security forces for at-risk states is of limited return without equivalent commitment to reinforcing other necessary government functions.

The administration is considering a proposal to grow the Afghan army by 35,000, which would bring total Afghan security force levels to 378,000 by the end of 2012. These additional forces are meant to add important enablers--logistics, engineering, and intelligence and others--to reinforce and sustain the transition of responsibility to the Afghan security forces. Yet General James Mattis, the commander of U.S. Central Command, raised the question of whether an ANSF of this proposed size would sustain enduring capabilities over time.

Combat commanders convey that the JCET program is a means to support regional stability throughout the theater. Other than combat skills, training that could occur in JCETs might include humanitarian assistance operations, disaster assistance/relief operations, and civic assistance projects. These projects are touted as constructive interactions among foreign military and civilians and U.S. SOF.", "Congress has scrutinized SOF's conduct of SFA via the JCET program. This resulted primarily from some high-profile instances during the 1990s, particularly in Indonesia. In these cases, the partner nation forces that had been trained by U.S. SOF counterparts were shown to have employed the skills they learned in repressive or brutal fashion in suppressing internal and civil disturbances. The program was also criticized for conflicting senses of purpose within the executive branch. In some instances, the State Department made evaluations of nations' human rights record. However, these inspections, and subsequent vetting or condemnation, were not commensurate with the list of nations that were being trained. As a result, Congress enacted legislation to bring JCET more into alignment with policies and to establish more stringent oversight. The Leahy Amendment to the Department of Defense FY1999 Appropriations Act ( P.L. 105-262 ) prohibited the U.S. military from training with human rights abusers (unless the prohibition is waived by the Secretary of Defense).

The \"U.S. government lacks an integrated national security assistance strategy covering all U.S. training and assistance provided to foreign security forces.\"", "Critics of expanded authorities to conduct the training of foreign forces bring up several points. The most frequently heard criticism is the seemingly expansive role of DOD serving as the lead in implementing foreign relations through SFA. Critics caution against reliance on a military-centric approach to international capacity building. This position also highlights the disparity in resources between DOD and DOS and encourages significant investment in the latter as opposed to expanding the authorities of the former.", "A 2007 report to Senate members of the Committee on Foreign Relations highlighted the expanded growth in Department of Defense authorities in the foreign assistance field since 2001. The report had the following recommendations:", "Foreign assistance functions and authorities should not be migrating to the Department of Defense due to inadequate executive branch requests for funding in the proper budget account.", "The Secretary of State should streamline security assistance decision-making to make certain that there is ready flexibility and means to address emerging threats and unexpected opportunities.", "Insufficient funding for foreign assistance in the civilian agency budgets reinforces a migration of foreign aid authorities and functions to the Department of Defense.", "Congress, in cooperation with the executive branch, should undertake an overhaul of the Foreign Assistance Act.", "Too often, Members of Congress narrow their foreign aid focus to favorite or least-favorite countries, specific NGOs or programs, and other unique enthusiasms that end in earmarks or reporting requirements in appropriations bills.", "The executive branch must provide detailed justifications for its requests and a sound strategic rationale for its priorities in order to stave off congressional directives.", "Congressional leadership should find floor time for a foreign aid authorization bill as a routine matter at least every two years.", "Members of Congress should agree on reprogramming levels below which decisions can be made at the embassy level without requiring legislative branch notifications.", "Nevertheless, Congress provided DOD with an opportunity to explicitly spell out what is needed to facilitate building partner capacity.

The fund is seen as one effort that is combined with the State Department's reorganization and a consolidated DOD/DOS Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) budget.", "Some hold that pooling the resources of DOD and State undermines the authorities and responsibilities inherent in each of these organizations. While the security assistance authorities within the Department of Defense have expanded since 9/11, some attest that this has eroded the tradition of State Department leadership in aligning security assistance with America's foreign policy priorities. They argue that a program such as the GSCF would in essence grant the Secretary of Defense a veto over foreign policy decisions made by the Secretary of State. Further, it could misalign the role of the Defense Department in policymaking and the contribution of security assistance to America's delicate diplomatic balance.", "Proponents of this position believe a more appropriate option for Congress would be to amend Section 506 of the Foreign Assistance Act. Such an amendment would authorize the president to direct the drawdown of resources from any agency of the government to provide assistance elsewhere.

These efforts further the U.S. objective of securing a peaceful and cooperative international order. Security cooperation activities include bilateral and multilateral training and exercises, foreign military sales (FMS) and financing (FMF), officer exchange programs, educational opportunities at professional military schools, technical exchanges, and efforts to assist foreign security forces in building competency and capacity. In today's complex and interdependent security environment, these dimensions of the U.S. defense strategy have never been more important. U.S. forces, therefore, will continue to treat the building of partners' security capacity as an increasingly important mission. Within the range of security cooperation activities, the most dynamic in the coming years will be security force assistance (SFA) missions: \"hands on\" efforts, conducted primarily in host countries, to train, equip, advise, and assist those countries' forces in becoming more proficient at providing security to their populations and protecting their resources and territories .

Terrorist groups seek to evade security forces by exploiting ungoverned and undergoverned areas as safe havens from which to recruit, indoctrinate, and train fighters, as well as to plan attacks on U.S. and allied interests. Where appropriate, U.S. forces will work with the military forces of partner nations to strengthen their capacity for internal security, and will coordinate those activities with those of other U.S. government agencies as they work to strengthen civilian capacities, thus denying terrorists and insurgents safe havens.
