Technological improvements in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have unlocked enormous oil and natural gas resources from tight formations, such as shale. In conjunction with the rise in oil and natural gas production, U.S. production of natural gas liquids has also increased.", "Natural gas liquids (NGLs) are a group of hydrocarbons that includes ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline. NGLs are differentiated from one another by the number of carbon atoms in their molecular chain. They have a wide variety of applications from specialized fuels (e.g., propane, butane) to petrochemical feedstocks for making products like plastic and fertilizers.", "NGLs are extracted as byproducts in the production of natural gas and oil. Of these two sources, natural gas processing is by far the most significant, contributing over 90% of NGL production in 2016. When extracted from a well, natural gas is mixed with other hydrocarbons\u2014many of them NGLs\u2014and various impurities. In order for the natural gas to be marketable, the NGLs and impurities must then be removed. The separated NGLs may then be discarded or undergo further processing in order to be sold. The relatively high value of NGLs combined with the rise in natural gas production has led to a rapid rise in NGL production as it has become more economical for processors to sell the separated NGLs.", "The United States is by far the largest producer of NGLs in the world, accounting for more than a third of global production. Domestic NGL production has more than doubled in the 10 years since 2008, reaching 1,381 million barrels in 2017. Ethane and propane are the two most prevalent NGLs, and together they account for more than 70% of all domestic production. As NGL production has risen, it has increasingly outstripped domestic consumption, which has remained relatively flat since 2010 (when EIA began to collect data). Consequently, 37% of U.S. NGL production was exported in 2017. Canada, Japan, and China are currently the largest importers of U.S. NGLs.", "The rapid growth of NGL production has also outpaced the development of supporting infrastructure. NGLs are expensive to transport and handle\u2014requiring high pressures and low temperatures to keep them in a liquid state for shipment. A network of processing plants and distribution methods is necessary to move NGLs from well to market. Moreover, the surplus of NGLs brought upon by domestic production growth is increasing the need for infrastructure to aid in the exportation of NGLs internationally and the storage of NGLs domestically.", "While energy production and consumption have been issues of interest to Congress for decades, the supply, consumption, environment, and trade of NGLs has become a topic of congressional interest more recently. Infrastructure, production, safety, and economics are all critical to the NGL market and may be of interest to Congress. Over 30 bills that relate to NGLs have been introduced in the 115th Congress.

U.S. natural gas production has risen 33% since 2008, and crude oil production has jumped 87%. Both commodities are also being exported in growing quantities. In between natural gas and crude oil is a group of hydrocarbons referred to as natural gas liquids (NGLs). NGLs, which make up about 4% of the U.S. energy mix, include ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, and pentanes (which includes natural gasoline). The United States is the largest producer of NGLs in the world. NGLs are differentiated from one another by the number of carbon atoms in their molecular chain. ", "Natural gas liquids are extracted as a mixture of hydrocarbons and other gases and are produced and separated from one of two sources: natural gas processing or crude oil refining. (See Appendix for additional information.) Mainly due to the shale revolution, which uses horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, NGL production in the United States has grown at a rapid rate since 2008.", "This report focuses on NGLs and not the various petrochemical products, like plastics or fertilizer, they can create. However, the report aims to give a general overview of the use, production, price trends, exports/imports, and infrastructure needs for processing and transporting NGLs, as well as policy issues."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NGLs: What's Included?", "paragraphs": ["Ethane (C2H6) is the simplest of all the NGL hydrocarbons. With only two carbon atoms in its molecular makeup, it is the lightest NGL, the hardest to liquefy, and the one with the lowest heat content (as measured in British thermal units or Btus). Due to the difficulty of liquefying ethane compared to the other NGLs, it is the most energy intensive and expensive to separate from raw gas streams and to store and transport after recovery. The vast majority of ethane produced in the United States is sent to domestic petrochemical companies to make ethylene, a building block for a variety of products like plastic bottles, trash bags, antifreeze, PVC piping, and detergent. Between 2010 (as far back as the EIA data set goes) and 2017, there has been a more than 35% increase in domestic consumption of ethane. Meanwhile, U.S. production of ethane has more than doubled. The rise in ethane production has put downward pressure on its price and has prompted companies to export ethane. ", "Propane (C3H8) is the second-simplest NGL hydrocarbon, with three carbon atoms. It has a much higher boiling point than ethane (-128 degrees Fahrenheit for ethane compared to -44 degrees Fahrenheit for propane). Like ethane, it is typically stored in canisters at high pressure, so it can be transported as a liquid. This pressure is about one-quarter of what it takes to liquefy ethane at a similar temperature. As a result, it is far less energy intensive to pressurize propane to a sufficient degree for it to be liquefied than it is for ethane, making it more desirable as a portable fuel. Propane is used as a feedstock at petrochemical plants, and it can also be converted into polypropylene, which is used in injection moldings and to create resins, plastics, and some adhesives. It is also used in residential and commercial heating, and is therefore highly seasonal in its demand. Propane production has increased by almost 150% since 2008, and of all the NGL- derives the largest percentage of its production from oil refining (roughly 20%). Propane has been exported for years (as propane and as a component of liquefied petroleum gas or LPG); the relatively low cost of U.S. propane in recent years has driven substantial international demand, especially from Asia.", "Normal Butane (C4H10) , or just butane, is the first of the two forms of the four-carbon NGL hydrocarbons. Butane has a significantly higher boiling point (30 degrees Fahrenheit) than either propane or ethane, but it is still a gas at room temperature and standard pressure. Normal butane has two primary uses: as a fuel additive in motor gasoline (usually during colder months) and as a petrochemical feedstock. The critical petrochemical product that can be made from processing butane is butadiene, a key component in synthetic rubber. Butane production has more than doubled since 2008, while consumption and growth have been sporadic, rising in some years and declining in others. The relative surge in production has corresponded with an increase in exports as well. Butane, like propane, is an LPG component and exported in that form as well. Butane prices tend to be linked to oil prices because of its use as a gasoline additive.", "Isobutane (C4H10) , by molecular makeup, is identical to butane with four carbon atoms. The atoms, however, are arranged in a different shape than in butane, giving it slightly different properties, such as a different vapor pressure and boiling point. The majority of isobutane (60%) is used in a refinery process called alkylation, which converts it into alkylate. Alkylate is an ingredient of high-octane low-vapor-pressure motor gasoline. Other uses of isobutane include as a fuel for lighters and camping stoves, a replacement for Freon in refrigerators, and a propellant in hair and cooking sprays. Isobutane makes up one of the smallest percentages of total NGL growth, due mostly to its relatively small contribution to the total makeup of NGLs. However, like the other NGLs, it has experienced a sharp uptick in production over the last decade. Consumption of isobutane is also rising. The United States is a net importer of isobutane, mainly from Canada. Isobutane prices tend to follow butane prices, but at a premium because of the additional processing required to create it.", "Pentanes (C5H12) , also referred to as natural gasoline, are perhaps the most unique NGL. They are a mixture of different hydrocarbons with five or sometimes six carbon atoms. Most pentanes are used as a blending fuel in oil refineries to make motor gasoline. They are also used as a petrochemical feedstock, as a denaturant in ethanol to make it undrinkable, and as a diluent for heavy crude (the fastest-growing source of demand). Other NGLs have pushed pentane demand lower as a petrochemical feedstock. Pentanes production has grown, but not as much as other NGLs. Most exports of pentanes go to Canada, where their demand as a diluent is high. The price of pentanes tends to track gasoline and crude oil prices."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The NGL Energy Chain", "paragraphs": ["The United States is the world's largest producer of NGLs.

As U.S. production of NGLs rises, a subsequent build-out of the necessary infrastructure to process and transport the products downstream is similarly increasing\u2014albeit somewhat delayed. The distance, cost, and ease of taking NGL products to market can have a significant effect on their market prices and demand.", "Specific areas of the country, for example Texas, benefit from a long history of hydrocarbon extraction and processing. (See Figure 1 .) These regions, mostly located on the Gulf Coast, can take advantage of already existing pipelines, refineries, processing plants, and petrochemical processing sites. Other areas of the country, like the Appalachian region, Kansas, and North Dakota, have had difficulty adding infrastructure to match their growing output of NGLs.", "In areas of the country, like Pennsylvania, where the construction of pipelines is lagging behind the increasing production of NGLs, the use of more expensive methods of transportation (e.g., rail cars) has become necessary, driving up costs.

The output from the Northeast has grown by over 2,200% since 2008 to make up over 11% of all U.S. NGL production in 2017 (it made up 1% in 2008). The Gulf Coast states, however, still comprise 54% of total U.S. NGL production.", "The vast majority of the growth in NGL production has been driven primarily by increases in ethane and propane production. The prominence of ethane and propane is due to the substantial portion they make up of NGLs. In 2017, 70% of all NGLs produced were either ethane or propane (see Figure 2 ). ", "To understand and accurately discuss the full well-to-market lifespan of natural gas liquids, it is useful to start with natural gas as a foundation. Although NGLs may be obtained from both natural gas processing and crude oil refining, they come predominantly from the former\u2014with over 90% of all U.S. NGL production coming from natural gas processing. This makeup varies based on each hydrocarbon, but none derive more than 20% of their total production from crude oil.", "Natural gas itself is composed of almost entirely methane (C1), the simplest of all hydrocarbons, and can come from both natural gas and crude oil wells. When it is produced from an oil well, it is referred to as associated natural gas. There is no chemical distinction between associated gas and natural gas coming from a gas well. Over 99% of all EIA-documented wells produced both oil and natural gas.", "Natural gas, when extracted from a wellhead, contains methane, a variety of other hydrocarbons (most of them NGLs), and various impurities including hydrogen sulfide and water. This mixture of chemicals is referred to as \"raw gas,\" and it can come from both conventional wells and shale wells. When the raw gas has a high concentration of NGLs, it is described as being \"wet.\" (See textbox.)", "As of 2016, 33 states had at least one natural gas well. Moreover, in that same year, there were over 2 million active natural gas wells in the United States. Texas had the most natural gas wells, with over 500,000 active sites.

The resulting mix of NGLs and other hydrocarbons (known as a \"y-grade mix\" or \"raw mix\") is then further separated into individual product streams.", "The separation of NGLs from the raw gas stream occurs after impurities have been removed. When raw gas is initially extracted from a wellhead, it can contain varying degrees of impurities that may include water vapor, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen, oxygen, helium, and particulate matter. These impurities must be removed from natural gas before it can be pressurized and transported in long-distance pipelines that will carry it to market. If too many impurities are present in the gas stream, they can cause compressors to malfunction and pipes to corrode, rupture, or even explode. ", "To remove these impurities, raw gas streams are sent by pipeline to treatment plants (see Figure 3 ). From there, the cleaned raw gas mixture is sent to a natural gas processing plant. In these plants the inlet-gas stream is cooled to the point where the NGLs in the stream condense into a liquid and separate out of the gas. ", "Once the inlet stream has been sent through the processing plant, there are two distinct outlet streams that are handled separately. The first stream consists of mainly natural gas and is sometimes referred to as either residue or tailgate gas. That stream will then typically be moved via pipeline to market. The second stream is mostly made up of NGLs (i.e., a y-grade mix). This outlet stream is typically then sent to a fractionator site to be broken up into its individual hydrocarbons. ", "Longer chain hydrocarbons (i.e., those with more carbon atoms) tend to have higher vaporization temperatures. Given this difference, fractionator sites increase the temperature of the y-grade mixture at incremental levels to vaporize one specific hydrocarbon at a time. First, the y-grade mix is sent to a deethanizer where ethane is boiled out of the mixture and is allowed to flow out through the top of a container, as a gas, to a new storage tank where it is cooled, condensed, and stored. This process repeatedly occurs until all the NGLs have been separated from one another.

Some regions, like the Kansas-Oklahoma production area, are extracting more hydrocarbons than they can transport and therefore are having to build out their storage capacities.

Since production levels rarely fluctuate throughout the year, companies may find it advantageous to build inventories in the summer for shipment out in the winter. Another reason companies may choose to increase storage capabilities is to hold short-term supplies for iterative shipping methods such as barges and railcars, which can only transport certain amounts of NGLs at one time, necessitating onsite storage.

These lower prices make them a very competitive feedstock for petrochemical companies to make products like plastic. U.S. companies tend to have petrochemical plants outfitted for using ethane and other NGLs while global competitors tend to have plants designed to use heavier hydrocarbons that are more expensive as a petrochemical feedstock (e.g., naphtha, which is derived from oil and therefore linked to oil prices).

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the authority to regulate emissions of VOCs under the Clean Air Act because they contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone (smog). Studies have linked ozone to negative human health affects including respiratory ailments and premature mortality. Ozone has also been linked to plant damage and decreases in crop yield. Studies have linked exceedances of the federal air quality standards for ozone to oil and gas development in rural regions of Wyoming and Utah with VOCs playing a key role. Measurement studies in and around major U.S. oil and gas fields suggest that NGLs make up a significant portion of total VOC emissions from oil and gas production activities. Emissions of these ozone precursors can impact air quality, both locally and in downwind areas. ", "As stated, NGLs are primarily emitted to the atmosphere through unintended releases commonly referred to as fugitive emissions. By definition, fugitive releases are diffuse, transitory, and elusive. Thus, one of the greater difficulties in fully understanding the impacts of NGL emissions is the development of a comprehensive and consistent inventory of sources and emissions. EPA's National Emissions Inventory (NEI) is a bottom-up accounting of emissions that uses commonly accepted emissions factors with best available activity data to calculate an inventory for each source category. According to NEI data, emissions of total VOCs from oil and gas production and refining have increased by about 80% (from 1,814 to 3,281 thousand tons) between 2008 and 2014, the latest available data.

Attributing these top-down estimates to specific source categories is a challenging and difficult task. Notwithstanding, a recent academic study found that after decreasing for almost 30 years, concentrations of individual NGLs in the Northern Hemisphere began to increase around 2009, and the rate of increase has been growing. The scientists reporting this finding used spatial patterns of ambient measurements of NGLs with shorter atmospheric lifetimes to identify oil and gas production regions in the United States as the most likely source of the increasing atmospheric concentrations of NGLs.

For example, in 2012 and 2016 EPA promulgated New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for VOC emissions from new and modified activities and equipment in the oil and gas sector. EPA has also provided VOC reduction guidelines to state, local, and tribal air agencies for existing oil and gas sources in ozone nonattainment areas and states in the Ozone Transport Region.

The rise in ethane production has put intense downward pressure on its price. The falling profitability of ethane recovery, due to the falling price, has introduced a surprising phenomenon in the production line, something known as ethane rejection. If a plant determines that ethane recovery is not profitable at a particular time, usually by considering price spreads, they will operate in what is sometimes referred to as rejection mode. When they are in this operating mode, firms leave the ethane they receive from raw gas streams in the natural gas to be sold as natural gas (natural gas is sold on a per-BTU basis and not by volume).

In 2013, there was a tremendous increase in consumption due to an unusually wet corn crop season which was followed by the 2013-2014 polar vortex winter. The resultant surge in demand led to a spike in propane prices for the year. Since then both the demand and price have stabilized. The emerging trend, however, since 2016, is decreasing demand for propane.
