First, impacts are very difficult to predict, even for experts working in AI and automation. For example, in a 2014 survey of expert \"technology builders and analysts\" by Pew Research Center, 48% of respondents predicted that AI and robots would displace more jobs than they created by 2025, while the remaining 52% predicted that more jobs would be created than displaced. Second, the range of methodologies used in such workforce reports makes comparing studies challenging, thereby adding to the difficulty in projecting workforce impacts. Third, the studies raise additional questions that may have implications for both civilian and military workers. These include, but are not limited to, the following:", "Will AI and RAS displace certain skills/tasks or entire jobs, and what types of roles will the new technologies fill? If certain skills/tasks are automated, employees might have opportunities to upgrade the skills of their employers. If entire jobs are eliminated, employers could be reluctant to maintain the size of their workforce and pay for employee re-skilling while also investing in AI and RAS technologies. How will the pace of innovation and adoption of new technologies affect the workforce and corresponding labor policies? Some experts argue that AI and RAS technologies are developing much more rapidly than disruptive technologies of prior years (which have largely involved physical systems such as automated teller machines at banks) and a subsequent long time lag between innovation and full adoption. While there have been concerns about automation and new technologies displacing middle class workers for the past two centuries, the ability to implement AI systems and software on existing physical hardware could facilitate rapid adoption and allow for more disruptive changes to the labor market than have been seen historically. Further, RAS and AI technologies together can replace both physical and cognitive labor. Some analysts have raised concerns that wide spread adoption of AI and RAS systems might cause shifts in the workforce that outpace changes to labor policies. Are there a sufficient number of AI and RAS experts in the workforce to implement the technologies across the public and private sectors? A number of studies have noted that there is far more demand than supply of such experts.

Joint combined arms maneuver in the 21 st century requires ready ground combat forces capable of outmaneuvering adversaries physically and cognitively in all domains. Through credible forward presence and resilient battle formations, future ground forces integrate and synchronize joint, interorganizational, and multinational capabilities to create temporary windows of superiority across multiple domains; seize, retain, and exploit the initiative; and achieve military objectives. Investments in Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) capabilities allows future enemies to engage Army forces earlier and at greater distances. In addition, adversaries will look to emplace obstacles to threaten movement and maneuver across extended avenues of advance.
