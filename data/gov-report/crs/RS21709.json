Even so, only about 25,000 MT of U.S. beef has been exported to Korea since then. Korea rejected renewed shipments of U.S. beef first because they found bone fragments, albeit very small ones typically acceptable in commercial trade, and, later, for what they said were unacceptable dioxin levels. No beef has entered since October 2007.", "On April 18, 2008, the United States and Korea announced a new agreement to fully reopen Korea's market consistent with OIE guidelines. Specifically, the agreement was to allow all U.S. beef and beef products from cattle of all ages, to include bone-in as well as boneless beef, along with offals, variety meats, and processed beef products. This was dependent upon the removal of the following SRMs: the tonsils and part of the small intestine of all cattle; and the brain, eyes, spinal cord, skull, dorsal root ganglia, and vertebral column from all cattle of 30 months and older, again consistent with OIE guidelines. In a two-stage reopening, Korea was to open first to beef from under-30-month old cattle. It next was to allow beef from all cattle, upon publication of final rules, promulgated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), expanding the restrictions on feeding SRMs to animals and pets. Because these feed rules were published in the April 25, 2008, Federal Register , the hope was that the Korean market would soon be opened fully rather than in stages.", "U.S. officials said Korea had promised not to close its entire market again due to violations by a single plant, among other assurances intended to open and then maintain beef trade.

Special labeling requirements applied to T-bone and Porterhouse steak exports for the first 180 days, and there are restrictions on beef from Canadian-sourced cattle.

By June 3, 2008, the Korean government asked that beef from cattle older than 30 months not be shipped.

A National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA) economist estimated that the agreement could lead to a $1 billion annually in sales there. Still, the United States is a long way from attaining its historic annual share of Korean beef imports, which amounted to around 50% of the export market for beef prior to the 2003 BSE event.

The Japanese abruptly halted imports from all U.S. importers again on January 20, 2006, after they found vertebral column bones in several boxes of veal from one U.S. processor.

But U.S. exports have encountered continuing beef safety concerns among some consumers, strict port scrutiny of U.S. shipments, uncertainty about U.S. supplies of age-qualified animals, a shift in consumer choice of protein from beef to pork, and competition for the Japanese market from Australia, a BSE-free exporter. Australia currently provides about 88% of Japanese imports of chilled and frozen beef. FAS said another potential constraint to expanding U.S. beef exports to Japan is that country's possible imposition of a beef import safeguard (a 50% tariff) should imports in 2008 exceed trigger levels. The current beef import safeguard is set at a level that would not trigger imposition of the safeguard, but it is possible that the safeguard, established annually, could be set at a level in 2008 that could seriously curtail U.S. beef exports."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "In Congress", "paragraphs": ["Legislative initiatives in the 110 th Congress will depend in large part on the pace of resumption of U.S. beef imports by Japan."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Canada Situation", "paragraphs": ["On July 18, 2005, the U.S. border reopened to imports from Canada of live cattle under 30 months old, under USDA's Initial Minimal Risk Rule. The reopening was the first time in more than two years, since Canada's BSE incident in May 2003, that live cattle from Canada were eligible to enter the United States. On September 14, 2007, USDA announced its Minimal Risk Rule 2 (MRR2), a final rule that allows for the importation of live cattle and other bovine species (e.g., bison) for any use (including breeding animals born on or after March 1, 1999, a date APHIS had determined to be the effective enforcement of Canada's ruminant-to-ruminant feed ban). The final rule became effective November 19, 2007.

R-CALF's legal efforts to block issuance of earlier rules also did not meet with success.", "One major concern of some cattlemen has been that MRR2 would result in a flood of Canadian cull cattle exports to the United States. Analysis by USDA, however, suggests that, for a variety of reasons, this was unlikely to occur. FAS lists, among factors that will impede the flow of cull cattle from Canada to the United States, an increase in Canadian slaughter capacity for cull cattle that reduces the supply of culled animals available for export; a large number of Canadian cull cattle that are currently older than eight years and thus disqualified from export eligibility by the age requirements in MRR2; and a strengthening of Canadian cattle prices as the MRR2 rule goes into effect. U.S. imports of Canadian cattle had fallen to 512,000 head in 2003, and virtually none in 2004, but recovered to approximately 1.4 million in 2007, still somewhat below their pre-BSE annual level of 1.7 million, according to USDA data.", "Besides concerns about competition from increased Canadian live cattle imports, there were worries that opening the border to what some believe are potentially risky Canadian animals will undermine efforts to regain the Japanese and Korean markets.

One reason is that the United States, learning from Europe, was able to put BSE safeguards into place prior to its own first case.

Before the BSE events, Canada exported 37% of its beef production, whereas the United States exported 9%.", "In 2003, the U.S. ban on Canadian beef and cattle, coupled with already tight U.S. supplies and strong demand, had driven up U.S. beef and cattle prices substantially. After the December 2003 BSE case was announced, cattle prices fell but quickly stabilized. Continuing demand, plus lower U.S. cattle inventories due in part to widespread drought in cattle country, kept cattle and beef prices high during 2004, helping to offset the effects of the BSE-related foreign bans. USDA reported average U.S. fed steer (i.e., slaughter-ready cattle) prices at nearly $85 per cwt. for all of 2004, compared with average fed steer prices of $85 in 2003 and $67 in 2002.

The loss of beef export markets also meant that by-product prices were lower than they would have been. The total estimated U.S. beef industry losses attributable to loss of beef and by-product exports in 2004 ranged from $3.2 to $4.7 billion, according to the study."], "subsections": []}]}}
