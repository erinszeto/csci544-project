The use of financial sanctions, particularly those imposed on Banco Delta Asia, dominated post-September Accord speeches from North Korean officials. North Korea used the Banco Delta Asia action as its justification for not attending six-party talks, though many analysts suggest that North Korea would have stayed away in any event and the bank action just provided a convenient rationale.

The DPRK wants peace but is not afraid of war.\"", "While few states have fully normalized relations with North Korea, only the United States has, until North Korea's nuclear test, maintained fairly comprehensive economic sanctions against that country since the 1950-53 conflict. Indeed, in 2002 some analysts proffered that North Korea's coyness about its nuclear weapons pursuits was calculated, in part, to increase pressure to remove the remaining U.S. sanctions\u2014particularly those associated with its designation as a supporter of international terrorism. A desire for increased economic assistance, normalization of economic and diplomatic relations, and a nonaggression pact between North Korea and the United States might also be motivating factors.", "In response to the nuclear program start-up in 2002, and other foreign relations matters pending between the various neighboring states and North Korea, and without a U.N. Security Council resolution, North Korea's trading partners imposed unilateral economic and diplomatic sanctions. For example, Japan suspended rice shipments and later required all ships using its ports to have substantial environmental and accident liability insurance, a cost that few North Korean shippers could likely bear. Japan also has stated that relations between the two countries will not be normalized until North Korea is verifiably denuclearized. In December 2002, Japan, South Korea, and the United States suspended oil shipments promised under the 1994 Agreed Framework. Australia delayed opening an embassy in Pyongyang, originally scheduled to open by mid-2003, until the nuclear weapons issue is resolved. Reportedly in 2003, China briefly shut off deliveries through its oil pipeline to North Korea to pressure North Korea to join the first round of six-party talks, though subsequently declined to take this step a second time.", "The new economic sanctions mandated by the United Nations barely tax the United States economy because of its relative lack of economic engagement with North Korea. North Korea's neighbors\u2014China, Japan, and South Korea\u2014however, conduct ever-increasing trade with North Korea, and account for 78.7% of North Korea's exports. In 2005, trade between North Korea and South Korea exceeds $1 billion. Trade with China, Thailand, and Japan account for 48.4% of North Korea's imports. Trade between China and North Korea nearly doubled between 2002 and 2004, to $1.39 billion. Trade between North Korea and Russia skyrocketed from $80.7 million in 2002 to $218.4 million in 2004. Efforts to isolate and contain the country would require some economic sacrifice from all of North Korea's trading partners. The economic and social costs to North Korea, on the other hand, could be enormous, as it has come to rely on South\u00a0Korea and China for food and energy, and in times of crisis has relied on all the six-party talk participants\u2014including the United States\u2014for substantial food aid and fuel oil shipments. One concern far greater than trade loss, of course, at least for North Korea's geographic neighbors, is that severe economic restrictions push the country and its government toward failure and collapse.", "Following a North/South summit in 2000, South Korean companies began to invest in an industrial zone along the North Korea-South Korea border, in part to alleviate South Korea's domestic labor shortage. The industrial zone in Kaesong (Gaesong) hosts 15 South Korean businesses overseeing and financing the productions of garments and kitchenware, and is subsidized by the South Korean government. North Korea, after years of negotiation with South Korea, enacted a law in November 2002 to guarantee visa-free access and corporate tax incentives to encourage cross-border development and investment. It is likely that North Korea sees benefits in South Korea's Sunshine Policy of greater engagement, inasmuch as its own gross domestic product (GDP) per capita at $1,000 pales to that of $18,000 in South Korea. While the goods, services, and materials that cross the North/South border to support Kaesong or as Kaesong's output would not be subject to the U.N. sanctions\u2014because the goods and services, at this time, do not have a military application\u2014a debate has emerged within South Korea as to the wisdom of continuing inter-Korean ties.
