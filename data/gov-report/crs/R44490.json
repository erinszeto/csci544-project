(Businesses that are not would-be government contractors also may apply for a DUNS number.) The federal government's use of DUNS, however, is not limited to the identification numbers. D&B provides, pursuant to its contract with the General Services Administration (GSA), 7 types of software products and 14 data products that enable the government to use DUNS for a variety of acquisition-related functions, such as paying contractors. Furthermore, approximately 80 data systems within the federal government contain DUNS information.", "Congress may have concerns regarding the continued use of DUNS numbers and has expressed interest in exploring other options. At the request of a Senate subcommittee, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined the costs and data restrictions involved with using a proprietary identification system and studied alternatives for identification numbers for government contractors. The implementation of the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act; P.L. 113-101) is accompanied by similar, significant interest within Congress\u2014and within the agencies charged with implementing the act\u2014for exploring options for a nonproprietary contractor identification system.", "One or more possible options might involve using an existing, nonproprietary identification system created and maintained by the federal government: the commercial and government entity (CAGE) code system. CAGE codes could be used as a stand-alone system, or incorporated into a hybrid system (e.g., combine CAGE codes with vendor-provided business products and services). The CAGE Branch of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) assigns the five-character alpha-numeric identifiers to entities located in the United States and outlying areas.", "Regulatory changes in 2014 and 2016 potentially pave the way for the government to adopt a new system. First, in 2014, a rule was adopted in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requiring prospective contractors to obtain CAGE codes.

Second, a final rule issued in 2016 removed all references to the Data Universal Numbering System and DUNS numbers from the FAR and inserted the terms unique entity identifier.

To aid in accurately identifying the entities with which it does business, the federal government relies on a proprietary system, Dun & Bradstreet's (D&B's) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS). Dun & Bradstreet assigns unique identification codes known as \"DUNS numbers\" to prospective federal government contractors. The federal government has used DUNS since at least the early 1990s to meet its needs for an identification system and related services.", "Whereas the government's continued use of DUNS was supported by the executive branch as recently as 2006, as documented in a Federal Register notice, the federal government has begun exploring alternatives to DUNS and DUNS numbers again.

Notable legislative initiatives in this area have included passage of the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA; P.L. 109-282 ) and the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act; P.L. 113-101 ). The government's change in perspective is reflected in separate, though possibly coordinated, efforts by the General Services Administration (GSA), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of the Treasury, to examine possible alternatives to DUNS. The Treasury Department-OMB effort is related, as discussed below, to implementation of the DATA Act.", "The following two sections, \" Data Universal Numbering System \" and \" Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) System and Codes ,\" provide basic information about these two systems, respectively. The final section discusses the federal government's reliance on DUNS, interest in and exploration of alternatives to DUNS, and government actions that possibly could pave the way for the adoption of an alternative system, or a hybrid system that includes DUNS.

", "GSA believes that, in effect, D&B has a monopoly, which stems from, at least in part, the regulatory requirement that companies and other entities seeking to do business with the federal government obtain a DUNS number. The lack of competition for an identification system has, according to GSA, led to higher costs. Dun & Bradstreet has placed proprietary restrictions on GSA's use of DUNS numbers, which limit \"how and where Dun & Bradstreet data can be used.\" GSA's contract with Dun & Bradstreet contains other restrictions \"that could cause challenges for the government if it were to change to an alternative numbering system.\" GSA has indicated that its contract with D&B \"specifies that the government would have to delete certain Dun & Bradstreet provided data [e.g., business name and address] from its databases at the end of the GSA contract.\"", "As reported by GAO, GSA initially considered four options: (1) continue to use DUNS and related services; (2) if acquisition planning identified potential competitors to D&B, conduct a procurement to select a contractor; (3) \"[c]hange to a non-proprietary solution\"; or (4) switch to government-owned system coupled with vendor-provided data services. Eventually, GSA winnowed its options: continue to use D&B's DUNS numbers, or replace it with a government-owned numbering system. However, GAO also reported that GSA had begun another effort to identify options and was expected to issue a report by September 2012. The status and content of this report is not known, as GSA \"never intended [it] to be a public document.\"", "Anticipated benefits from replacing DUNS with a government-owned, nonproprietary system include \"long-term cost savings, unlimited data rights, and greater transparency.\" Switching from one set of identification codes to another, however, most likely would trigger a series of changes. Anticipated changes, as described by GAO, could include the following: ", "\"[C]hanging to a government-owned number would require GSA to establish a registration process and add the ability to provide corporate linkage information and add data verification and monitoring capabilities.\" \"To accommodate a new number, GSA and other agencies would have to change the names of data fields and possibly add new data fields or modify the format of the existing DUNS field in their data systems. For example, DUNS numbers are numeric whereas SAM numbers are alpha-numeric and therefore may not be compatible with current DUNS data fields.\" \"Changing numbering systems could require agencies to delete DUNS information, including contractor name and address, from their data systems and replace it with information from the new numbering system. This process could be complicated by the data restrictions in GSA's contract with Dun & Bradstreet.\" \"GSA would have to modify the FAR to remove the DUNS requirement and agencies would have to update their FAR supplements. Agencies would also have to update acquisition-related policies, procedures, and documents that refer to DUNS numbers.\" ", "Potentially compounding the challenges involved in replacing DUNS with another unique identification system is the extent to which the federal government relies on D&B's products. \"[A]pproximately 80 data systems [within the federal government contain] DUNS information,\" according to GSA, and \"would therefore have to be modified in the event of a transition to a new numbering system.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The DATA Act and Unique Identifiers", "paragraphs": ["Enacted on May 9, 2014, the DATA Act gave the Director of OMB and the Secretary of the Treasury responsibility for operating the USAspending.gov website, including the development, or adoption, of data elements.
