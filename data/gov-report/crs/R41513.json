The university could not legally deed its land to the federal government, so another provision of the PLA was relied upon to effect federal supervision of the facility. Rather than taking title to the presidential archival facility, the Archivist of the United States relied upon his authority to", "make agreements, upon terms and conditions he considers proper, with a State, political subdivision, university, institution of higher learning, institute, or foundation to use as a Presidential archival depository land, buildings, and equipment of the State, subdivision, university or other organization, to be made available by it without transfer of title to the United States, and maintain, operate and protect the depository as a part of the national archives system.", "Pursuant to this authority, an agreement or memorandum of understanding was executed regarding the federal supervision of the Johnson Presidential Library.

Under the current arrangement, SMU retains sole ownership of the property and NARA is provided with exclusive rights to use their portion of the facility. ", "In addition to funding the 13 \"official\" presidential libraries, Congress has occasionally provided specific funding for private facilities honoring former presidents. These libraries, which hold the documents of former Presidents who served prior to Herbert Hoover, may receive a direct line item in the annual appropriations process. For example, Congress appropriated $1 million in 1996 for the Calvin Coolidge Memorial Foundation, $500,000 in 1997 for the Rutherford B. Hayes home, $3 million in 1999 for the Abraham Lincoln library, and $365,000 in 2000 for the Ulysses S. Grant boyhood home.

A large number of the records available at the various libraries around the nation are now available online or in other electronic formats. The presidential libraries and their support foundations use the Internet for more than just giving researchers access to records: many libraries now offer virtual tours of their facilities online. Use of these electronic resources can make presidential records available to researchers anywhere in the country, rather than requiring researchers to visit the library facilities. Presidential libraries are also using the Internet to publicize and share curricular resources for educators.

At that time, the library was maintained jointly by the state of Ohio and the Rutherford B. Hayes-Lucy Webb Hayes Foundation. Today the repository, still run by Ohio and the foundation, is known as the Rutherford B. Hayes Library. In 1919, Herbert Hoover pledged $50,000 to Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, to establish an institution that would serve as a repository of records of both Hoover's military and political careers, and would later hold President Hoover's personal materials. The record-keeping repository and research institution was completed for $600,000, and was named the Hoover Library on War, Revolution, and Peace. ", "President Roosevelt built upon these two models and developed the concept of a privately built, publicly maintained presidential library. In December 1938, he organized an executive committee to create a presidential library for his records and recruited Waldo Gifford Leland, a distinguished historian and leader in the archiving field, to be chairman of the committee.

The members also concluded that \"new legislation would have to be enacted \u2026 to enable the [g]overnment to accept the gifts of collections, land, and building and to provide for their administration.\" The executive committee then decided to create a larger 30-member National Advisory Committee, consisting of historians and scholars to help determine what should be included in the repository. In addition, the executive committee formalized the creation of a group of 63 underwriters for the repository project (the group referred to itself as the \"committee on Ways and Means\"). The executive committee made a collective guarantee of $450,000 for the project. Finally, the executive committee created a corporation, the Franklin D.

On the Form 990, foundations must report information concerning their finances, including such things as the amounts raised through donations and other sources; their expenses broken down by category (e.g., compensation, programs, etc.); and information on their assets and endowment funds. Foundations must also provide information about their operations, including descriptions of the programs and other activities that justify their Section 501(c)(3) status. The Form 990s are open to public inspection, along with the library foundations' applications for exempt status and, if applicable, unrelated business income tax return. The returns may be requested from the IRS or the foundation, and the foundations' recent Form 990s are available on a private website at http://www.Guidestar.org . ", "With respect to donors, federal law generally does not require public disclosure of their identities. While foundations must disclose donors who have contributed at least $5,000 during the year to the IRS on the Form 990, no identifying information about these donors is required to be publicly disclosed. There is one limited exception in federal law that requires public donor disclosure\u2014the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 (HLOGA). HLOGA requires registered lobbyists who contribute $200 or more to library foundations (in the aggregate and over six-month reporting periods) to disclose the contributions in reports filed with the Clerk of the House and Secretary of the Senate, and these reports are publicly available. These requirements also apply to organizations employing registered lobbyists and political action committees maintained or controlled by lobbyists.", "In the 113 th Congress, legislation was introduced to require greater transparency in the donations process. The Presidential Library Donation Reform Act of 2014 ( H.R. 1133 and S. 2640 ) would have required presidential library foundations to report, on a quarterly basis, contributions of $200 or more to the Archivist. The reporting requirement would have applied to any entity \"established to raise funds to create, maintain, expand, or conduct activities at\" a presidential library or facility related to a library. The information that would have been required to be reported would be the amount, date, and source of the contribution (including the address and occupation of the donor). The foundation would have had to report the information until the later of (1) the date on which the Archivist accepts, takes title to, or enters into an agreement to use any land or facility for the presidential library or (2) the date on which the relevant President no longer holds office. The Archivist would have been required to publish the donor information on NARA's website in a searchable database. Finally, the act would also have made it unlawful to knowingly and willfully make or accept a donation in the name of another person. H.R. 1133 was reported by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in June 2013, and S. 2640 was reported, with amendment, by the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs in August 2014.

The scholar also suggested that the libraries tend to morph presidential history into presidential myth.", "In 2006, The Public Historian , a scholarly journal that focuses on public history, published an issue that focused on presidential libraries. Within the issue, several scholars\u2014including a representative from NARA\u2014expressed concerns about the practices at presidential libraries.", "In the issue, scholar Benjamin Hufbauer, for example, described the dual nature of presidential libraries as follows:", "Because federal presidential libraries are built and their operations are then partially supported by private foundations created by a president and his supporters, but are run by the federal government's National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the museum's exhibits display a tension between history and \"heritage.\" The heritage industry, as Michael Kammen has written, advances \"an impulse to remember what is attractive and flattering and to ignore all the rest.\"", "Mr. Hufbauer noted, for example, that the Reagan library's \"museum displays do not have 'any coverage' at all of the [Iran-Contra] scandal.\" The JFK Library Museum, he noted, \"does not address in detail JFK's numerous health problems and extramarital affairs, even though they have been thoroughly documented.\" The Nixon library does not mention that Gerald Ford pardoned President Nixon for his participation in the Watergate cover up.", "Also in The Public Historian , Sharon K. Fawcett, who currently serves as NARA's Assistant Archivist at the Office of Presidential Libraries, cited a handbook on presidential libraries that required \"exhibits in Presidential libraries \u2026 be consistent with the dignity of the presidency and \u2026 present historically accurate and balanced interpretations of the former President and major events.\" Ms. Fawcett continued:", "The manual, now largely obsolete, offers no suggestions for achieving this important goal other than a requirement, not strictly enforced when funding for new exhibits shifted from the government to the foundations or other non-appropriated revenue sources, that exhibit plans be submitted to the assistant archivist for approval.", "Ms. Fawcett, however, said that in all cases, \"the library and the supporting foundation often work seamlessly together to provide a wide variety of public programming.\" ", "Scholar Larry J. Hackman argued in The Public Historian , that the Office of Presidential Libraries within NARA has not instituted \"significant policies or guidelines\" for the establishment of educational and public programs at the libraries, and the programs that are on display \"do not appear to have received meaningful evaluation.\" Mr. Hackman suggested that this lack of policy may be the result of NARA feeling that \"it should not be held fully accountable if it cannot fund, or adequately control, the development of this major museum component of each library. Most of all, the Archives may fear that a more formal and extensive policy on exhibits would create high tension with influential individuals interested in such exhibits, especially in new libraries and those of living presidents.\" Hackman argued for centralized policies and procedures for vetting permanent exhibits within the libraries.", "Ms. Fawcett pointed out, however, that the supporting foundations could choose not to fund any exhibits that contain content with which they do not agree. Later in the article Ms. Fawcett said NARA and, specifically, the Office of Presidential Libraries can offer \"to those who view the exhibit a better understanding of what they are seeing by explaining that the exhibit is donated to the government by the president's foundation.\"", "Although foundation-sponsored exhibits may prompt some concern, some libraries have partnered with their supporting foundation to create what Ms. Fawcett called \"a remarkable program of temporary exhibits, scholarly conferences, and other public programs.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Federated System", "paragraphs": ["As discussed earlier in this report, the presidential library system is federated\u2014not centralized\u2014with each library in a different physical location. The reasons for this separation of libraries were varied. In a 1955 scholarly article on presidential papers and presidential libraries, one observer argued that keeping presidential libraries in the hometowns of the Presidents allows researchers to understand \"first-hand, that Independence, Missouri or Abilene, Kansas does not leave the same mark upon the personality of a man as Hyde Park, New York or Fremont, Ohio.\" And, as stated in the House report that accompanied the PLA, having such important records dispersed in various locations is a \"highly desirable objective at any time, particularly in this atomic age.\"", "Since the 1955 enactment of the PLA, some Members of Congress and scholars have debated whether the federated system is the most practical system for the presidential libraries. During the congressional debate surrounding the enactment of the PLA of 1986, for example, Senator Lawton Chiles feared the increasing size of the newer presidential libraries and thought that a single centralized library would prevent any attempts to build ever grander edifices. ", "At the same time, other Members of Congress argued that the architectural limitations on the library buildings penalized two-term Presidents because \"the final act that passed provided for no such distinctions\" between one- and two-term presidents, \"thereby essentially penalizing a two-term president whose records would require substantially more storage space.\" For example, Ms. Fawcett wrote in The Public Historian in 2006 that the William J. Clinton Presidential Library \"has almost no space for the growth of collections through donations or to house all the papers expected from President Clinton's active postpresidential life.\" She continued: \"Any substantial growth of the collections will require using off-site storage space.\"", "In the same 2006 edition of The Public Historian , Mr. Hackman argued that the federated system inhibits collaborative efforts among the presidential libraries\u2014\"beyond lending documents and artifacts.\" Mr. Hackman stated that such collaboration \"would make possible exhibits on important issues that cut across some or all presidencies, as most of them do, as well as offer an exhibit quality not ordinarily possible by a single library.\" According to Mr. Hackman, the exhibits would then be more balanced because they would offer a wider variety of perspectives on the topic or event. Creating a centralized presidential library, therefore, could mitigate any concerns about the balance of historical views in creating museum and library exhibits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Clarifying the Relationship Between the Foundation and the Federal Government", "paragraphs": ["As noted earlier, most presidential libraries currently have a partnership with a nonprofit foundation that supported construction of the library building and may continue to support the library through such activities as funding exhibitions. The relationship between the foundation and the library is different at each facility. Some foundations have relationships that Mr. Hackman said \"appear tense, even volatile at times,\" while others are \"smooth and settled.\" Ms. Fawcett also noted that some foundations \"support other institutions including associated schools of public affairs, policy, or service, and charitable causes of the former president.\" Some libraries' supporting foundations also maintain control of portions of the actual library facility and, in fact, inhabit the facility. According to Ms. Fawcett, for example, \"[t]he foundation-operated portions of the libraries have increased to include many public spaces once operated by the government, especially event venue space that can generate revenue for the foundation.\"", "Most major public and private museums now rely heavily on income from corporate and private use of event spaces. At the George H.W. Bush Library, the rotunda/lobby and museum store spaces are operated by the Bush Foundation. The Clinton Foundation owns the Great Hall, the off-site museum store, the caf\u00e9, and the verandas surrounding the Clinton Library. Libraries built before the amendments have also been reshaped by this new model. The Reagan Foundation owns the Air Force One Pavilion, which houses the plane that flew five presidents, and the museum store. The Nixon Foundation owns a stunning reproduction of the White House East Room. These public spaces were built to be available for a fee as event venues. Library foundations need these revenue sources to pay construction loans, to meet their commitments to provide continuing support for library programs, and in some cases, to support their other charitable endeavors.", "Additionally, Fawcett added, \"[w]ithout government support for their public programs and exhibits, the libraries are now much more dependent on their foundations for support.\" ", "In some cases, the library director, which is a government position, has concurrently served as the chief executive officer of the supporting foundation. Ms. Fawcett argued that this dual role \"helps to align foundation and government goals for the library.\" On the other hand, Mr. Hackman argued that \"little information is made available about these organizations [t]he foundations\u2014or even requested about them by the National Archives.\"", "Mr. Hackman argued that the relationships between the foundations and the libraries should be made more transparent\u2014\"to make certain that they operate effectively in the public's interest.\" Mr. Hackman noted that NARA's Office of Presidential Libraries has historically \"not gathered \u2026 lists of the boards of directors of these organizations or their annual reports or the reports they are required to file under federal statutes.\" Mr. Hackman said it is in the interest of NARA to obtain and \"report to the public information about the plans, activities, methods, and support of these organizations.\" To clarify the relationship between the foundations and NARA, Mr. Hackman outlined a series of desired characteristics for the partnership:", "Clarity in roles, goals, and priorities; responsibility; and authority in order to minimize friction and maximize success in the relationship between the presidential library and its nonprofit partners. Collaboration in annual and long-term planning, resource development, and budgeting so that all resources are used to achieve maximum impact. Dedication of financial support from the nonprofit partner to programs that address library priorities and that are highly unlikely to be supported from federal operations or library earned revenue. Library coordination of programs supported by the partner where these programs related to basic library functions including exhibitions, education, and, when possible, other programs for the public.

With nearly 2 million persons visiting presidential libraries in 2010, the estimated support to the communities that surround presidential libraries may be significant: $15 million estimated to be added to the economy in Abilene, Kansas; $43 million estimated in Boston; $55 million estimated in Austin, Texas. ", "After the hearing, Representatives John Mica and Rick Crawford hosted a forum on the future of the presidential library system that included officials from each of the presidential libraries that comprise the federal system. At that forum, Representative Crawford asked the library officials what steps they were taking to attract students and other young people to the libraries. Among the options that representatives from the libraries cited as attracting young people to the library was the use of social media and other technologies. ", "These statements are supported by CRS's examination of the libraries' use of different social media platforms. Table 2 includes information on presidential library use of Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. Currently, all 13 presidential libraries are using Facebook to communicate with the public. In addition, 10 libraries have independent Twitter accounts and 10 have YouTube channels. For libraries that were open prior to 2013, all but two of these accounts were established prior to 2012. The Truman, Kennedy, and Bush libraries have been active on all three platforms since 2010. ", "As shown in Table 2 , the popularity of each library on these platforms varies greatly. The Facebook page for the Ford Library, for example, has been \"liked\" fewer than 3,000 times, the lowest number of any NARA-affiliated presidential library. Conversely, the most popular page, which belongs to the George W. Bush Library, has been \"liked\" more than 170,000 times. Similar disparities were also found on both Twitter and YouTube, as indicated by the number of followers and subscribers in Table 2 . Regardless of their relative popularity, each of the 13 libraries has been active in their use of social media. At the time these data were collected, each of the Facebook pages had been updated with new content within the prior seven days, and four pages had been updated in the previous 24 hours. In addition, seven of the library Twitter accounts have posted more than 1,000 tweets since joining the network. For comparison purposes, Table 2 also includes data on the use of social media by the National Archives and Records Administration as a whole. NARA adopted social media use earlier than most of the presidential libraries, and has also generally generated a higher level of interest\u2014as measured by likes, followers, and subscribers.", "The presidential libraries use these social media platforms for a variety of purposes. A review of recent Facebook posts by the George Bush Library, the William J. Clinton Library, and the George W. Bush Library, for example, included messages related to", "administrative updates about the library, such as hours of operations or clarifications of policy; commemoration of important events, including national holidays such as Veterans Day, September 11, 2001, and the birthdays of important world leaders; current job openings at the library; events that will be taking place or have recently taken place at the library, including lectures, book signings, and exhibits; and historic moments that occurred during the applicable President's Administration.", "Both the testimony of Mr. Ferriero and the expanded use of social media likely indicate that the presidential library system has an interest in increased visitation and the presidential libraries are actively engaged in finding ways to attract more people to the libraries. Data provided by NARA, however, suggest that attracting visitors may still be a significant challenge. From FY1975 to FY2012, total visitors for all libraries have ranged between 1.1 million and 2.0 million visitors per year. At the beginning of this period, only 5 libraries were operating\u2014as opposed to the 12 in operation as of 2012. Figure 2 shows both the total visitors to the libraries per year as well as the number of visitors per library. While the number of total visitors has varied significantly across time, the number of visitors per open library has steadily declined. The average number of visitors for any given year in this period was 1.46 million. This total rose to more than 1.6 million for years in which a new presidential library opened (years marked separately in Table 2 ). ", "In the first year of operation, presidential libraries attract an average of 300,000 visitors. These numbers, however, typically decline over time. Five years after opening, visitation at the average presidential library declines by more than 36%. The decline in visitors is 43% when looking at visitation across a 10-year time period, with two particular libraries' visitation totals declining by more than 60% in a decade. ", "Attendance levels vary across the library system. Among the 12 libraries that were open in FY2012, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library had the highest number of visitors, with 381,000. Six of the libraries, however, had a total number of visitors below 100,000. As a comparison, the National Archives and Records Administration facility in Washington, DC, has drawn roughly 1 million visitors per year since 2004. ", "The relative popularity of each library is difficult to explain in terms of either how recently the President served or the geographic location of the facility. While library attendance tends to decline over time, no evidence suggests that newer libraries are more visited over time. For instance, the Gerald R. Ford Library and Museum has consistently maintained more visitors than the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum in recent years, despite the Ford library's opening more than five years earlier. Additionally, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library had a resurgence in annual visitors in the early 2000s and has drawn more visitors since that time than either the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum or the William J. Clinton Presidential Library and Museum. ", "A recent study conducted on behalf of the University of Chicago suggested that a prospective library to hold the records of President Obama located in Chicago would draw as many as 800,000 visitors per year, which is a visitation figure much higher than visitation levels at any current facility. Part of the rationale for this figure was that a library located in a more densely populated area with access to public transportation would generate a high number of visitors. Existing data on visitation to presidential libraries, however, suggest this is not always the case. As demonstrated by Table 3 , many of the facilities that are located in densely populated areas, such as the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum and the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum, did not draw a relatively high number of visitors for FY2012. At the same time, the William J. Clinton Presidential Library and Museum and Dwight D. Eisenhower Library drew more visitors despite locations that are more sparsely populated. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Policy Options for Congress", "paragraphs": ["The National Archives and Records Administration currently oversees 13 separate presidential libraries, which serve as repositories for presidential archival materials. Since enacted in 1955, the Presidential Libraries Act has provided for the preservation and administration of the historical materials of an outgoing President by authorizing the federal government to accept land, buildings, and other materials. A private nonprofit organization funded the construction of each presidential repository and provided the required endowment. Almost every library is associated with that nonprofit, which often supports library and presidential museum exhibitions. As this report has noted, the Presidential Libraries Act has placed various requirements on both libraries and foundations to assist in the preservation of presidential legacies. Congress has the authority to legislate the mission and operation of all of the presidential libraries. Congress may choose to clarify the best method of preserving a President's legacy\u2014by creating accurate and balanced exhibits on the presidency and each Administration or by providing a user-friendly repository of each President's records.", "Congress may determine that the current operation of presidential libraries should continue, and that foundations should continue to fund and oversee the creation of public museum exhibits. NARA has final approval of all exhibit content, but the foundations, in many cases, have assumed control of creating the public exhibit portions of the libraries. Congress, however, may determine that NARA should play a more active role in the creation and display of library exhibitions. With greater control, NARA could coordinate exhibits among the 13 current libraries and, possibly, offer a more thorough and balanced treatment of the presidency as an institution as well as the historical context of each individual presidential Administration.", "Congress may also reconsider having a disparate collection of presidential libraries around the country. Congress could determine that having all historical presidential materials in one location is a less expensive and more accessible option than operating 13 or more distinct libraries. Congress would face a determination of what to do with library buildings the United States currently owns that would no longer be used as repositories. Congress would also face the question of funding the construction and use of a single facility. ", "Moving all materials into a single facility could have implications for scholarship on presidential history. On the one hand, a consolidation of the records would make the total collection of presidential materials easily accessible to researchers that would previously have had to visit different locations, such as those creating comparative work. Such a change, however, could also make research more difficult by removing the records from a location that was relevant to the hometown or upbringing of that President. If a new single archive for presidential materials were constructed in Washington, DC, then researchers living in California who had interest in materials on Richard Nixon may have to travel across the country instead of to Yorba Linda (the current location of the Richard Nixon Library) to access them\u2014or a scholar living in Kansas may have to leave the Midwest to learn more about Dwight D. Eisenhower. Additionally, the current system disperses the economic benefits of these facilities to 13 towns and cities around the country. A consolidated approach would remove this benefit to local communities. ", "Keeping the presidential libraries in the hometowns of the presidents may, arguably, help scholars better understand the environmental and social factors that shaped a President's earlier years and influenced his decisions. The construction of library facilities outside the hometowns of the Presidents themselves, as was the case with the repository for George W. Bush in Dallas, TX, could undermine this justification for a dispersed library system. Congress, therefore, may have an interest in requiring the construction of future presidential libraries in the hometown of the President. On the other hand, the location of presidential materials may become increasingly irrelevant as the records of earlier former Presidents are put online and a majority of the records of more recent Presidents are electronic, making all presidential records more accessible to researchers no matter their location.", "One centralized presidential archive could eliminate the need to replicate certain resources that are essential to a records repository. For example, moving all presidential records into one facility run exclusively by NARA would eliminate the need for each individual presidential library to have a specialized facility to protect classified presidential documents. Currently, each presidential library has had to construct and maintain facilities for such sensitive materials. Other services that may currently be required in each library are technology services and security personnel. Moving the materials into a central library, however, could render them susceptible to destruction by a single fire, flood, or other disaster. Additionally, construction of a centralized library could influence the type of research that scholars conduct. Research may focus on the institution of the presidency, as a whole, rather than on the individual Presidents.", "Congress may also be concerned about the relationship between the presidential libraries and the library foundations that provide financial support. Congress has the authority to legislate whether one person can or should concurrently hold a position in the federal government and an unpaid position within the supporting organization. Such an arrangement may make certain that the foundation and NARA have similar missions and ideas about the future of the entities. On the other hand, Congress may determine that one person holding a position in both the foundation and NARA may present a conflict of interest in which the person could advance private-sector preferences over the interests of the federal government.", "To reduce the public costs associated with presidential libraries, Congress has the authority to legislate the percentage of the required endowment to accompany the deeding of any presidential library facility. Congress may determine that the current required endowment to accompany the deeding over of a presidential library to the federal government (60%) should be raised, lowered, or maintained at its current level.", "As this report has suggested, the federal presidential libraries and their private funding sources typically fulfill different roles. Because of the varied and unique relationships between the libraries and foundations, however, the precise division of labor and property is sometimes unclear. In addition, as noted previously, relatively little information about private funding sources must be publicly disclosed. If the various funding relationships among public and private sources are a concern, Congress could mandate public disclosure of additional information about funding, division of duties, or office space. In recent Congresses, legislation that would amend fundraising for presidential libraries has been introduced. H.R. 1133 (113 th Congress), for example, would have required library fundraising organizations to file quarterly reports itemizing contributions totaling at least $200. Under the bill, the reports would have been filed with NARA. Pursuant to H.R. 1133 , the Archivist would then have been required within 30 days to publish certain information from these quarterly reports on a publicly accessible website. H.R. 1133 was reported by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and placed on the Union Calendar on June 20, 2013. No further action was taken on the bill.", "NARA, in its report on presidential libraries, suggested a possible alternative to the current libraries system that would require foundations to provide the government with a library-only building and \"no museum component.\" Any museum associated with the corresponding President could be placed \"in the same general vicinity,\" but the facility would be separate and distinct from the library. Removing the foundation from the library facility could clarify to visitors what is privately owned space and what is publicly owned.", "Finally, the presidential libraries and museums often charge visitors an admission fee. In some cases, this fee is then divided between the federal government and the foundation. This fee division, however, is not always made clear to visitors. In some libraries, the foundations pay the federal government for access to federal government-owned portions of the library facility. At the Reagan and Clinton libraries, for example, each foundation pays the federal government a per-person fee after it holds events at which attendees are given free access to the library's museum. In addition to collecting fees from foundations in certain circumstances, Congress has the authority to require NARA to clearly identify to visitors what portion of their fees go to the federal government and what portion does not. Congress also has the authority to enact legislation that would allow visitors to pay only for access to the areas of the library or museum that interest them. Regardless of ownership of that portion of the facility, the visitor would pay only for those parts of the facility visited.

As a result, the issues that have garnered congressional attention in the past\u2014including private financing, the historic role of the libraries, and the delineation between private and public functions\u2014will likely continue as potential areas of interest as successive library facilities are opened under NARA management and congressional oversight."], "subsections": []}]}}
