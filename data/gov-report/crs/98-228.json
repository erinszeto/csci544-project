Representatives will call out \"aye\" or \"no\" when a question is first put by the Speaker or Speaker pro tempore. As Rule I, clause 6, states, the Speaker will say, \"Those in favor [of the question], say 'Aye.'\" Then the Speaker will ask: \"Those opposed, say 'No.'\" Following the response, the Speaker states that, in his or her opinion, \"the ayes [or the noes] appear to have it.\" There is no record of how an individual Member votes on a voice vote.

Like a voice vote, this procedure does not provide a public record of how each Member voted. Rule XX, clause 1(a), states that if the Speaker is uncertain about the outcome of a voice vote, or if a Member demands a division, the House shall divide. \"Those in favor of the question shall first rise from their seats to be counted,\" and then those who are opposed to the proposition shall stand to be counted. Only vote totals (95 for, 65 against, for instance) are announced in this method of voting.

If it is evident to a lawmaker that a quorum is not present in the chamber, he or she may object to a voice vote on that ground. Assuming the chair sustains the point of order, the chair will order a yea and nay vote. To make a quorum point of order, a Member says, \"I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present, and I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\" The actual vote will then simultaneously determine both issues: the presence of a quorum and the vote on the pending question. ", "In addition, clause 10 of Rule XX states that the \"yeas and nays shall be considered as ordered\" on final passage of a limited number of measures or matters, such as concurrent budget resolutions.

", "If few Members are present in the chamber, a lawmaker who plans to request a recorded vote will usually say, \"Mr. [or Madam] Chair, I request a recorded vote and, pending that, I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\" (A quorum in the Committee of the Whole is 100 Members, Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner.)
