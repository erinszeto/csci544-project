The Trump Administration proposed to reduce FER&D funding substantially in its FY2018 and FY2019 budget requests, but Congress has not agreed to the proposed reductions. In FY2018, Congress increased funding for DOE FER&D by nearly $59 million (9%) compared to FY2017, and the House- and Senate-passed appropriations bills for FY2019 would match or increase the appropriated amount compared to what Congress enacted for FY2018 ($727 million).", "The Petra Nova plant in Texas is the only U.S. fossil-fueled power plant currently generating electricity and capturing CO2 in large quantities (over 1 million tons per year). Globally, the Boundary Dam plant in Canada is the only other large-scale fossil-fueled power plant with CCS. Both facilities retrofitted post-combustion capture technology to units of existing plants, and both offset a portion of the cost of CCS by selling captured CO2 for the purpose of enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Some CCS proponents point to the expanded Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code tax credits for CO2 capture and sequestration or its use as a tertiary injectant for EOR or natural gas production that were enacted as part of P.L. 115-123 as a significant step toward incentivizing more development of large-scale CCS deployment like Petra Nova and Boundary Dam.", "A number of bills introduced in the 115th Congress potentially would affect CCS in the United States.

H.R. 1892, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, enacted into law as P.L. 115-123, amended Section 45Q and increased the amount of the tax credit from $20 to $50 per ton of CO2 for permanent sequestration, increased it from $10 to $35 for EOR purposes, and effectively removed the 75 million ton cap on the total amount of CO2 injected underground, among other changes. Some proponents suggest that enactment of this provision could be a \"game changer\" for CCS, leading to more widespread adoption of the technology, although others question whether the increased incentives are large enough to affect CCS deployment.", "Other bills address a suite of measures to advance CCS. Several would provide additional financial incentives, such as tax-exempt private activity bonds, and provisions that would enable eligibility of master limited partnerships for CCS infrastructure projects (S. 843, S. 2005, H.R. 2011, and H.R. 4118). One bill (S. 2602) could help advance CCS by making CCS infrastructure projects eligible under the FAST Act (42 U.S.C. 4370m(6)). Other bills (S. 2803, S. 2997, H.R. 2296, H.R. 5745) would support increased R&D for CCS, carbon utilization technologies, and direct air capture of CO2.

Currently, approximately 4,500 miles of pipelines transport CO 2 in the United States, predominately to oil fields, where it is used for EOR. Transporting CO 2 in pipelines is similar to transporting fuels such as natural gas and oil; it requires attention to design, monitoring for leaks, and protection against overpressure, especially in populated areas. Typically, CO 2 would be compressed prior to transportation into a supercritical state, making it dense like a liquid but fluid like a gas. ", "Using ships may be feasible when CO 2 must be transported over large distances or overseas. Liquefied natural gas, propane, and butane are routinely shipped by marine tankers on a large scale worldwide. Ships transport CO 2 today, but at a small scale because of limited demand.

The quantity and distance transported will mostly determine costs, which also will depend on whether the pipeline is onshore or offshore; the level of congestion along the route; and whether mountains, large rivers, or frozen ground are encountered. Shipping costs are unknown in any detail, because no large-scale CO 2 transport system via ship (in millions of tons of CO 2 per year, for example) is operating. Ship costs might be lower than pipeline transport for distances greater than 1,000 kilometers and for less than a few million tons of CO 2 transported per year.", "Even though regional CO 2 pipeline networks currently operate in the United States for EOR, developing a more expansive network for CCS could pose regulatory and economic challenges. Some observers note that development of a national CO 2 pipeline network that would address the broader issue of greenhouse gas reduction using CCS may require a concerted federal policy beyond the current joint federal-state regulatory policy.

When CO 2 is injected at depths greater than about half a mile (800 meters) in a typical reservoir, the pressure keeps the injected CO 2 supercritical, making the CO 2 less likely to migrate out of the geological formation. The process also requires that the geological formation have an overlying caprock or relatively impermeable formation, such as shale, so that injected CO2 remains trapped underground ( Figure 1 ). Injecting CO 2 into deep geological formations uses existing technologies that have been primarily developed and used by the oil and gas industry and that potentially could be adapted for long-term storage and monitoring of CO 2 .

It is currently in the development phase. The development phase includes implementation of large-scale field testing of approximately 1 million tons of CO 2 per project to confirm the safety, permanence, and economics of industrial-scale CO 2 storage in seven different regions of the United States. The development phase began in 2008 and is projected to last through 2018 and possibly beyond.", "The storage capacity for CO 2 in geological formations is potentially huge if all the sedimentary basins in the world are considered. In the United States alone, DOE has estimated the total storage capacity to range between about 2.6 trillion and 22 trillion tons of CO 2 (see Table 1 ). The suitability of any particular site, however, depends on many factors, including proximity to CO 2 sources and other reservoir-specific qualities such as porosity, permeability, and potential for leakage. For CCS to succeed, it is assumed that each reservoir type would permanently store the vast majority of injected CO 2 , keeping the gas isolated from the atmosphere in perpetuity. That assumption is untested, although part of the DOE CCS R&D program has been devoted to experimenting and modeling the behavior of large quantities of injected CO 2 . Theoretically\u2014and without consideration of costs, regulatory issues, public acceptance, infrastructure needs, liability, ownership, and other issues\u2014the United States could store its total CO 2 emissions from large stationary sources (at the current rate of emissions) for centuries.

H.R. 1892 , the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, was enacted into law as P.L. 115-123 . The provisions of P.L. 115-123 that amended Section 45Q and their implications are discussed in more detail in the text box below.", "Other bills also would amend the Internal Revenue Code in ways affecting CCS. For example, S. 843 and H.R. 2011 would amend Section 142 of the Internal Revenue Code to allow qualified CO 2 capture facilities that capture 65% or more of their CO 2 emissions to be eligible for tax-exempt private activity bonds. The bills assert that ", "allowing tax-exempt financing for the purchase of capital equipment that is used to capture carbon dioxide will reduce the costs of developing carbon dioxide capture projects, accelerate their deployment, and, in conjunction with carbon dioxide utilization and long-term storage, help the United States meet critical environmental, economic, and national security goals.", "Several bills would address federal efforts to enhance CCS or emphasize different aspects of the process across three different federal agency and departmental jurisdictions: EPA, DOE, and the Department of Agriculture. S. 2602 , for example, would authorize activities under EPA jurisdiction to support direct air capture and utilization of CO 2 , and would include carbon capture infrastructure projects as eligible under the FAST Act, as part of the bill's intent to expedite the permitting process for CCS. The legislation would add CCS infrastructure projects explicitly as eligible covered projects, meaning any infrastructure construction activity requiring authorization or environmental review by a federal agency.", "S. 2803 and H.R. 5745 would amend the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-58 ) to authorize DOE to further its CCS research, development, and deployment (RD&D) activities, and place a greater emphasis on CO 2 utilization. S. 2803 would also authorize a project aimed to achieve net-negative CO 2 emissions\u2014projects utilizing biomass and fossil fuels to produce electricity, fuels, or chemicals\u2014with a net removal of CO 2 from the atmosphere. S. 2997 would authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to pursue biomass-related CCS R&D projects, and would authorize the use of loans or loan guarantees for biomass-related CO 2 capture and utilization activities. H.R. 2296 would focus on DOE CCS-related activities and require the department to evaluate its RD&D projects and make recommendations whether each project should continue to receive funding based on progress toward its CCS goals.

The Boundary Dam power plant in Canada is the only other commercial fossil-fueled electricity generating plant in the world operating with CCS and capturing a nearly equivalent volume of CO 2 . Both plants offset a portion of the cost of CCS by selling CO 2 for the purpose of enhanced oil recovery. Some CCS proponents have hailed the expanded tax credit provision enacted as part of P.L. 115-123 , increasing the value of tax credits under Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code, as a potential \"game changer\" for incentivizing more development of large-scale CCS deployment like Petra Nova and Boundary Dam.", "Some CCS proponents advocate for other incentives, such as tax-exempt private activity bonds, and enabling eligibility of master limited partnerships for CCS infrastructure projects, which could also increase the financial attractiveness of large-scale capital-intensive CCS endeavors. According to CCS proponents, private activity bonds would allow CCS project developers access to tax-exempt debt, thus lowering their capital costs. Master limited partnerships would allow a corporate structure to combine the tax benefits of a partnership with a corporation's ability to raise capital, reducing the cost of equity and providing access to capital on more favorable terms, according to proponents.", "Members of Congress have introduced legislation that would authorize these financial incentives, as well as a suite of other bills aimed at advancing CCS by making CCS infrastructure projects eligible under the FAST Act (42 U.S.C. 4370m(6)), supporting increased research and development for conventional CCS and for carbon utilization technologies and direct air capture of CO 2 . Several bills would authorize technology prizes for advances in CCS R&D, including for utilization technologies and direct air capture.", "P.L. 115-123 was enacted on February 9, 2018, and it likely will take time to evaluate the impact on U.S. CCS activities. Other factors, such as the price of oil, which could affect demand for EOR and thus CO 2 , and the price of natural gas\u2014which could affect the substitution of natural gas for coal in electricity production\u2014will also shape the extent and rapidity of CCS adoption as well. Enactment of other legislation introduced in the 115 th Congress ( Appendix ) that would provide additional incentives for CCS could also influence future CCS activities.", "Ultimately the success of legislative approaches advocated by bill sponsors, and more broadly by CCS proponents, will be measured by how those approaches reduce costs for CCS, through financial incentives, technology development, and commercially viable CO 2 -based products, so that the suite of CCS technologies would be more broadly deployed. Absent a policy mandate for reducing CO 2 emissions, or rewarding CO 2 capture and storage or utilization (apart from the 45Q tax incentives enacted in P.L. 115-123 ), there is broad agreement that costs for CCS would need to decrease before the technologies are commercially deployed across the nation. ", "The issue of greater CCS deployment is fundamental to the underlying reason CCS is deemed important by a range of proponents: to reduce CO 2 emissions (or reduce the concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere) and help mitigate against human-induced climate change. The conventional concept of CCS whereby CO 2 emissions from large stationary sources in the United States, such as fossil fuel electricity generating plants, refineries, cement plants, and others was recognized early on as a potential pathway to reducing a large amount greenhouse gas emissions from a relatively small number of point sources. The U.S. fossil fuel electricity generation sector alone emitted 1.8 billion tons of CO 2 in 2016, or 34% of total U.S. CO 2 emissions (5.31 billion tons) that year.", "The emerging technologies for utilizing CO 2 for a variety of uses and products (carbon utilization, see Figure 5 ) has energized some CCS advocates because of the commercial potential and prospects for the sequestration of CO 2 in long-lasting products such as cements and plastics. A challenge for utilization advocates is whether the market for carbon utilization products and uses is sufficiently large so that the amount of CO 2 captured or removed from the atmosphere has some measurable effect on human-induced climate change.", "Direct air capture (DAC) also has energized some CCS advocates as it offers the promise of net-negative carbon removal if the CO 2 removed by DAC is permanently stored or sequestered. The challenge for DAC is fairly straightforward\u2014how to reduce the cost per ton of CO 2 removed. "], "subsections": []}]}}
