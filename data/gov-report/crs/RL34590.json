The Administration argues that the growing costs of Defense health care, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of the defense budget, require efforts to seek greater contributions by users. It argues that inasmuch as Tricare Prime enrollment fees were set in 1995 and have not been raised since, it is reasonable that they should be increased. Congress has thus far refused to give DOD the requested authority to raise the fees.", "Discussion: The health care portion of the Defense budget has grown from $19 billion in FY2001 to over $42 billion in FY2008. Since 2006 DOD has been attempting to raise co-payment and enrollment fees for retired military personnel and their dependents who are not eligible for Medicare. (Medicare-eligible retirees can use the Tricare for Life program which would not be affected by the proposed fee increases.) DOD asserts that retirees using Tricare Prime paid approximately 27 percent of their health care costs in 1995 but now pay only 12 percent. Consistent with recommendations of the Department of Defense Task Force on the Future of Military Health Care, the proposed DOD budget for FY2009 would have gradually raised enrollment fees for those using Tricare Prime, the HMO-like option, from the current $460 (self+dependents) to 2011 rates as high as $1,750 for retirees making over $40,000 annually. DOD also proposed creating an enrollment fee for retirees who use Tricare Standard, the fee-for-service option, of $120 per year. In addition, DOD maintains that retail prescription usage and costs have contributed significantly to the growth in health care spending and recommended increases in pharmacy co-payments (along with eliminating co-payments for pharmaceuticals provided by the DOD Mail Order Pharmacy). According to DOD, these fee increases would save some $1.2 billion in FY2009. Opposition from beneficiary organizations has been strong and the Government Accountability Office concluded in May 2007 that DOD's estimates of cost savings were over-estimated. Congress has twice denied DOD authority to increase Tricare fees in FY2007 and FY2008, and has encouraged DOD to find other approaches to restraining the growth of the health care budget.", "Reference(s): CRS Report RS22402, Increases in Tricare Costs: Background and Options for Congress.

Reagan National Defense Authorization Act ( P.L. 108-375 ) established the Tricare Reserve Select program which permitted some drilling reserve personnel to utilize Tricare but required that they pay enrollment fees interpreted to be equivalent to the 28 percent charged to Federal civil servants under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). The FY2007 John Warner National Defense Authorization Act ( P.L. 109-364 ) extended the benefit to all drilling reservists. In December 2007 the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the premiums DOD established had actually exceeded the costs of providing the Tricare benefit.", "Discussion: Tricare Reserve Select (TRS) provides a health care benefit to reservists who are in drilling status and not on active duty. (Reservists called to active duty have regular Tricare benefits that have no enrollment fees.) Current monthly premiums are $81/self or $253/self+family. Enrollment in TRS has been lower than estimated, suggesting that premium rates discourage selection or that reservists have access to more affordable civilian health care options. A GAO report published in December 2007 concluded that the premiums DOD established exceeded the reported average cost of providing care through TRS. This situation resulted, according to GAO, from DOD having used FEHBP Blue Cross/Blue Shield rates as benchmarks that in practice proved to be higher than necessary to cover DOD's costs. GAO recommended that DOD base premiums on actual costs and DOD has indicated its support for that approach consistent with available cost data.", "Reference(s): GAO Report Military Health Care: Cost Data Indicate that TRICARE Reserve Select Premiums Exceeded the Costs of Providing Program Benefits, GAO-08-104, December 2007 http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08104.pdf .", "CRS Point of Contact (POC): Dick Best, x[phone number scrubbed]."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Active Duty End Strengths", "paragraphs": ["Background: Continuing combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have stressed the nation's armed forces, especially the Army and Marine Corps.
