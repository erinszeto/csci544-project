Industry has been assessing asset criticality under the current securityguidance, but TSA plans to publish a new multi-modal (including pipelines) model providing aclearer basis for identifying assets that might be subject to terrorist attacks. The model accounts forpotential loss of human life and well-being (e.g., illness, access to emergency services),reconstitution, economic impact, and symbolic importance. TSA expects assessments to beconducted initially within each transportation mode, with final assessments across all transportationmodes. TSA intends to use the model results for allocating resources to protect the highest priorityassets across different modes of transportation. TSA's Pipeline Branch has been developing, andplans to maintain in the future, its own inventory of critical pipeline infrastructure based on thismodel.

According to TSA staff, the model should evaluate operator security plans based on a set ofpre-determined relevant and realistic \"attack scenarios.\" For pipelines, these scenarios specify avariety of physical and cyber-attacks to the network, including attacks incorporating chemical andbiological agents. By applying one model across transportation modes, TSA seeks to establish amore consistent approach to assessing vulnerability than mode-specific models might provide.

Criticality assessment and risk analysis are still evolving, so the basis for prioritizing one set ofpipelines over another for security purposes is debatable.
