The President's proposed FY2011 R&D funding included an emphasis on increasing funding for the physical sciences and engineering, an effort consistent with the intent of the America COMPETES Act ( P.L. 110-69 ) and President Bush's American Competitiveness Initiative (ACI).

President Obama did not provide details on how this goal might be achieved (e.g., how much would be funded through increases in direct federal R&D funding or through indirect mechanisms such as the research and experimentation tax credit ); however doing so likely would require a substantial increase in public and private investment. In 2007, total U.S. R&D expenditures were $397.629 billion, or approximately 2.75% of GDP. Based on 2008 figures, reaching President Obama's 3% goal would have required a 8.96% real (above inflation) increase in national R&D funding. Increasing direct federal R&D funding by 8.96% in FY2011 would have required an increase of $12.9 billion above President Obama's request.", "In addition, advocates for increased federal R&D funding\u2014including President Obama's science advisor, John Holdren\u2014have raised concerns about the potential harm of a \"boom-bust\" approach to federal R&D funding (i.e., rapid growth in federal R&D funding followed by much slower growth, flat funding, or even decline). The biomedical research community experienced a variety of challenges resulting from such a circumstance following the five-year doubling of the NIH budget that was completed in FY2003. With the NIH doubling came a rapid expansion of the nation's biomedical research infrastructure (e.g., buildings, laboratories, equipment), as well as rapid growth in university faculty hiring, students pursuing biomedical degrees, and grant applications to NIH. After the doubling, however, the agency's budget fell each year in real terms from FY2004 to FY2009. Critics assert a variety of damages of this boom-bust cycle, including interruptions and cancellations of promising research, declining share in the number of NIH grant proposals funded, decreased student interest in pursuing graduate studies, and reduced employment prospects for the large number of biomedical researchers with advanced degrees. According to then-NIH Director Elias Zerhouni, the damages have been particularly acute for early- and mid-career scientists seeking a first or second grant.", "Analysis of federal R&D funding is complicated by several factors, including the Obama Administration's omission of congressionally directed spending from the FY2011 budget request and inconsistency among agencies in the reporting of R&D. Another complicating factor for FY2009 and FY2010 is the inclusion of funding for R&D, facilities, and equipment, and related activities in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ). ARRA funds supplement funding provided to agencies in P.L. 110-329 and P.L. 111-8 .

Three years later, with enacted funding levels for FY2008-FY2010 below those authorized in P.L. 110-69 , Congress passed the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 establishing authorization levels for FY2011-FY2013 for the target accounts at a growth rate consistent with a 10-year doubling path. In FY2011 supporting budget documents, President Obama extended his target for doubling to 11 years (FY2006-FY2017).

Ensuring adequate support for S&T activities is seen by some in the defense community as imperative to maintaining U.S. military superiority. This was of particular concern at a time when defense budgets and RDT&E funding were falling at the end of the Cold War.

A proposed reduction of $39 million for the Infrastructure and Geophysical Division included the termination of local and regional initiatives previously established or funded at congressional direction. The request for Laboratory Facilities included no funds for the planned National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF), which received $32 million in FY2010, but DHS stated that it planned to request a reprogramming of unobligated prior-year funds to support construction of a utility plant at the NBAF site. The final appropriation was $767 million: $828 million in new funds and a rescission of $60 million remaining unobligated from prior years. For the most part, Congress did not specify how the final appropriation should be allocated to particular programs.", "The construction of NBAF will likely require significant increases in Laboratory Facilities funding over the next several years. It may also result in increased congressional oversight. For construction of NBAF and decommissioning of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC), which NBAF is intended to replace, DHS expects to need further appropriations of $691 million between FY2012 and FY2017. The estimated total federal cost of the NBAF project increased from $451 million in December 2006 to $615 million in May 2009. Additional site-specific infrastructure and utility upgrade costs of $110 million are to be contributed in-kind by Kansas State University and its partners. Decommissioning PIADC is expected to cost another $190 million. These estimated costs have not changed since May 2009, but the completion schedule has been extended by one year because the process of selling Plum Island is taking longer than DHS had planned. In the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2009 ( P.L. 110-329 , Div. D, \u00a7540) and the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2010 ( P.L. 111-83 , \u00a7540), Congress authorized DHS to use receipts from the sale of Plum Island, subject to appropriation, to offset NBAF construction and PIADC decommissioning costs. The final FY2011 appropriation continued this authorization from the FY2010 act.", "Congress has been interested for several years in DHS policies and procedures for testing and evaluation (T&E) of large acquisition projects. This interest has especially focused on the T&E role of the S&T Directorate in acquisitions by other DHS components. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-296 , \u00a7306) authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Under Secretary for Science and Technology, to \"issue necessary regulations with respect to ... testing and evaluation activities of the Department.\" Under current DHS policy, in establishing T&E policies and procedures for DHS acquisitions, the Under Secretary acts through the Director of the S&T Directorate's Test and Evaluation and Standards Division (TSD) and a special assistant in the TSD known as the Director of Operational Testing and Evaluation (DOT&E). Congressional oversight of DHS acquisition and T&E may therefore focus attention on the S&T Directorate's funding for Test and Evaluation and Standards.", "Statutory authority for the Homeland Security Institute (HSI) expired in April 2009. Under its general authority to establish federally funded R&D centers, the S&T Directorate has replaced HSI with the Homeland Security Studies and Analysis Institute (HSSAI). It has also established a new Homeland Security Systems Engineering and Development Institute (HSSEDI). Both institutes are funded mostly on a cost-reimbursement basis by other S&T programs and other DHS and non-DHS agencies. The institutes attracted outside users in FY2009 at only about one-third the level that DHS had anticipated. Nevertheless, DHS expects them to grow rapidly in FY2010 and continue growing in FY2011. The FY2011 budget justification projected reimbursable obligations of $187 million in FY2011, more than four times the FY2009 level of $42 million.", "The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) is the primary DHS organization for combating the threat of nuclear attack. It is responsible for all DHS nuclear detection development, testing, evaluation, acquisition, and operational support. Under the Administration's FY2011 budget, DNDO's research role was to be transferred to the S&T Directorate. The Administration requested a total of $306 million for DNDO for FY2011. This was a 20% decrease from the FY2010 appropriation. Excluding the proposed transfer of the Transformational R&D program, the request for the remaining DNDO activities was a 12% increase. In some cases, however, the request proposed substantial shifts in emphasis. The request for Systems Acquisition included $53 million for human-portable radiation detection systems, versus none in FY2010. The request for Systems Development was reduced by $31 million. The final appropriation provided $331 million for DNDO: $342 million in new funds and a rescission of $11 million remaining unobligated from prior years. Congress did not specify how the final appropriation should be allocated to programs below the account level.", "Congressional attention has focused in recent years on the testing and analysis DNDO has conducted to support its planned purchase and deployment of Advanced Spectroscopic Portals (ASPs), a type of next-generation radiation portal monitor. Congress has included a requirement for secretarial certification before full-scale ASP procurement in each homeland security appropriations act from FY2007 through FY2010. The expected date for certification has been postponed several times. In February 2010, DHS decided that it would no longer pursue the use of ASPs for primary screening, although it will continue developing and testing them for use in secondary screening. The final FY2011 appropriation continued the certification requirement from the FY2010 act.", "The global nuclear detection architecture overseen by DNDO remains an issue of congressional interest. According to the FY2011 budget justification, the proposed reduction in funding for Systems Development reflected \"a shift in DNDO priorities to developing a wider range of potential solutions to enduring vulnerabilities in the global nuclear detection architecture\" and would result in increased funding for \"systems studies, as well as testing and piloting existing technologies in new operational environments.\" Congress may wish to consider the basis for and implications of these changes in priorities, including how they may affect other elements of the global architecture. Other agencies with a role in the architecture, in addition to DHS, include the DOD, DOE, Department of Justice, Department of State, and the intelligence community.", "The mission of DNDO, as established by Congress in the SAFE Port Act ( P.L. 109-347 , Title V), includes serving as the primary federal entity \"to further develop, acquire, and support the deployment of an enhanced domestic system\" for detection of nuclear and radiological devices and material (6 U.S.C. 592). The act also eliminated any explicit mention of radiological and nuclear countermeasures from the statutory duties and responsibilities of the Under Secretary for S&T. Congress may consider whether the proposed transfer of DNDO's research activities to the S&T Directorate is consistent with congressional intent in the SAFE Port Act. Congress may also choose to consider the acquisition portion of DNDO's mission. Most of DNDO's funding for Systems Acquisition was eliminated in FY2010, and that year's budget stated that \"funding requests for radiation detection equipment will now be sought by the end users that will operate them.\" In contrast, the FY2011 request for Systems Acquisition included more funding than ever before for DNDO's procurement of human-portable radiation detectors on behalf of the Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, and the Transportation Security Administration.

Those two bills provide NIH's discretionary budget authority. In addition, NIH receives mandatory funding of $150 million annually that is provided in the Public Health Service (PHS) Act for a special program on diabetes research, and $8.2 million annually for the National Library of Medicine from a transfer within PHS. Each year since FY2002, Congress has provided that a portion of NIH's Labor/HHS appropriation be transferred to the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The transfer, usually $300 million annually, is part of the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund. The total funding available for NIH activities, taking account of add-ons and transfers, is the program level.

The program focuses on the pre-clinical stage of drug development in partnership with the private sector. The Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) program would have increased to a total of $500 million in support of a consortium of 60 academic health centers doing collaborative research and training. Cancer researchers planned the initiation of 30 new drug trials in FY2011 and a doubling of the number of novel compounds in Phase 1-3 clinical trials by 2016.

A trans-NIH initiative called the Basic Behavioral and Social Sciences Opportunity Network (OppNet) was started in FY2010 with ARRA funds. It aims to enhance the understanding of fundamental mechanisms of behavioral and social functioning to develop new approaches for reducing risky behaviors and improving health. The FY2011 request proposed a $20 million investment in OppNet, shared 50/50 between OD and support from all the ICs.", "Global Health. In addition to the Global Fund transfer (discussed above), NIH has long supported research on worldwide health threats. As part of the Obama Administration's Global Health Initiative, the FY2011 budget proposed increased emphasis on researching prevention, diagnostics, and therapeutics for neglected diseases in the developing world. NIH works in partnership with other funding organizations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

The act would have provided R&D funding for DOT agencies of approximately $1,013.1 million, roughly equal to the FY2010 and request levels. ", "The 111 th Congress did not complete action on the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2011, or any of the other FY2011 appropriations bills. In April 2011, the 112 th Congress passed the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 ( P.L. 112-10 ) providing FY2011 funding for all federal agencies, including the Department of Transportation. In general, the law appropriates funds to the agencies at the FY2010 level unless otherwise specified. In particular, the law reduces the FAA's RE&D account by $20.5 million to $170 million in FY2011. This would reduce total FAA funding from $412 million in FY2010 to approximately $391 million in FY2011. The bill also reduces DOT's Planning, Research and Development account by $6 million from its FY2010 funding level. The level of detail in the law, however, does not allow for a complete assessment of how the specified changes will affect overall agency and departmental R&D funding for FY2011. This report will be updated as more information becomes available from the department, agencies, or Congressional committees. (See Table 18 .)"], "subsections": []}]}}
