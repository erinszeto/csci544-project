This act authorizes advance appropriations for three mandatory VA benefits programs within the Veterans Benefits Administration: compensation and pensions, readjustment benefits, and veterans insurance and indemnities.

On August 7, 2014, President Obama signed the bill into law. The act, as amended, makes a number of changes to programs and policies of the VHA that aim to increase access and lower wait times for veterans who seek care at VA facilities. Among other things, the act establishes a new program (the Veterans Choice Program) that would allow the VA to authorize care for veterans outside the VA health care system if they meet certain criteria. Congress also provided mandatory funding for the Choice Program, with a total of $10 billion over three years by establishing the Veterans Choice Fund (Section 802 (a) of P.L. 113-146 as amended). Since it was estimated that not all the funds in the Veterans Choice Fund would be exhausted by August 7, 2017, on April 19, 2017, President Trump signed into law P.L. 115-26 (an act to amend the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 to modify the termination date for the Veterans Choice Program, and for other purposes) and eliminated the sunset date of the Veterans Choice Program and allowed any unobligated funds in the Veterans Choice Fund to be used until expended. However, in mid-June 2017, VA notified Congress that due to the increased authorization of appointments, there had been higher rate of usage of VCP funds and VCP would not be able to continue past August 15, 2017, since all the remaining funds for VCP would be fully obligated by then. According to the VA, at least $3.5 billion in new mandatory budget authority would be needed to continue VCP through FY2018. On August 12, 2017, President Trump signed into law the VA Choice and Quality Employment Act of 2017 ( P.L. 115-46 ), which authorized and appropriated $2.1 billion for the Veterans Choice Fund (\u00a7802 (a) P.L.113-146; 38 U.S.C.\u00a71701 note). These funds would remain available until expended. ", "In addition, Section 801(a) of the Choice Act (P.L.113-146; 38 U.S.C.\u00a71701 note), provided an additional mandatory funding of $5 billion to increase veterans' access to health care by hiring more physicians and staff and to improve VA's physical infrastructure.
