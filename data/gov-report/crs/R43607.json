For FY2015, the President has requested $415 million, approximately 25% more than the historic obligation rate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Annual or Advance Funding", "paragraphs": ["The 113 th Congress and the Administration have chosen to use the annual appropriations process to fund Project BioShield. This contrasts with the previous method of providing a single appropriation for the duration of the appropriations authority. This change affects both the private countermeasure developers and the federal countermeasure planners.", "Developers contend that a multiyear advance-funded account devoted to Project BioShield acquisitions remains integral to their ability to develop countermeasures. Some developers contend that an advance appropriation helps company management more favorably consider a potential countermeasure when weighing internal investment opportunity costs. Additionally, some developers assert that an advance appropriation makes it easier to obtain capital from external investors. ", "The switch to annual appropriations may complicate HHS's long-term countermeasure development and acquisition planning. However, other agencies, such as the Department of Defense and NASA, successfully use the annual appropriations process for complex, multiyear acquisitions. The federal countermeasure development process will likely continue to produce uneven acquisition opportunities and activity. In some years, one or multiple countermeasures may reach a point in development that HHS deems appropriate for a Project BioShield contract. In those years, HHS might obligate hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire countermeasures. However, in years in which no countermeasures reach that point in development, HHS might not obligate any money for Project BioShield contracts. This issue may be partially addressed by Congress allowing the funds to remain available until expended or until the appropriation authority expires. Congress did so for the FY2014 appropriation and the President has requested this for FY2015 as well. ", "Alternatively, Congress could use the advance appropriations mechanism to provide funding for multiple years as it did for FY2004-FY2013. This may address the developers' desire for a multiyear appropriation and may help HHS's ability to plan acquisition programs. Developers might prefer advance appropriations for as long a period as possible. However, providing an advance appropriation during the current fiscal environment may prove more difficult than in 2003. Additionally, increasing the duration of the advance appropriation may make it more likely that future Congresses transfer money out of the account for other purposes. Advance appropriating funds for more than one year but less than the four remaining years might balance these competing pressures. ", "Prior Project BioShield performance might influence congressional policy makers as well. Those who assess the program's production with an advance appropriation favorably might be more likely to support a return to an advance appropriation. Those assessing its performance negatively might be more likely to support an annual appropriation process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Use of Project BioShield Appropriations for Other Purposes", "paragraphs": ["Congress has used funds appropriated for Project BioShield acquisitions for other purposes (see Figure 1 ). Congress transferred approximately one-third of the Project BioShield advance appropriation to fund BARDA activities. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 (PAHPRA, P.L. 113-5 ) allows the HHS Secretary to transfer up to $1.4 billion of FY2014 through FY2018 Project BioShield appropriations to BARDA for countermeasure advanced development. Thus, the HHS Secretary could transfer the entire $255 million FY2014 Project BioShield appropriation to BARDA for advanced development. The Secretary must notify Congress of such transfers and annually report the amount of funding remaining available for Project BioShield procurements. Congressional oversight of such transfers could help ensure that HHS uses Project BioShield appropriations in a manner consistent with congressional intent. Congress could restrict or expand such transfers through future appropriation law provisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Countermeasure Replacement Costs", "paragraphs": ["All biomedical countermeasures have a finite shelf-life after which their safety and efficacy may decrease. Thus, the government will need to replace the countermeasures in the SNS in order to maintain the same degree of preparedness. If the federal government increases the number of countermeasures, then such costs would likely increase. The HHS has used funding from the SNS annual appropriations and the Project BioShield advance appropriations to purchase replacements for expiring countermeasures. The National Biodefense Science Board (NBSB) projected that countermeasure replacement costs will pose an increasing strain on SNS funding. Several strategies may mitigate countermeasure replacement costs, including better development and acquisition planning, contracting with vendors to manage and store countermeasures, developing countermeasures with longer shelf lives, extending the shelf life of currently stored countermeasures, and developing broad spectrum countermeasures. ", "The federal government might mitigate some replacement costs through better planning. According to the NBSB and a 2010 internal HHS review, PHEMCE had insufficiently considered lifecycle costs during countermeasure acquisition planning. Subsequently, HHS has begun a five-year countermeasure budget plan process that includes consideration of replacement costs. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act ( P.L. 113-5 ) codified this planning requirement, explicitly requiring consideration of replenishment costs in the five-year countermeasure budget plan. ", "For countermeasures with viable commercial markets, such as antibiotics, the government can reduce replacement costs by contracting with the vendor to store the countermeasure. The vendor rotates its normal commercial stock through this storage. Thus, rather than the government acquiring specific vials of countermeasure that will expire, the government has acquired the right to immediately access a specific amount of countermeasure that the vendor is constantly refreshing. According to BARDA, this vendor-managed-inventory approach \"ensures [countermeasures] will not expire due to stockpiling and significantly reduces the overall life-cycle management cost for these products.\" The Project BioShield contracts for the anti-radiation countermeasures Leukine and Neupogen use this vendor-managed-inventory model. ", "Countermeasures requiring less frequent replacement could reduce cost. The PHEMCE is actively pursuing countermeasures that have a longer shelf-life than current versions. For example, BARDA is supporting the advanced development of a more stable smallpox vaccine. ", "The FDA Shelf Life Extension Program can extend the useful life for stored countermeasures beyond their original expiration date. Through this program, the FDA tests the stability and quality of drugs stored in the SNS and other federal partners. The FDA may approve a new expiration date for those drug lots meeting the appropriate criteria. This program is only available for countermeasures regulated as drugs, not those regulated as biologics. Many of the most expensive countermeasures acquired through Project BioShield, including vaccines and the anthrax and botulinum antitoxins, are biologics and not eligible for this FDA program.", "Reducing the number of products in the SNS may lower replacement costs. Such a reduction may occur by HHS shifting towards acquiring countermeasures that address multiple material threats. Additionally, countermeasures designed against multiple threats may be more likely to have a commercial market. For example, BARDA is supporting the advanced development of a new antibiotic to treat plague and tularemia that may have a commercial market for treating certain pneumonias and urinary tract infections.

Of the $3.3 billion of Project BioShield appropriations used to acquire countermeasures, HHS devoted approximately 90% to just three threats: anthrax, smallpox, and botulinum. See Figure 2 . Project BioShield did not acquire any countermeasures against the other eight material threats. ", "Medical countermeasure procurement planning is complex. The disparity between material threats and acquired countermeasures might be attributable to any of the following factors. A DHS material threat determination is required for Project BioShield countermeasure procurement, but it does not address how appropriate it is that HHS pursue a countermeasure through Project BioShield. Planners must consider many other factors in pursuing a balanced countermeasure portfolio, including whether existing commercially available countermeasures might address the threat; the likely impact of a successful attack; how effectively a countermeasure could be deployed and used during an emergency; how much time and money the countermeasure would need before it could be added to the stockpile; and the cost and benefit gained from a countermeasure compared to other potential countermeasures. ", "Despite the complicated decision processes associated with countermeasure development and acquisition planning, active congressional oversight may help ensure the most effective use of Project BioShield funds. Such oversight may be helped through more detailed HHS reporting requirements mandated in the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 ( P.L. 113-5 )."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
