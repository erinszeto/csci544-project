The National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) also has proposed a market stabilization component as part of its comprehensive package of suggested reforms to dairy policy. Supporters of price stabilization and supply management say that inherent incentives to overproduce need to be offset by a program to manage supplies in a measured way. Critics of supply management, including dairy processors, contend that such measures could reduce the competitiveness of the U.S. dairy industry, limit its incentive to innovate, and raise consumer prices, because, they argue, a pricing system based on supply control and/or cost of production potentially rewards inefficiency.", "The market-based approach, including a separate element of the NMPF package, represents an opposing view on how the federal government should address the problem of farm milk price volatility and periodic financial stress for dairy farmers. This approach contends that, because it is difficult to manage milk supplies and prices administratively, the best approach is to provide a government program that helps farmers manage risk associated with volatile prices of milk and feed. Specifically, a new \"safety net\" would be established to protect a dairy farmer's \"margin\"\u2014that is, the farm price of milk minus feed costs\u2014regardless of current price levels. Critics expect that incentives to overproduce will aggravate the financial woes of the dairy industry indefinitely, and thus argue that controlling potential price variability and combating depressed farm prices with supply management is necessary for the long-term financial health of producers.", "The third area of potential policy change is to alter the current pricing approach used in federal milk marketing orders (FMMOs) to directly increase dairy farm revenue. For example, one potential change to base milk pricing in FMMOs on the cost of milk production (i.e., S. 1645, introduced in the 111th Congress) would imply higher prices received by dairy farmers. However, some are concerned that the long-run competitiveness and stability of the U.S. dairy industry could be at risk because of the unknown effectiveness of provisions to discourage overproduction.", "On March 3, 2011, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Dairy Industry Advisory Committee approved its final report to the Secretary, who established the committee to make recommendations on how USDA can best address dairy farm profitability and milk price volatility. Many of the group's 23 recommendations fall into the market-based approach, including a recommendation for margin insurance on quantities of milk that exceed the cap for the Milk Income Loss Contract Program (MILC) and a tax-deferred savings accounts for dairy farmers.

After appeals from dairy farmers for more financial assistance, Congress granted another $350 million in October 2009 in the form of supplemental payments to dairy farmers and government purchases of dairy products for domestic feeding programs. ", "Under financial pressure, many dairy farmers sent milk cows to slaughter and some went out of business. The subsequent decline in milk production and a simultaneous rebound in foreign demand have lifted the farm price for milk. Still, financial concerns remain for dairy farmers who lost significant amounts of farm equity during the milk price collapse. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the number of dairy farms in the United States declined from 67,000 to 65,000 during 2009. The total fell to 62,500 as of December 31, 2010.", "The financial stress of 2009 and similar episodes over the years have led the industry and Congress to reconsider how to handle fluctuations in milk prices and financial prospects for dairy farmers.

Larger operations tend to have lower per-unit costs, and as firms reduce their costs, they become more competitive and can increase sales and market share. Firm size is a limiting factor for growth, however, once the gains to economies of scale have been exhausted.", "For the dairy industry, the number of farms continues on a downward trajectory, though at a much slower pace during the last decade than in the late 1960s and 1970s. Annual losses averaged 96,000 operations in the late 1960s and 37,000 in the 1970s. In recent years, the annual drop in dairy farm operations has slowed to about 2,000 to 5,000 farms per year, with operations totaling 62,500 on December 31, 2010.", "Increases in productivity have more than offset declines in the numbers of dairy farms and cows, resulting in a steady upward trend in total milk production ( Figure 2 ). Meanwhile, domestic demand for milk, on a per-capita basis, has grown slowly, at 0.4 % per year since 1990. Rising consumption of dairy products such as cheese has offset a decline in fluid milk consumption. Exports of dairy products have increased in recent years, reaching record levels in 2008.", "The trend in farm numbers depends on farm size. Between 2005 and 2009, farms with fewer than 500 cows registered declines, while farms with 500 to 999 cows held steady ( Table 1 ). In contrast, the number of farms with 1,000 or more cows increased 20%, driven by significantly lower costs of production. In 2005, dairy farms with 1,000 cows or more had average costs of production of $13.59 per cwt, 15% below the average for farms with 400-999 head and 35% below the cost for farms with 100-199 head. Average costs were much higher for even smaller operations.", "The structure of dairy farms also varies by region of the country ( Table 2 ). The average farm size in western states (e.g., California, with 850 cows per farm) is well above the U.S. average of 133 cows per farm. In contrast, Wisconsin has many small farms and an average farm size of 88 cows. ", "Cost structure varies by state ( Figure 3 ). In the western states, where large dairy farms dominate the industry, operating costs have been affected by high feed costs in recent years because these farms purchase much of their feed (alfalfa and grain prices reached record levels in 2008). However, per-unit overhead costs tend to be relatively low for these operations because fixed costs (e.g., buildings/equipment) can be spread over a large number of animals. In other parts of the country, such as Wisconsin, where producers feed more grain and hay that is produced on the farm, operating costs tend to be lower when grain and feed prices rise. However, these farms tend to have fewer dairy cows, so per-unit overhead costs are relatively high."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Brief History of Dairy Marketing and Policy", "paragraphs": ["In the mid-1850s, most milk was consumed on farms by the family or fed to livestock; some was sold for very local use. As urban areas grew, milk was sent to processors to supply these areas with both fluid and manufactured products. By the turn of the century, producers banded together into cooperative associations to bargain with milk handlers (fluid milk processors) as a way to offset handler market power stemming from a large number of producers facing a small number of processors. In the early 1900s, dairy farmers increasingly looked toward cooperatives as a means of marketing their milk, specifically by negotiating with milk buyers using collective bargaining. By 1925, handlers were paying farmers for milk according to its use (fluid or manufactured products). This concept is known as \"classified pricing\" and is still in use today. Milk for fluid use has the highest value, reflecting higher transportation and handling costs. ", "When the Great Depression hit, demand dropped sharply and the voluntary classified pricing system broke down. Federal milk marketing orders were established (and continue to function today) to stabilize the market and help equalize the market power of dairy farmers with dairy processors (see \" Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMOs) ,\" below). Another motivation for establishing FMMOs was to ensure that consumers had adequate and dependable supplies of milk at reasonable prices. During this same period, legislators enacted import quotas on dairy products to protect producers from foreign competition. Eventually, during World War II, demand increased for farm commodities, including milk. In the late 1940s, the government began supporting the price of milk (and other commodities) to protect against price declines through a price support program for milk, now called the Dairy Product Price Support Program (DPPSP)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Dairy Policy", "paragraphs": ["Current federal dairy policy has essentially five components: (1) dairy product price support (through the DPPSP), (2) federal milk marketing orders (FMMOs), (3) direct payments under the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) Program, (4) the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP), and (5) tariff-rate quotas on dairy imports.

In contrast, when product prices are above support levels, the DPPSP is not a factor in the market and farm milk prices reflect prevailing supply and demand conditions. Year-to-year changes in farm milk prices have increased since the mid-1990s because price support levels have been reduced below typical market-average prices through legislation.

Under FMMOs, the farm price of approximately two-thirds of the nation's fluid milk is regulated in 10 geographic marketing areas. Some states, California being the largest, have their own milk marketing regulations instead of federal rules.

As such, FMMO minimum prices rise and fall each month with overall changes in the wholesale dairy product market. Under marketing orders, the price farmers receive for their milk is calculated based on these minimum prices and on how milk is utilized (fluid vs. manufacturing) in the marketing order, which collectively is called \"classified pricing.\" The classified pricing system requires handlers to pay a higher price for milk used for fluid consumption (Class I products) than for milk used in manufactured dairy products such as yogurt, ice cream, and sour cream (Class II), cheese (Class III), and butter and dry milk products (Class IV).

Under specific assumptions, the research results indicate the program would have raised dairy farm margins significantly during the March-December 2009 period. More of the production adjustment, at least during the early stages of program implementation, would have occurred in states where production had increased from year-earlier levels (e.g., Texas, New Mexico, Michigan, Wisconsin) rather than in states where production was mostly unchanged or had declined from year-earlier levels (e.g., California, Washington, Pennsylvania). ", "Separately, a report supported by the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA), a group representing dairy manufacturers, estimated the amount of money that would have been withheld from producer checks if DMSP had been in place between 2000 and 2009. The report states that proportionally more withholdings would have come from states in the Midwest and East, implying that the proposed program would have a proportionately smaller impact on producers in the Western and Southwestern regions. Critics of the analysis, including the National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF), contend that withholdings under DMSP would be proportional to regional production and therefore regionally \"fair.\" Moreover, NMPF says the analysis ignores the expected positive impact on overall producer margins stemming from the expected decline in production and increase in consumption that together would drive up milk prices.

The program's structure and operation is similar to the DMSP, but several aspects of the program are different:", "The base would be fixed at a predetermined level while the program is in operation. Supporters are concerned that, with a continuously updated base as provided under the DMSP, some operations, particularly large ones, might be encouraged to produce more milk in order to build base and profit from the expected higher prices once other producers reduce their output. The trigger for MMP would activate the program more quickly as margins decline; the national margin trigger is $7 per cwt, with farm revenue paid on 99% of base. DMSP parameters are $6 and 98%. For milk produced above base amounts, farmers would receive the average (blend) price minus the Class III price (nationally determined), or approximately 10% of the expected value (compared with 0% under the DMSP). This provision is designed to make the \"penalty\" for overproduction the same for all farmers nationwide (i.e., the Class III price) rather than a variable penalty depending on regional milk prices. For example, under DMSP, the implied penalty for farmers in the northeastern or southeastern United States\u2014where production costs and milk prices are higher than in other parts of the country\u2014would be greater than the Class III price.

The concern for overproduction could be and has been applied to commodities such as corn and wheat. But dairy generally is more susceptible to overproduction, some dairy producers and market observers say, because current policy encourages producers to maximize production and they tend to add cows even when prices are low to improve cash flow. Advocates also expect market volatility to continue and possibly increase as the United States becomes a larger player in the international markets. Supporters say a system to moderate some of the market shocks in the years ahead would benefit the dairy industry and reduce the number of farms that go out of business when profitability drops sharply. ", "Analysis by university researchers indicates that the supply management proposals described above would reduce milk price volatility and generally reduce government expenditures on dairy programs. According to the research results, the MMP Program (Agri-Mark) and the DMSP (National Milk Producers Federation) also would marginally enhance average milk prices, primarily because the programs would increase demand by purchasing dairy products for domestic assistance programs. As analyzed, the program established under the Costa and Sanders bills introduced in the 111 th Congress would result in slightly lower average prices, but researchers say this hinges on the level of program parameters. ", "While volatility is reduced upon implementation of any of the programs, the study results indicate that substantial volatility would remain in the market, implying that producers will still need to manage price risk for the indefinite future. In addition, large shocks from changes in either demand or supply have the potential to overwhelm any of the proposed programs, according to industry experts. ", "Critics of supply management, including dairy processors, contend that supply control could reduce the competitiveness of the U.S. dairy industry, limit its incentive to innovate, raise consumer prices, and decrease demand for dairy products because, they argue, a pricing system based on supply control and/or cost of production potentially rewards inefficiency. Critics also argue that administratively matching supply and demand can be difficult because these factors can change quickly.", "In general, as members of an industry competing in a global market, U.S. dairy farms would have less incentive to reduce their cost of production because their individual shares of national production would be protected when profitability declines below certain levels. In this case, production would be reduced on all farms to avoid economic penalties. Currently, the production adjustment is generally made by farmers who can no longer continue operating because their costs are too high or they no longer have farm equity or bank credit to continue operating. In a related issue for dairy processors, prospective constraints on the growth of milk production by region would have impacts on processors interested in expanding or locating new processing plants. Moreover, critics of supply management say it will change how processors invest in manufacturing plants and new markets and products because, they say, processors will not know when program triggers will reduce milk production and drive up prices.", "Economists note several unintended consequences of supply management, including the incorporation of program benefits (i.e., higher and less volatile milk prices) into farm asset values such as prices that farmers or investors would be willing to pay for land, cows, dairy facilities, and the associated farm milk base. This development would likely drive up costs of producing milk.
