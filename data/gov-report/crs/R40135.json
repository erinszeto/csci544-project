By the end of September 2009, GAO found that $830 million of the $1.3 billion in M\u00e9rida funds appropriated for Mexico and Central America as of that time had been obligated by the State Department, but only $26 million of the funds had actually been spent.

Congress is playing a role in the design of post-M\u00e9rida security cooperation with Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean Basin during its consideration of the Obama Administration's FY2011 budget request. For FY2011, the Administration has asked for $310 million in assistance for M\u00e9rida programs in Mexico, $100 million for CARSI, and $79 million for CBSI. Detailed strategy documents for CARSI and CBSI are not yet available, but Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced a new strategy for U.S.-Mexican security cooperation after a high-level meeting in Mexico City on March 23, 2010.

According to the Department of State's 2010 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report , as much as 90% of all cocaine entering the United States flows through Mexico or its territorial waters, with at least 42% of that cocaine first stopping in Central America. A small number of Mexican drug trafficking organizations (DTOs), often mistakenly referred to as \"drug cartels,\" control the most significant drug distribution operations along the Southwest border. Mexican DTOs have expanded their dominance of the U.S. drug market by increasing their transportation and distribution networks, as well as displacing other Latin American DTOs, primarily Colombians. ", "Since taking office in December 2006, Mexican President Felipe Calder\u00f3n has made combating the DTOs a centerpiece of his domestic policy agenda. The Calder\u00f3n government has scored some significant victories against the DTOs, such as the killing of Arturo Beltr\u00e1n Leyva and capture of Teodoro Garcia Simental. However, the government's crackdown, as well as turf wars among rival DTOs, has fueled an escalation in violence throughout the country, including states along the U.S.-Mexico border. In 2008, more than 5,100 people in Mexico were killed in drug trafficking-related violence, a 126% increase over 2007. In 2009, conservative estimates indicate that more than 6,500 people, including 35 soldiers and close to 500 police officers, died as a result of drug trafficking-related violence homicides, with the violence largely concentrated in five states. In many areas of those states, such as Ciudad Juarez in Chihuahua, violence has remained at elevated levels despite the presence of large numbers of federal troops and police. Thus far in 2010, drug trafficking-related violence has escalated even further, with record levels of violence occurring in new \"hot spots\" in Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, and Sonora. ", "Mexican DTOs are also expanding their operations into Central America , a volatile region where the governments of some countries\u2014particularly Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras\u2014are already dealing with some of the highest violent crime rates in the world. Central American law enforcement officials have even less training and equipment to deal with DTOs, organized crime, and criminal gangs than their Mexican counterparts, making them highly susceptible to drug-related corruption. In addition, as with Mexico, Central American countries continue to have problems with impunity and human rights abuses by security forces that have hindered the performance and reputation of their law enforcement and judicial systems.

In FY2007, for example, Mexico received $36.7 million in counterdrug assistance and the only Central American countries to receive counterdrug funds were Guatemala ($1.9 million) and Panama ($3.3 million). ", "In response to the Mexican government's request for increased cooperation and assistance, in October 2007 the United States and Mexico proposed the M\u00e9rida Initiative, a package of U.S. counterdrug and anticrime assistance to Mexico and Central America. As proposed, the M\u00e9rida Initiative was to provide some $1.4 billion in assistance, largely in the form of equipment and training, from FY2008 through FY2010. The four primary goals of the M\u00e9rida Initiative, as originally conceived, were to (1) break the power and impunity of criminal organizations; (2) assist the Mexican and Central American governments in strengthening border, air, and maritime controls; (3) improve the capacity of justice systems in the region; and (4) curtail gang activity in Mexico and Central America and diminish drug demand in the region. Within these over-arching goals, the State Department developed specific objectives and performance measures for evaluating the M\u00e9rida Initiative. These indicators are likely to expand, however, given the new, broader focus for M\u00e9rida programming efforts. ", "According to its proponents, the M\u00e9rida Initiative is more than just a foreign assistance package, it is a new kind of regional security partnership between the United States, Mexico, and Central America. Analysts and U.S. officials have repeatedly said that for the initiative to be successful, all the countries involved will have to accept their \"shared responsibility\" to tackle domestic problems contributing to drug trafficking and crime in the region, including U.S. drug demand. Since President Calder\u00f3n took office, Mexico has increased security spending (to $6.9 billion in 2010), mobilized thousands of soldiers and police to drug trafficking \"hot-spots\" throughout the country, and enacted judicial and law enforcement reforms. The Obama Administration has, for its part, launched a Southwest Border Initiative that has resulted in record seizures of arms and bulk cash flowing into Mexico, carried out multi-agency law enforcement operations against Mexican DTOs, and increased intelligence-sharing with Mexican counterpart agencies. Central American leaders have regularly met to develop ways to better coordinate their security and counterdrug efforts through the Central American Integration System (SICA)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Funding the M\u00e9rida Initiative: FY2008-FY2010", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Mexico", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FY2008 Supplemental Appropriations", "paragraphs": ["In June 2008, the 110 th Congress appropriated $352 million in FY2008 supplemental assistance and $48 million in FY2009 bridge fund supplemental assistance for Mexico in P.L. 110-252 , the FY2008 Supplemental Appropriations Act (see Table 1 for funding for Mexico by year and aid account).

As the DTOs increasingly evolve into poly-criminal organizations, perhaps as a result of drug interdiction efforts cutting into their profits, some analysts have also urged both governments to focus more on combating other types of organized crime, such as human trafficking and alien smuggling. ", "Many security experts also maintain that the Mexican government, with U.S. support, needs to focus more on addressing the country's weak law enforcement and judicial institutions than it has in the last three years (pillar two). Federal police reform is well underway, but serious questions remain as to when and how the federal police will take over the anti-drug functions currently being carried out by the Mexican military. It also remains to be seen how federal reform efforts (and U.S. efforts to support them) will be expanded to include state and municipal police forces. Some FY2009 M\u00e9rida funding is likely to be reprogrammed in order to extend U.S.-funded police training and corrections reform efforts to Chihuahua and Juarez as part of a pilot project. Designed by a binational team, the project has been designed to support the Mexican government's plan for Juarez through training, equipment, professional exchanges, and targeted information-sharing. Security experts have also identified improving police-community relations, respect for human rights, and the prevention and punishment of street crime as important issues that need to be addressed in Juarez and elsewhere in Mexico. ", "With impunity rates hovering around 98%, experts maintain that it is crucial for Mexico to implement the judicial reforms passed in the summer of 2008 and focus on fighting corruption at all levels of government. In order for Mexico to transition to an accusatorial system with oral trials by 2016, some argue that U.S.-funded judicial training programs, some of which are just getting started, may have to be significantly expanded. They are encouraged that $207 million of the Obama Administration's FY2011 request for M\u00e9rida-related programs in Mexico are under the \"Governing Justly and Democratically\" aid category.

It may involve the establishment of a \"model port\" and the expansion of trusted travel and shipper programs. It may even involve moving some customs and security checkpoints away from the border, possibly to sites in Monterrey or Guadalajara, and then using smart seals to ensure that checked goods arrive from those sites to the United States without tampering. Pillar three also seeks to help Mexico deploy new technology to better patrol its southern border with Guatemala and Belize. ", "Pillar four will be a new focus for U.S.-Mexican cooperation, and may include targeted efforts to assist at-risk youth and curb unemployment and other social problems in communities plagued by drug trafficking and violence. Experts have lauded the inclusion of social development and crime prevention programs in the new M\u00e9rida framework, but expressed concern about the limited funds the programs are likely to receive from the United States. It appears that the funding and implementation of pillar four will primarily be the responsibility of the Mexican government, possibly with support from multilateral institutions like the Inter-American Development Bank. ", "Bilateral efforts under pillar four are focusing on pilot projects in Ciudad Juarez and Chihuahua, but may also be expanded to Tijuana and the state of Baja California. These efforts involve the continuation and expansion of some existing M\u00e9rida-funded initiatives, such as school-based \"culture of lawfulness\" programs and demand reduction and treatment services. They may also involve USAID or other agencies providing technical expertise in how to re-zone neighborhoods to prevent crime, issue municipal bonds to fund infrastructure projects, and/or launch public-private partnerships. It is also still possible that the Mexican government may request additional U.S. support to carry out President Calder\u00f3n's \"We Are All Juarez\" plan, which includes 160 different initiatives that the federal government, in collaboration with state and local officials, will implement in the city.

According to H.Rept. 111-187 , addressing drugs and crime in Central America requires a longer term commitment than the three-year M\u00e9rida program. Some analysts specializing in Central American security issues hope that by splitting Central America away from U.S.-Mexican security cooperation programs, the sub-region will receive more focus, funding, and attention from Congress and the Administration. Others disagree, asserting that it is important to have an integrated approach to counterdrug and anti-crime programs in Mexico and Central America, as the M\u00e9rida Initiative was initially designed to do. The Obama Administration requested $100 million for CARSI in its FY2011 budget request: $70 million in Western Hemisphere Regional INCLE funds and $30 million in Western Hemisphere Regional ESF funds. ", "Some policy issues that have emerged during congressional consideration of the Central American portion of the M\u00e9rida Initiative include", "Funding: When the M\u00e9rida Initiative was announced, Central American leaders and some Members of Congress expressed concerns about the funding disparity between the Mexican and Central American portions of the initiative. Lingering questions remain about the adequacy of the funds provided, as well as how much of those funds should be spent on regional programs versus bilateral programs in the seven Central American countries. Type of Funds Provided: In the FY2008 Supplemental Appropriations Act, Congress reduced the funds appropriated for law enforcement programs in Central America in order to increase funding for institution-building, rule of law, and development programs. The FY2008 supplemental and FY2009 omnibus appropriations measures included earmarks for those types of programs, but the FY2010 appropriations bill did not. Members have and will likely continue to debate how funding should be balanced between the various program components in CARSI, particularly how much funding should support law enforcement programs and drug interdiction efforts versus institution-building and rule of law activities. Pace of Implementation: As previously stated, the December 2009 GAO report on the status of M\u00e9rida funding has raised serious concerns among Members of Congress about the slow pace of implementation. While the pace of implementation in Mexico has quickened, many projects in Central America continue to be stalled. Inst ability in Particular Countries: As a result of the June 2009 ouster of President Zelaya, some M\u00e9rida assistance for Honduras was put on hold until February 2010. The issue of how to deal with instability in particular countries is likely to arise again during M\u00e9rida and CARSI implementation. Interagency Coordination: Debates are likely to continue concerning what U.S. agency is best equipped to carry out M\u00e9rida and CARSI programs, including the issue of whether there is a role for DOD acting through U.S. Southern Command, and how U.S. programs should be coordinated with those funded by other donors. Anti-gang Policies: There is ongoing disagreement over the level and combination of preventive and suppressive policies that should be used in Central America to address the gang problem. Proponents of law enforcement solutions maintain that Central American law enforcement officials lack the capacity and resources to target gang leaders effectively, share data, and conduct thorough investigations that lead to successful prosecutions. Human rights groups tend to emphasize the importance of prevention and rehabilitation programs. U.S. Deportation Procedures: Congress may also maintain an interest in how U.S. deportation procedures for individuals with criminal records might be improved and whether U.S. assistance should be provided to help receiving governments reintegrate deportees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI)", "paragraphs": ["The Obama Administration did not include Haiti and the Dominican Republic in its FY2010 request for M\u00e9rida.
