The specific crops are barley, canola, corn, flaxseed, oats, rye, sorghum, soybeans, sunflower seed, triticale, wheat, and mixed grain. As issued and modified in regulations, official grain standards define each grain, classes of the grain, and numerical grades. The grades specify physical characteristics such as minimum weight and maximum percentage of defects (e.g., foreign material, damaged kernels). The standards facilitate the marketing of grain by serving as contract language, enabling buyers and sellers to more easily determine quality (and therefore value) of these commodities.

Specifically, to encourage the marketing of high-quality grain for an agriculture sector that is highly dependent upon export demand, the USGSA requires that exported grains and oilseeds be officially inspected (if sold by grade) and weighed. Export inspections are carried out by either federal inspectors or federally supervised state inspection agencies, called delegated official inspection agencies.

Each agency covers a specific and exclusive geographic area, which is authorized by the USGSA in part to ensure that the official state or private agency receives enough business for it to remain financially viable and to maintain staff for an on-site laboratory that can serve the entire area.

Other provisions extended the lead time to initiate changes in standards from 90 days to one year and increased penalties for violations of the act. ", "Another significant change in the mid-1970s elevated the federal role following investigations into reports of misgrading of grain, \"short\" weighing, bribery, and other irregularities in grain inspection and weighing. A number of firms and individuals were indicted by federal grand juries and ultimately convicted. The incidents threatened the credibility of the U.S. grain marketing system, and in response, amendments to USGSA were enacted in 1976 that for the first time established official weighing services, recordkeeping by elevators, registration of grain exporters, and user fees to cover federal supervision costs. Importantly, the 1976 amendment established the Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) and required either federal inspection or state agency inspections for export.

A step further is advocated by the National Grain and Feed Association and the North American Grain Export Association, which want tonnage fees based on a flexible calculation that would result in more accurate fees and prevent an excessive buildup in the trust fund. The Advisory Committee also recommended that the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration publish financial information for FGIS user fee accounts on a monthly basis to the agency website for access by users.

In general, Congress appropriates money for programs after a specific act has authorized the appropriation. However, appropriators could still choose to fund FGIS if this provision lapses, either as a separate FGIS appropriation or by providing clear legislative intent that the GIPSA appropriation would cover FGIS activities not funded by fees. There is no constitutional or general statutory requirement that an appropriation must be preceded by a specific act that authorized the appropriation. Nevertheless, renewed authority would eliminate potential uncertainty about whether Congress would choose to appropriate funds without an authorization. ", "An example of \"unauthorized\" appropriations occurred in 2012 during the lapse of the 2008 farm bill ( P.L. 110-246 ). More than 100 farm bill programs briefly lost their authorization for appropriations at the end of FY2012, before a one-year extension was passed on January 1, 2013. These programs nonetheless received appropriations of $2.3 billion in FY2012.

User fees that are separate from those collected for direct services support FGIS's supervisory activities. The following provisions would have expired on September 30, 2015, and affected fees for the required federal supervision of official agencies for export services. Fee collection for domestic services also would have been affected.", "Authority to charge fees for the required federal supervision of export inspections performed by a state agency and the authority to invest these funds would have expired (USGSA, as amended, Section 7(j)(4); 7 U.S.C. 79(j)(4)). This would have ended the use of state agencies for export inspections unless alternative funding for federal supervision were secured. ", "Similarly, authority to collect fees for the required federal supervision of weighing services performed by an official agency would have expired (USGSA, as amended, Section 7A(1)(3); 7 U.S.C. 79a(l)(3)). This would have ended the use of official agencies for weighing services unless alternative funding for federal supervision were secured. ", "Additionally, for services performed directly by FGIS (both export inspections and weighing) after September 30, 2015, fees would have had to exclude administrative costs, in the absence of reauthorization. ", "Based on CRS interpretation of the statute, the expiring provisions of USGSA would not have necessarily shut down export inspection and weighing services because of two possible scenarios: (1) FGIS could have performed all inspections and weighing (financed completely by user fees and without administrative costs included in the fees), or (2) another source of funding for federal supervision of state agencies could have been secured to replace revenue from discontinued fees. ", "In other words, the expiring provisions would not have affected authority for FGIS to perform direct inspection of exports and weighing services and to collect user fees for these services. Currently, FGIS accounts for about two-thirds of export inspections, while state agencies account for the remainder (under federal supervision). Thus, FGIS could have expanded its share to 100% by providing all export inspections. Such a shift might have disrupted operations of the current inspection system. FGIS would have needed to hire more staff to handle the substantial increase in workload of direct inspection and weighing activities. Users would have still paid for the services because the law allows FGIS to charge user fees to cover the inspection and weighing costs (but not administrative and supervisory costs). Presumably any additional costs would need to be covered by appropriated funds. ", "As an alternative to shifting all export inspections and weighing to FGIS, the agency could have maintained the current mix of both direct federal inspection and federal supervision of other official agencies' export inspections and weighing services, but only if alternative funding had been secured for federal supervision, such as additional appropriations or transfers from other accounts.", "Expiration of these provisions would likely have disrupted the current grain inspection and weighing program, and could have imposed significant adjustments to FGIS operations to cope with loss of authority to collect user fees for supervising export services. No estimates are available for how user fees or appropriated levels might change if FGIS performs all inspections and weighing services. Also, given current budget austerity, additional appropriations might have been unlikely.", "Limits on Administrative and Supervisory Costs", "Current law establishes a 30% limit on administrative and supervisory costs relative to total costs for services. The cap had been put in place (and subsequently reduced) to encourage cost cutting by FGIS (USGSA, as amended, Section 7D; 7 U.S.C. 79d). If the cap on collecting fees for supervisory costs (described above) had expired, the result might have been higher total costs for inspections and weighing (requiring higher user fees) because FGIS would not have been required by statute to contain administrative and supervisory costs.", "Authority for Advisory Committee", "Authority for an advisory committee would have expired (USGSA, as amended, Section 21(e); 7 U.S.C. 87j(e)). The advisory committee meets regularly to advise FGIS on programs and services it delivers, and its recommendations are designed to help the agency better meet the needs of its customers. The committee is composed of 15 members appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture. They represent various segments of the grain industry, including grain producers, processors, merchandisers, handlers, exporters, consumers, grain inspection agencies, and scientists.
