The current Senate Budget Resolution (S.Con.Res. 8) includes a similar provision for the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and JCT. These estimates are not part of the official revenue estimate, but could affect views on legislative proposals.", "Official revenue estimates include many behavioral changes, but hold GDP constant. Dynamic scoring allows for changes in GDP. Models for estimating effects on GDP that are used by government agencies and academics are complicated. To those interested in dynamic feedback effects on GDP, these models may appear to be \"black boxes.\" This report, although necessarily technical itself, examines the models used for dynamic scoring, what effects they are reflecting, and how consistent their responses are with empirical evidence. The following points summarize the major findings of the report.", "Revenue neutral income tax reform that lowers statutory income tax rates through broadening the base, although assumed by some to spur growth, can potentially contract the economy. The base broadening, by making more income subject to tax, increases effective rates and offsets statutory rate reductions. Models must take these effects into account to appropriately estimate effects of tax reform.", "When taxes increase or decrease, some effects that have been estimated may be less appropriate than others to include in the analysis. Some models estimate demand side stimulus effects, which are transitory and can only matter when there is unemployment in the economy. These may not be appropriate to consider in evaluating permanent tax policies. Questions may also be raised about including effects of deficits or surpluses in reducing or increasing investment due to changes in government borrowing. In both cases, these effects apply to spending as well as to tax changes.", "Sometimes claims are made that the feedback effects from reducing taxes will largely offset the revenue loss through \"supply side\" effects that increase GDP and the tax base. No reasonable estimate of the responses of labor supply or savings to tax changes can produce such offsets. The feedback effect from a simple and flexible growth model is less than 10%, given empirical evidence of supply responses, which are small and of uncertain direction.", "More complex models for studying supply side effects (intertemporal models), that are based on a more rigid theoretical structure, produce similar results for changes in taxes on wages if the assumptions of the models are consistent with the empirical evidence on labor supply. A review of models currently or recently used by government agencies and academics suggest that is not generally the case (an exception is the JCT's model).", "Effects of tax cuts on capital income can be large in these more complex models, reflecting shifting of consumption and leisure to periods far in the future. These shifts, which can induce large short-run increases in labor supply and saving, are generally not supported empirically and may be unlikely. One question is whether the benefits of formal theory in these models outweigh their empirical weaknesses."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Dynamic scoring (or dynamic revenue estimating) for tax legislation has been an issue of interest for at least the past 25 years.

The current Senate Budget Resolution ( S.Con.Res. 8 ) includes a similar provision requiring the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), with the assistance of the JCT, to prepare a supplemental estimate incorporating the feedback effects into a cost estimate for legislation with provisions affecting revenues that have a revenue impact of $5\u00a0billion or more in any fiscal year. These analyses are not part of the official score, but rather provide projected feedback effects, although some may argue that feedback effects should be included in revenue estimates.

Dynamic scoring as used in this report refers to incorporating those macroeconomic effects. It is often discussed in connection with revenue legislation because tax revisions may cause \"supply side\" effects (changes in labor supply and savings) due to changes in effective average and marginal tax rates."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "How Dynamic Scoring Differs from Current Scoring Methods for Tax Legislation", "paragraphs": ["Current revenue estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation include a variety of micro-economic behavioral responses that affect revenue yields. For example, increasing capital gains taxes is assumed to cause a reduction in realizations that reduces the potential revenue gain. A variety of other behavioral responses are considered in preparing estimates. These estimates, however, keep total output (i.e., GDP) fixed. Effects on output have been provided in some cases, but are not included in formal scorekeeping. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Determines the Economic Effects from Dynamic Scoring", "paragraphs": ["The effects of dynamic scoring on revenues depend on numerous factors: the types of effects included, the types of models used, and the magnitude of behavioral responses (elasticities) incorporated in the model. Three types of effects have been considered in previous studies by the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office: (1) the short run stimulus effect where a tax cut increases demand and output in an underemployed economy, while a tax increase reduces output; (2) the effect of deficits or surpluses on crowding out or crowding in investment due to government borrowing; and (3) the supply side effects (increases or decreases in labor supply, domestic savings, and net investment from abroad in response to changes in effective tax rates). ", "There are reasons to consider only the supply side effects since the other two effects also occur with spending changes. There are especially strong reasons to exclude stimulus effects, since permanent changes in the tax code should not depend on fiscal timing. That is, a permanent tax code change should not be evaluated more or less favorably because it is enacted during a recession. Moreover, the short run stimulus effects may be offset by the Federal Reserve System. ", "Supply side effects from tax cuts are often presumed to increase output. However, they can either increase or decrease output because of offsetting income and substitution effects. A tax cut, by increasing income, causes an increase in consumption, including consumption of leisure, which reduces labor supply. This effect is the income effect. A tax cut that affects marginal earnings will cause leisure to be more costly relative to consumption which will increase labor supply. This effect is the substitution effect. Income and substitution effects also occur for savings. A reduction in the tax rate on the return to savings, and the higher return, means that one can consume more now and more in the future, reducing savings. This effect is the income effect. At the same time, the lower tax rate (and higher yield) makes the price of future consumption lower and increases savings, the substitution effect. These effects are typically measured as an elasticity: the percentage change in quantity divided by the percentage change in price or income. For example, if the labor supply elasticity with respect to the wage rate is 0.2, a 10% increase in wages will cause a 2% (0.2 times 10%) increase in labor supply. ", "The projected effects of a tax change on output and revenues depend on the design of the tax change, the type of model, and the magnitude of income and substitution elasticities. Two very different types of models for estimating supply side response are a simple growth model with labor and savings supply responsive to wages and rates of return, and an intertemporal model with a complex theoretical structure in which individuals allocate leisure and consumption over time. The behavioral responses rely on many aspects of these intertemporal models which are not always transparent.", "During the budget horizon, labor supply is likely to be the dominant factor, in part, because additional capital tends to accumulate slowly. Output increases when the labor supply or the capital stock increases, with labor supply the larger input. A tax change affects the capital stock by affecting savings or investment, which is typically only 2% to 3% of the capital stock. Even if the saving rate increased by 50% in the first year, the capital stock would only increase by about 1%. Outside the budget window, capital accumulation may become more important and, for some reforms, can dominate the effects on labor. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Special Issues with Revenue Neutral Tax Reform", "paragraphs": ["With a revenue neutral tax reform, where rate cuts are financed by base broadening, the focus is generally on supply side effects, since the effects on short term demand or the deficit and crowding out should be negligible. Moreover, in a revenue neutral change there are no income effects in the aggregate to reduce supply as would be in case in a rate cut alone. If the change is also distributionally neutral any effects arising from these factors are even less likely. Thus the focus of dynamic effects is on substitution effects. ", "In a tax reform, it is crucial to recognize that the behavioral response cannot be measured solely by statutory rate changes. The effective marginal tax rate determines this behavioral response and changes in the income base that change the share of income taxed at the margin also affect this marginal effective tax rate. It is possible for base broadening provisions to raise effective marginal tax rates more than enough to offset the effects of a cut in statutory tax rates, leading to a contraction rather than an expansion in output.", "This potential for base broadening to affect marginal effective rates means that it is not possible to project the effects of a base broadening tax reform that specifies the rates but does not specify how the revenue is to be offset by base broadening. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expected Supply Side Effects of Dynamic Models", "paragraphs": ["When there is a revenue loss or gain or when marginal effective tax rates change there can be supply side responses. The following points can be made: ", "In simple transparent supply side models that directly incorporate labor supply and savings responses as indicated by empirical evidence, feedback effects on revenues are expected to be small, in the neighborhood of 3% to 8%. That is, a revenue loss will be reduced by 3% to 8%, and a revenue gain will be increased by 3% to 8% in an overall tax cut. Effects might be slightly larger in open economies. More complex intertemporal models can yield similar results with respect to wage tax cuts, if similar elasticities are embedded in the models. In these models, spending must match taxes in the long run, so the results depend on how deficits or surpluses are addressed. An examination of models currently or recently used indicates that many of these models have implicit behavioral responses for labor supply that are much larger than those that are contained in simpler growth models, or that can be supported with empirical evidence. The JCT's intertemporal model, however, has elasticities similar to those found in empirical studies. Responses in intertemporal models to changes in taxes on capital income can be large. These models have a rigid structure that causes responses in savings that reflect reducing consumption today for more consumption many years in the future to a degree that is unlikely and not empirically studied. In addition, they cause an increase in labor supply to shift leisure from the present to many years in the future that is also not likely or supported by empirical evidence. One question is whether the more desirable theoretical structure of these models balances the lack of empirical justification. ", "The remainder of this report provides a more detailed analysis. "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Types of Effects and Types of Models", "paragraphs": ["Dynamic scoring normally employs models of the aggregate economy. In some of these models there is a single rate of return and a single type of saving and supply of capital; changes in taxes which affect the rate of return directly or indirectly can lead to additional savings. ", "These models typically do not address certain features of the corporate tax. Although corporate tax revenues are relatively small compared to individual tax revenues, corporate changes could have significant effects on the overall rate of return. Aggregate economy models capture these effects on savings rates. Corporate taxes, however, may also have more immediate and larger effects on capital, because they may affect flows of capital to and from the rest of the world. This process could occur more quickly than the effects (if any) on increased domestic saving. Most aggregate models have relatively primitive (if any) adjustment for this effect, although corporate models that focus separately on international capital flows exist."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Aggregate Models of the Economy", "paragraphs": ["There are three types of revenue feedback effects:", "short-run stimulus, or Keynesian (demand side) effects; crowding out effects of deficits on investment (and crowding in effects of surpluses); and supply side effects.", "Stimulus effects, such as those in a tax cut, can increase output temporarily in an underemployed economy by increasing income and spending. This increase in demand leads to the return of some unemployed individuals and resources to production. Crowding out occurs because the increase in federal borrowing due to increased deficits displaces capital that would otherwise be used for private investment. The magnitude of the effect depends on how much government borrowing is from foreign sources. ", "The third type of effect, which is often of the most interest, is commonly called a supply side effect because it refers to the effects of tax or other policies on the amount of labor supplied or the amount of savings or investment (which would affect the size of the capital stock). This effect is more closely associated with tax changes, although it could apply to some spending programs as well. (For example, spending on infrastructure such as bridges or highways would affect productivity, and means-tested transfer payments can affect work incentives.)", "These different effects may not be precisely separated (for instance, deficits increase interest rates which can cause a change in savings that is a supply side effect; and tax cuts could simultaneously cause demand side and supply side effects). The three effects can be isolated by sensitivity analysis that includes policies to control for stimulus and deficits effects (as the JCT often does). ", "There are three basic types of economic models (plus combinations) that vary in whether and how they reflect the three types of effects.", "Short-run models with underemployed resources typically used for short-run forecasting and to estimate short-run stimulus effects on aggregate demand, but not effects of deficits or supply side effects. These models are also referred to as IS-LM models. They can only be solved by assuming some particular monetary policy of the Federal Reserve System. They are often used in the private sector for forecasting and tend to have multiple sectors. Basic neoclassical growth models (also called Solow models) with direct estimates of labor and savings supply responses. This type of model, in its pure form, assumes full employment and does not capture short run stimulus, but can capture crowding out effects and supply side effects. Its effects are driven by the labor supply elasticities (percentage change in labor divided by the percentage change in wages) and savings elasticities (percentage change in savings rates with a percentage change in after-tax rate of return). Intertemporal growth models, where individuals allocate leisure and consumption within periods and across time. These actions give rise to changes in labor supply and savings responses. These models capture only supply side responses, as full employment is assumed and deficits are offset by some other policy change. The models are of two forms. One form is the Ramsey, or infinite horizon, model where people are represented by an infinitely lived agent. The other form is the overlapping generation (OLG) life-cycle model where agents have finite lives (typically around 55 years to cover the working period and retirement), and a new generation is born each year, while an old one dies (hence the term overlapping generations). Agents in intertemporal models often have perfect foresight (i.e., know all of the wage rates and rates of return in the future) although they can be constructed to allow risk and uncertainty, and OLG models can be myopic. Intertemporal models cannot indefinitely have deficits or surpluses, and in the Ramsey model even temporary deficits have no effects. Because these models have a relatively rigid structure, they include a labor supply response to changes in the rate of return. For some tax changes this response to the rate of return may be the major source of a short term labor response. Hybrid models, which combine short term stimulus effects with growth models. For example an IS-LM model can be combined with a Solow model. Hybrid models that allow unemployment through sticky wages (i.e., wages do not immediately adjust to changes in demand) can combine with a Ramsey infinite horizon model. In the latter case, some agents in the economy are presumed to be liquidity constrained (cannot borrow). ", "The alternative models can produce different results both due to the model choice and to the elasticities, or assumed responsiveness, embedded in the model. In addition, some models can (but may not) allow capital flows to and from the rest of the world. In general these models do not include an explicit modeling of open economy effects but may include open economy effects on supply in a variety of ways. For example, an open economy with perfectly mobile capital can be introduced by fixing the interest rate as is done in one variation of the CBO's open economy model. The infinite horizon model, however, is incompatible with perfectly mobile international capital. Rule-of-thumb offsets against crowding out are used in some of the Solow growth models to assign part of borrowing to foreign sources. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Corporate Models", "paragraphs": ["Corporate models of a closed economy have long existed but they have not generally been used to measure feedback effects. These models, in fact, often simplified the requirements of aggregate modeling because the standard analysis concluded that the corporate tax fell on capital in general, given a fixed capital stock. For purposes of a dynamic model, the corporate tax could then be treated as no different from a general tax on the rate of return. In addition, even though changes in the corporate tax rate could shift capital between the corporate and non-corporate sectors, the corporate tax base would be unlikely to change, because, although the capital stock in the corporate sector decreases with a higher corporate rate, the rate of return rises and these two effects tend to be offsetting.", "Open economy considerations suggest that the corporate tax should be considered differently from other types of taxes on capital income. The tax on corporate equity, which is effectively or at least partly a source based tax, unlike individual income taxes on interest and dividends, can directly affect capital flows into and out of the country, thereby increasing output through another route (rather than indirectly affecting the rate of return to savings). Indeed, given the evidence that saving is relatively unresponsive to rates of return and tends to accumulate slowly, capital flows from abroad could potentially be one of the more important dynamic issues to consider.

This modeling exercise, along with others done over the years, is posted on their website. In their first analysis in 2003, they used three types of models to analyze macroeconomic effects: macroeconomic short-term effects based on commercial models, a Solow growth/hybrid model, and an OLG life-cycle model.

Some base broadening provisions (such as slowing depreciation deductions) have a larger revenue gain in the short run than in the long run. In addition, flattening the individual income tax rate structure leads to lower revenues in the long run by reducing real bracket creep (the rise in the average effective tax rate in a progressive tax system as real incomes rise).

Thus, it is the substitution effect that is the driver of supply side responses to a revenue neutral tax cut.

Most of the major provisions that could be used for base broadening in a revenue neutral corporate tax reform directly offset effects on investment incentives of lowering rates. One of the largest, accelerated depreciation, if traded for a statutory rate reduction, would increase the effective tax rate on new investment and discourage investment. This effect arises because the rate cut has a windfall benefit for old capital while accelerated depreciation does not.", "Assuming corporate tax reform is neutral in the long run, estimates suggest that eliminating all tax expenditures other than deferral (which affects foreign source income) could reduce statutory corporate tax rates by about 5 percentage points, from 35% to 30%.

", "Some base broadening provisions would, when used to reduce the corporate rate, likely offset the rate reduction, with no effect on investment. An important example is the production activities deduction, the second largest tax expenditure, excluding deferral, which would allow a reduction of a percentage point in the statutory tax rate. This provision allows a rate reduction of 3.15 percentage points on profits from domestic production in some industries. If it is eliminated, to finance a rate reduction, effective rates will rise for profits eligible for the deduction and fall for others with likely no overall effect. Although it would not affect savings, it might reduce net equity capital inflows because the industries eligible for the deduction are more likely to be multinational corporations, contracting the capital stock. ", "Eliminating deferral or other provisions that increase the taxation of foreign source income, which would allow approximately a three percentage point rate reduction, in contrast with accelerated depreciation, would likely reinforce any supply side effects of rate reduction with respect to international capital inflows, increasing investment.

This channel of growth is questionable, because intellectual capital is not located physically. Once it exists it can be used everywhere. For example, when a firm discovers Lipitor, it uses the formula no matter where the pills are made. When a firm develops the technology for a smart phone, or a search algorithm, that knowledge can be applied costlessly to production everywhere. It does not matter if the patent is held in country A and licensed to country B, or vice versa. Therefore, shifting ownership of intellectual property to the United States cannot increase productivity in the United States because that input is already in existence. Shifts in intellectual property may alter revenues, but not output. The case is similarly weak for marketing intangibles.

Thus, an analysis of revenue neutral tax reform that relied only on cuts in marginal statutory rates would find larger supply side effects than a rate cut that was not revenue neutral. Labor supply would unambiguously increase from cuts in marginal rates on labor income. In intertemporal models, labor supply also responds to the rate of return. The substitution effect means that, with a higher rate of return, future consumption, including future leisure, becomes cheaper so agents work more in the present to save and have more leisure in the future. This behavior would have a direct increase on output in the short run through increases in labor input and also would cause a larger savings response and increase in the capital stock. ", "This approach would overstate supply side effects because individual income tax reforms that broaden the base could also have effects on the marginal effective tax rates. Depending on the provision, a revenue neutral change could increase or decrease labor supply and savings since these behaviors are affected by the change in the share of the income at the margin subject to tax.", "The most straightforward example of how base broadening provisions could affect marginal effective tax rates is the itemized deduction for state and local income taxes. According to IRS statistics in 2010, the average deduction on itemized returns for state and local income taxes was 5.5% of income for those with an AGI of $200,000 or greater. Because most state income tax rates are progressive, income taxes paid as a share of income would be even higher at the margin. Using an example of 6%, if the federal statutory income tax rate is 35%, and the state income tax is deductible, the total tax rate that applies to the last dollar of income is 35% plus 6% minus the value of the tax deduction (0.35 times 6%), or 38.9%. If the state and local income tax deduction is eliminated or capped, the effective marginal tax rate rises to 41% (35% plus 6%). On average then, disallowing the state income tax deduction is the equivalent of raising the marginal tax rate by 2.1 percentage points for taxpayers claiming itemized deductions.", "Although state and local income taxes make this point clearly, any source or use of income that is tax favored and applies at the margin would have the same effect on supply response. The scope of this marginal effect is also significantly broadened when considering that part of the labor supply response to changes in wages is a participation response, which makes the margin for this purpose the average tax on the wage income of that participant. For example, the earned income credit has been estimated to increase the participation of lower-income unmarried women; a reduction in that credit, even though it does not apply to last dollar, would have a participation effect. The tax benefit of excluding employer health insurance, for example, may not have an effect of marginal wage but could affect a participation response. ", "A recent CRS report estimated that, for taxpayers at the top marginal income tax rate, a revenue neutral elimination of itemized deductions would leave effective marginal rates largely unchanged. The effect was largely due to the elimination of the itemized deduction for state and local taxes and charitable deductions which tend to rise continually with income.

", "The short run stimulus effect affects aggregate demand through increased spending due to tax cuts. This increased spending increases output by re-employing unemployed resources (workers who have lost their jobs and idle capital). As some workers become employed and increase their own spending and profits rise, the additional income introduces new spending, which in turn leads to additional production. The successive rounds of output effects are called multipliers. These effects only occur in an underemployed economy (otherwise the stimulus increases the price level) and they are transitory because eventually the economy would have returned to full employment without the stimulus.", "There are a number of reasons that this effect might be inappropriate to consider in dynamic estimation. The most basic argument is that changes in the tax code shouldn't depend on the fiscal timing, as tax changes can be hard to reverse. A permanent tax cut should, it may be argued, not be viewed more favorably because it was enacted in a recession. ", "A second reason for not including these effects, is that they also occur with spending changes. Moreover, spending multipliers are typically more powerful than tax cut multipliers because a part of tax cuts is not spent. If the purpose of the change is to stimulate the economy, then that decision would be better informed by comparing tax cuts with spending increases, rather than considering the effects of tax cuts alone. In a sense, dynamic estimates are already accounted for when multipliers for different spending and tax cuts are estimated. ", "Third, the magnitude and even existence of a stimulus effect depends on assumptions about the behavior of the country's central bank, the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve can take measures to offset a fiscal stimulus with a monetary contraction or a fiscal contraction with a monetary expansion to keep output constant. They can also fully accommodate the change by keeping interest rates constant and strengthening the stimulus or contraction, or they can do anything in between. If, however, the Federal Reserve has a fixed objective for output, fiscal policy would simply be one more factor to counteract in their policies and a tax cut or tax increase would not affect output. When the JCT does dynamic estimates, it generally includes a case where the Federal Reserve offsets the policy, which is helpful in interpreting the contribution of these transitory effects.

That is, it began as a model that could explain observations, much as the Keynesian IS-LM models were developed to explain the Great Depression. The Solow growth model was easily adapted to examining tax changes by making the labor supply a function of after tax wages and the savings rate a function of the after tax rate of return.", "A simple version of this model, presented in the Appendix , can be used to illustrate the magnitude of expected feedback effects. Although the model abstracts from specific features of the tax system, it roughly represents current taxes with a 25% income tax. The results suggest that a 20% reduction in marginal tax rates on labor taxes would increase output in the short run by around 0.5% to 1% and revenue feedback effects would be around 3% to 7% (assuming the capital stock is fixed, a fairly reasonable short run assumption). This estimate uses a labor supply elasticity of 0.1 and 0.2, similar to the elasticities used by JCT and CBO (as discussed subsequently). These feedback effects are relatively minor. ", "The feedback effects for capital income are somewhat more complex, because it takes a period of time to achieve them. For example, if the capital stock is growing at 3% due to savings, even a 100% increase in investment (either from savings or from capital inflows) would increase the capital stock by only 3%. For growth in the capital stock arising from savings, one simulation showed that by the fifth year (the midpoint of the budget horizon) only 9.6% of the final adjustment in the capital stock had occurred. ", "To illustrate the possible feedback effects, Table 1 uses a 0.1 and 0.2 labor supply elasticity along various savings rate elasticities to derive the long run steady state. The first two savings elasticities are 0.0 and 0.4. A zero savings elasticity is a central tendency from the literature that used aggregate time series data to estimate the elasticity; 0.4 is towards the larger positive estimates in that literature. An infinite elasticity is provided to show maximum potential long run effects (that is, savings must eventually rise or fall to return to the initial after-tax return). ", "These longer run effects are not very different from the short run effects when the savings supply elasticity is zero. For example, the feedback from a labor income tax cut is 4% to 9% rather than 3% to 7%. Larger savings elasticities can eventually lead to more significant feedback effects, although none is large enough to fully offset the revenue loss. ", "For budget horizon estimates, it is important to note that a Solow growth model takes a long time to reach the steady state. Effects from labor tax changes in the budget horizon are already close to the long-run steady state. When capital income tax cuts were involved, the effects in the budget horizon tend to be small relative to the long-run steady state (when an effect occurs). In a study of capital income tax cuts with a 0.4 elasticity, on average in the first five years (the mid-point of the budget horizon) only about 10% of the adjustment was complete, and by year 25 only about a third. Strictly speaking, an infinite elasticity would imply immediate adjustment, but such a large change in the savings rate is not plausible, and this is one reason some economists found this type of model to account for savings responses unsatisfactory.

In the latter case, the maximum effect assuming perfectly mobile capital would be the same as the capital stock elasticity at infinity for a small country with perfect product substitution and a source based tax. However, that extreme case is unlikely to occur, since estimates suggest the investment substitution elasticity is closer to 3. Moreover, the United States is a large country, products are imperfect substitutes, and taxes are a combination of source based and residence based. All of these factors would reduce the effects. One study of a ten percentage point decrease in the corporate tax rate (a partial cut in capital income taxes) suggested an output increase of less than 0.2% for an elasticity of 3.

A simple savings elasticity cannot be derived from underlying utility functions. Intertemporal models were developed to conform to fundamental economic theory about consumer choice by incorporating a utility function to generate labor and savings supply responses. In these models, consumers choose consumption and leisure over time. Some issues arise about intertemporal models of either type, and some are peculiar to either the Ramsey infinite horizon, or life-cycle OLG models.", "Some of the initial intertemporal models held labor constant and attempted to study saving in that way. However, modelers also wanted to incorporate labor supply. These models produce results that may be theoretically elegant but are difficult or impossible to support with empirical research, particularly when labor supply can be shifted intertemporally. Moreover, the theoretical requirements of these models require some very strong assumptions about individuals' information. In a typical intertemporal model of either type, individuals have perfect foresight and perfect information (they know how wages and rates of return will change over time for the economy as a whole for an infinite time period of time or a very long time). Intertemporal models, however, can be constructed to include uncertainty, as is the case with the CBO OLG model, which assumes wage shocks and uncertain lifetimes. In this type of model, individuals have precautionary savings which is less responsive to changes in the rate of return. ", "It is difficult, if not impossible, to incorporate the various institutional rigidities in the labor and savings markets. Individuals in these models can generally enter and leave the work force without penalty, for example, even though in reality leaving the work force may make re-entry at the same wage more difficult. They can change hours even though for many jobs a fixed work week, such as a 40 hour week, is the norm. They can borrow and lend without constraints and at the same rate (although some models have introduced borrowing constraints for some agents who cannot borrow). ", "Also, intertemporal models cannot permit a permanent deficit that leads to unlimited growth in the debt-to-GDP ratio; a way to deal with the deficit must be incorporated in the modeling exercise. Thus an intertemporal model cannot be used to examine a tax cut or tax increase; it must be a tax cut or increase and something else, such as a spending change or a future change in taxes, or a lump sum payment, each producing a different result.", "Intertemporal models also presume a certain type of behavior with respect to savings behavior that may not characterize actual behavior. Agents in these models look ahead and base their current savings on all of the future periods in their life (even up to infinity). But many individuals either cannot or will not behave that way. For example, some individuals are young and have no assets or cannot borrow, and if they would like to consume more than their income at this stage of their life, they cannot, so they save nothing and only change consumption when income goes up. Some individuals do not have enough information or knowledge to operate by some type of \"rule-of-thumb,\" such as saving a fixed dollar amount or a fixed share of income. Others may be at a stage where they want to build a rainy day fund for precautionary purposes, or may be saving for a target (such as enough to make a down payment on a house). Some of these alternative models of savings are discussed by Elmendorf. As noted above, the CBO OLG model includes risk and precautionary savings, along with age related borrowing constraints. ", "There are also issues specific to each type of model. Since individuals do not live an infinite period of time, the infinite horizon, or Ramsey, model version of the intertemporal model appears on its face to be unrealistic. It can only be justified as a depiction of actual individuals' choices rather than as the prescriptive planning model it was originally developed as, if individuals are assumed to take into account the welfare of their descendants (who in turn consider the welfare of their descendants, who in turn consider their descendants, and so forth). In general, there is no marriage in these models which could have implications for bequests; agents grow through an asexual reproduction process; in addition, there is no allowance for those without children. The long run elasticity of savings is infinite, so that the after tax return always returns to its original value. It is for this reason that the model is inconsistent with an open economy.", "The OLG life-cycle model seems more realistic, although lack of marriage and the presence of childless agents in the models currently used still have potential implications for the savings response (since these may affect bequests). The OLG model, at least in some forms, allows those who are retired to return to the labor force again, without accounting for the unlikelihood of returning to the work force after many years of retirement. This feature appeared in the original Auerbach-Kotlikoff model. Some models, however, have a fixed retirement age, including those of John Diamond. The importance of this feature varies with the type of tax revision, and can be very important in a reform that replaces income taxes with consumption taxes because the loss in purchasing power of income from retired individuals causes them to return to the labor market to restore income through an income effect. ", "Some of these aspects can be altered. Researchers have had some success in incorporating uncertainty into models, which can account for some rainy day saving which responds differently from saving for retirement or bequests. The Congressional Budget Office OLG model is of this type, although the magnitude of the effect is not clear. ", "With consistent parameters that produce the same income and substitution elasticities for labor supply, the effect of a permanent tax cut on wages is similar in Solow and intertemporal models. However, the effect of a change in the tax on capital income is different because it will elicit a labor supply response to a change in the tax rate on savings.

This small response appears to reflect both income and substitution elasticities that are small, so that even if a tax change substantially lowers marginal relative to average rates (the first affecting substitution and the second affecting income), the response would be small. This evidence includes historical observation, cross section econometric studies, and estimates from experiments. Much of the interest and challenge is estimating responses related to the behavior of married women, where a large fraction of this group does not participate in the labor market. Studies of married women have produced larger, although varying responses. In recent decades, however, as the participation of married women in the labor market has increased, their responses have declined and have become more like those of men.

The studies indicated substitution elasticity with a mean of 0.31 and a median of 0.13. The income elasticity had a mean of -0.15 and a median of -0.12. A working paper by researchers at the Congressional Budget Office reviewed recent research and indicated a substitution elasticity for men from 0.1 to 0.3, with an income elasticity of 0.0 to -0.1. Married women had substitution elasticities from 0.2 to 0.4, with the same income elasticity range. For the work force as a whole a substitution elasticity of 0.1 to 0.3 was indicated. ", "One point should be noted about labor supply responses: if labor supply is very responsive in either direction, then it is difficult to explain why labor market participation rates and hours for men have been so constant over a long period of time when both real pre-tax wages and tax rates have been changing. Moreover, it is even more difficult to expect a large positive response when historically the rise in real wages in the latter part of the 19 th century and early part of the 20 th century has been associated with a reduction in the work week. (Women have increased their participation, largely during the 1970s and 1980s, but this change may reflect technological advances in household production, declining fertility, and changes in cultural attitudes.) The CBO OLG model assumes a zero labor supply elasticities (income and substitution effects offset each other) which is compatible with a model where wage rates grow indefinitely. Models that do not have a zero labor supply response have to assume some time dependent change in tastes for leisure versus consumption to be compatible.", "Note that while labor supply elasticities are entered directly into Solow type models, they have to be derived from intertemporal models, given the standard form of the utility function (the mathematical expression that yields the tradeoff between consumption and leisure) and depend on the time endowment.

The intertemporal elasticity of substitution (IES) measures the percentage change in the ratio of consumption in two periods divided by their relative prices. For comparing two adjacent periods, the price in the second period relative to the first is (1/(1+r)) (which is the discount factor for money in the second period, where r is the after tax rate of return). Thus, the percentage change in price is the change in r divided by (1+r). The IES is the primary driver of savings responses that arise from shifting consumption to the future, and contributes to the labor supply effect due to intertemporal shifting of leisure.", "Empirical studies have looked at changes in macroeconomic consumption aggregates in some cases and have used individual consumption behavior in others to estimate the elasticity. The pioneering study of intertemporal substitution elasticities was by Robert Hall, who found that the elasticity was extremely small, could be zero, was statistically insignificant and was no more than 0.2. Early surveys of the value led to the use of elasticities of 0.25 to 0.33. Most subsequent studies produced elasticities below 0.5, although some very large ones were estimated. ", "Recently a large meta-analysis (an analysis that combines data from many studies) of estimates of the IES across many countries found an overall elasticity of 0.5 for the world on average and 0.6 for the United States was prepared. About half the 169 studies were based on U.S. data. The authors cautioned that the estimates were aimed at comparing across countries and were too large in value because of publication bias. Publication bias is a problem widely recognized in many fields. Basically if theory indicates an elasticity should be positive, and the estimate is negative, peer reviewers are less likely to recommend publication, editors are less likely to publish, and researchers, expecting the unlikelihood of publishing, tend not to submit their articles (which often involve a fee), or even prepare a working paper. Yet, when a large number of estimates have been made, because of the fundamental theory of statistical estimation, some would be negative (particularly if the true value is low). Publication bias also suggests that estimates of the income and substitution elasticities are probably too large in absolute value.", "One of the co-authors of this meta-analysis subsequently published the basic (worldwide) results after correcting for estimated publication bias. The correction indicates that the elasticity for macro aggregate studies is zero (as Hall originally found). In the basic case (without selecting across studies for other characteristics) the elasticity for micro studies (which were about a quarter of the studies) was 0.22. He also reported that the elasticity for micro studies of asset holders was 0.36. His preferred estimate with various other characteristics selected was 0.33 for asset holders. In general, an IES for asset holders would be only appropriate if the model identified a separate group of liquidity constrained consumers. For a model without that feature the elasticity for asset holders would be too high. If the macro elasticities were considered as well as micro, then an IES of zero to 0.2 might be in order.", "Note also that other types of estimates discussed in this section, including the estimates of standard labor substitution elasticities already reviewed and the intertemporal labor supply elasticities discussed subsequently, may also be affected by publication bias, since they included only estimates in the direction expected by theory. ", "There are two caveats about the empirical evidence on the IES for consumption. The first is that the estimates have considered periods that are close together, but the elasticity in models is applied over many periods of time and is determined by a utility function that assumes a constant elasticity of substitution. Most of the effect on savings from a change in the tax rate on capital income arises from reducing current consumption to shift it to these periods further into the future. Yet, basic economic theory suggests elasticities are higher for closer substitutes, and close together periods would be expected to be closer substitutes than further apart periods. Thus the IES estimate should be an upper bound. ", "The second, and perhaps more important, concern for effects in the budget horizon, is that due to the nature of the utility function, leisure also responds to changes in the rate of return, which then generates a significant short run labor supply response. No empirical evidence supports this response, which can dominate the effects when taxes on capital income are cut deeply. Ballard, a discussant of the intertemporal model simulations carried out by the JCT stated \"Any simulation model that generates a large elasticity of labor supply with respect to the interest rate is shooting in the dark.\" Ballard believes that the controlling of the response of labor supply to interest rates is crucial to modeling and that this can be achieved, in part, via the time endowment (limiting the available supply of leisure).

As is the case with standard labor supply estimates, it is calculated from other parameters in intertemporal models. ", "There are two types of estimates. Some are from micro data studies that examine individual behavior over time. These elasticities tend to be small, on the whole, at least for men. There are also estimates from aggregate micro data, which tend to be large, usually above 1 or 2. These macroeconomic estimates are largely based on variations in hours and wages over the business cycle. They rest on the assumption that unemployment during recessions is voluntary, while most models of business cycles consider workers who lose their jobs or have their hours reduced are largely involuntarily unemployed or underemployed. Assuming some or most of unemployment is involuntary, these estimates overstate the Frisch elasticity. ", "The micro data studies largely concentrate on the response of hours of work and examine the response with profiles of wages and hours over time. Both show an inverted U shape, with fewer hours when young and when old, and lower wages when young and old, respectively, but the shapes are quite different, which leads to lower elasticities.", "Turning to the microeconomic data, Keane also surveyed the Frisch elasticity studies for men for hours of work. He lists 13 studies with a mean elasticity of 0.85. The estimate, however, was greatly influenced by one outlier (of 6.25); with that study excluded, the mean was 0.4. The median value was 0.31 although six of the studies had values clustered between 0.03 and 0.17, while the others varied substantially. CBO researchers recently examined the Frisch estimates. They relied on microeconomic evidence. As discussed in their paper, the few studies of Frisch elasticities for married women tend to be higher than those of men. The elasticity estimates for women also appear to be declining, consistent with other work that shows married women's labor supply response is becoming more like that of men. The paper also reviews labor force participation elasticities, where studies have been focused on those close to retirement. Overall, the authors suggest a range of the Frisch elasticity from 0.27 to 0.53, with a central estimate of 0.4. Neither of these studies reference Ball, who found a zero Frisch elasticity.

However, workers may have an embedded lunch hour, and spend some necessary time commuting (which is like working, in that it provides benefits such as lower housing prices), household activities, and care of family members. The American Time Use Survey indicates that the ratio of leisure to the sum of leisure and work is 43% for men aged 35 to 44 and 47% for women in the same age range.

According to current data average hours are 42.5 for those who usually work full time and 38.5 for all workers. Neither study had a discussion of the basis for their choice.

The other intertemporal elasticity of labor supply (the change in labor as the relative price of future consumption changes through changes in the rate of return) is the ratio of leisure to labor, multiplied by the intertemporal substitution elasticity.

As indicated in Table 4 , in contrast to the Solow models the implied labor substitution elasticities are higher than those empirically estimated in the CBO, the Treasury Ramsey model and the Diamond tax reform. A large part of the reason for this high elasticity is the large leisure share of time, although they also tend to have larger substitution elasticities. All of the income elasticities are too large in absolute value and all of the models except CBO have a backward bending labor supply (in contrast to the Solow models). The largest absolute values are in the Treasury Ramsey and Diamond Tax Reform model, with the lowest in the JCT and Diamond Zodrow Housing study. Since the form of the utility function forces the income elasticity of demand for leisure to be one, these values are driven by the leisure share of time. Compared to empirical estimates, the Frisch elasticity is too high in the Treasury Ramsey model, and in a general range in the rest of the models. Finally, the last elasticity, the intertemporal labor supply response to the interest rate should probably be close to zero since there is no evidence supporting any response. They are largest in the Treasury models and the Diamond tax reform study. ", "Is it possible to make choices that would lead to better elasticities? It would require using the time endowment as a tool to fit the model to evidence, as suggested by Ballard. For example, set the intertemporal elasticity at 0.2, consistent with the evidence. Set the intratemporal substitution elasticity at 1.5 and the leisure share of hours at 0.15. Then the labor substitution elasticity would be 0.225, the income elasticity would be -0.15, and there would be a slight positive elasticity of total labor supply. The Frisch elasticity would be 0.23 (using labor and leisure shares as proxies for shares of consumption and leisure), at the low end, but reasonable considering publication bias, and the elasticity of labor with response to price change would be 0.026, small enough not to be very troubling.", "Note that the CBO model is a model with uncertainty. Generally, uncertainty should lead to precautionary savings that is not sensitive to the interest rate, and a lower savings response.

However, intertemporal models are far less transparent, and modelers appear in some cases to make little attempt to connect the elasticities associated with labor supply to the ones found in empirical evidence. The JCT model used in the past has come close but, as illustrated, it is possible to come even closer to matching the empirical evidence, while at the same time minimizing \"shooting in the dark\" with a labor supply response to the interest rate. JCT also incorporates life-cycle elements in their MEG model that do not involve labor supply responses to rates of return. Nevertheless, the assumption of equal substitution elasticities between consumption across far apart periods means that these models still rest on unproven, and probably unreasonable assumptions about the elasticity of substitution between consumption amounts that are ten or twenty years apart. There is a question of whether intertemporal models do more harm than good, at least with respect to the feedback effects during the budget horizon, especially when parameter choices may induce a large labor supply response to the rate of return. ", "Intertemporal modelers presenting the background on their models sometimes report the first two values in Table 4 but no measure of the leisure share of time, which makes it impossible to evaluate on the basis of their published work. Sometimes even the minimal information on elasticities is not provided. (JCT and CBO report all their relevant assumptions.) Without the parameters to understand the models (and particularly without information on the time endowment), these models become impossible to evaluate or compare."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.

", "A decrease in labor supply looking only at the labor market would be expected to raise wages which would affect the wage base and also have a feedback effect on labor. The rise in wages and the contraction in labor would also increase the rate of return to capital. This in turn could cause an increase in the capital stock (either from savings or from capital flows from abroad). To address these effects in the short run, the model would also require a production function which shows how labor and capital can be combined. ", "Every model has a \"numeraire\" or a fixed value since economic effects depend on relative, rather than absolute, values. A sensible numeraire for this model is the overall price level, P. Changes in prices are a weighted average of the wage and rate of return depending on their share of income.

If taxed at the same rate, the result is [Eat]/[(1-t)(1+aE)], which is 0.8% to 1.6%. Adding both responses = [Et]/[(1-t)(1+aE)]. As this example indicates, with an across the board tax the feedback effects are not much different incorporating these general equilibrium effects (3.2% and 6.4% rather than 3.3% and 6.6%). ", "These results can also be used to show increases in output. In the case where the capital stock is fixed, the percentage change in labor for a given percentage change in the after tax share is the same as the feedback effect in (3) but since labor is only a part of output, it would be multiplied by the output share (0.75). The result is the same as the ratio in (7). Thus a 20% decrease in the tax rate would increase output, with an elasticity of 0.1, by 2.4% times 0.2, or 0.5% percent. For the 0.2 elasticity the result would be 1%.", "The previous short run model had a fixed capital stock and three variables, the rate of return R, the wage rate W and the labor supply, L. A Solow growth model allows (if it is a closed economy) growth over time in capital and feedback effects. In the long run, that permits a change in capital. Capital can grow not only because of a change in savings rate but also because increased labor income generates capital to go along with it even if the savings rate does not change.
