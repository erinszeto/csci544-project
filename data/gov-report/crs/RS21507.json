In 2003, President Bush proposed Project BioShield to address this need. The Project BioShield Act became law in July 2004 (P.L. 108-276).", "This law has three main provisions: (1) relaxing regulatory requirements for some CBRN terrorism-related spending, including hiring and awarding research grants; (2) guaranteeing a federal government market for new CBRN medical countermeasures; and (3) permitting emergency use of unapproved countermeasures. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has used each of these authorities. The HHS used expedited review authorities to approve grants relating to developing treatments for radiation exposure and used the authority to guarantee a government market to obligate approximately $2 billion to acquire countermeasures against anthrax, botulism, radiation, and smallpox. The HHS has also employed the emergency use authority several times, including allowing young children with H1N1 \"swine\" influenza to receive specific antiviral drugs.", "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Appropriations Act, 2004 (P.L. 108-90) advance-appropriated $5.593 billion for FY2004 to FY2013 for Project BioShield. Subsequent Congresses have removed approximately 8% of the advance appropriation through rescissions and transfers to other accounts. In FY2004 and FY2005, Congress removed a total of approximately $25 million through rescissions. In the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 111-8), Congress transferred $412 million to other programs supporting countermeasure advanced research and development and pandemic influenza preparedness and response. For FY2010, President Obama has proposed transferring an additional $305 million to support countermeasure advanced research and development and transferring the account from DHS to HHS. The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010 (H.R. 3293) would make both these requested transfers. This legislation would also make a transfer that was not in the President's request: $500 million out of the Project BioShield account to support basic research in HHS.", "Since passing the Project BioShield Act, subsequent Congresses have considered additional measures to further encourage countermeasure development. The 109th Congress passed the Pandemic and All-Hazard Preparedness Act (P.L. 109-417) which created the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) in HHS. Amongst other duties, this office oversees all of HHS' Project BioShield activities. The Pandemic and All-Hazard Preparedness Act also modified the Project BioShield procurement process. Questions remain regarding whether these changes have sufficiently improved countermeasure development and procurement.", "The 111th Congress faces several challenging policy issues. Primary among them is assessing whether Project BioShield is successfully encouraging medical countermeasure development. A second issue is whether to allow additional diversions of the Project BioShield advance appropriation, a key element of the government's market guarantee, to support other activities. A third is whether to broaden Project BioShield's mandate beyond CBRN countermeasures in the face of other threats such as pandemic influenza."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Following the terrorist attacks of 2001, the federal government determined that it would need new medical countermeasures (e.g., diagnostic tests, drugs, vaccines, and other treatments) to respond to an attack using chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) agents.

It provides the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) expedited procedures for CBRN terrorism-related spending, including procuring products, hiring experts, and awarding research grants.

The act increases the maximum amount, from $100 thousand to $25 million, for contracts awarded under simplified acquisition procedures. It also allows these purchases using other than full and open competition. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), HHS has used the simplified acquisitions procedure authority for only five contracts.

HHS has stated that it has not used its authority to use other than full and open competition.", "The Project BioShield Act authorizes the HHS Secretary to use an expedited award process for grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements related to CBRN countermeasure R&D, if the Secretary deems that a pressing need for an expedited award exists. This authority is limited to awards of $1.5 million or less. This expedited award process replaces the normal peer review process. Some scientists have expressed concerns that an expedited review process will reduce research quality. The normal peer review process is designed to provide proposals with greater scientific merit a higher probability of receiving funding, a factor potentially lost in an expedited process.", "According to the most recent data available from HHS, it awarded 14 grants through this expedited peer review process between July 2004 through July 2007.

The act allows the HHS Secretary, with the concurrence of the DHS Secretary and upon the approval of the President, to promise to buy a product up to eight years before it is reasonably expected to be delivered. Originally, a company was to be paid only on the delivery of a substantial portion of the countermeasure. The Pandemic and All-Hazard Preparedness Act ( P.L. 109-417 ) modified the Project BioShield Act to allow for milestone-based payments of up to half of the total award before delivery. Therefore, this guarantee reduces the market risk for the company and the milestone payments partially reduce its exposure to development risk (i.e., the risk that the countermeasure will fail during testing and be undeliverable). ", "The Project BioShield Act allows HHS to purchase unapproved and unlicensed countermeasures. It requires the HHS Secretary to determine that \"sufficient and satisfactory clinical experience or research data ... support[s] a reasonable conclusion that the product will qualify for approval or licensing ... within eight years.\" Because most drugs that begin these processes fail to become approved treatments, critics of this provision suggest that the government will end up purchasing countermeasures that may never be approved. To reduce the government's financial risk associated with this provision, the act allows HHS to write contracts so that unapproved products may be purchased at lower cost than approved products.

", "Congress determined that Project BioShield insufficiently encouraged the transition of promising basic research results into the product development stage. This period in development is often referred to as the \"valley of death\" for pharmaceuticals since some seemingly promising drugs are not developed past this point due to lack of funding. As discussed above, the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act amended the Project BioShield Act to allow BioShield contracts to pay up to half the contract value as milestone payments. Thus companies could receive payments while continuing to develop their promising products. Additionally, Congress created in BARDA a dedicated infrastructure to manage and fund advanced development and commercialization of CBRN countermeasures. In theory, BARDA funding can take those promising drugs from the basic research through the advanced development stage, which may include clinical trials. Congress created the Biodefense Medical Countermeasure Development Fund to pay for such advanced development contracts. Although this account is separate from the Project BioShield account in DHS, Congress has funded the advanced development account through transfers from the Project BioShield account (see Table 1 and Table 2 ).", "Critics of government programs funding advanced development suggest that because of the high product failure rate in advanced development, the government will inevitably fund unusable products. In addition to removing the development risks traditionally borne by industry, directly funding advanced development inserts government decision makers into the countermeasure development process, a role critics argue is better suited to industry experts and entrepreneurs. Some critics would prefer to have the government set product requirements and have industry determine how best to meet them. As originally enacted, Project BioShield took this latter approach, an approach that Congress found insufficient in this particular case. Because advanced development activities generally take several years, it may take several more years to determine if this change has yielded better results than the original Project BioShield.

If Congress decides to transfer the account to HHS, depending on how it is transferred, these roles may or may not be preserved. A simple transfer of the account in the absence of additional amendments of the Project BioShield Act provisions would likely maintain the current agency roles. Alternatively, Congress could amend the Project BioShield act to change the agencies' roles in contract approval.

Potential countermeasure developers considered the establishment of an advance-funded separate account dedicated solely to countermeasure procurement as integral to their participation in this program. The advance funding helped assure developers that payment for countermeasures they successfully developed would not depend on future, potentially uncertain appropriations processes. Although advance-funding the Project BioShield account may have provided some assurance of stability to developers, in practice, these funds have been subject to the annual appropriations processes. Subsequent Congresses have removed approximately 8% of the advance appropriation through rescissions and transfers to other accounts. See Table 1 . These transfers fall into two categories: those still related to CBRN countermeasures research and development and those related to influenza pandemic preparedness.

President Obama has proposed a similar transfer for FY2010 of $305 million. The Administration justifies the proposed transfer by asserting that these funds will support \"future successful acquisitions of medical countermeasures under Project BioShield.\" Thus, such transfers could be viewed as an attempt to improve the \"lower than expected\" rate of Project BioShield acquisitions. The House Committee on Appropriations reached a similar conclusion: H.R. 3293 would transfer the requested $305 million to BARDA and $500 million to NIAID to support basic research. ", "If Congress agrees to this proposed transfer, the precedent set in FY2009 that research and development funding should be viewed as linked to procurement (and that such activities should be funded by transfers from the Project BioShield special reserve fund) may be reinforced. Annual transfers from this account to fund such activity would continue to lower the amounts available for procuring CBRN countermeasures, their originally intended purpose. However, if funding becomes a limitation to acquiring countermeasures, Congress could appropriate additional money for this purpose. However, such a course of events might cause potential countermeasure developers to feel dependent on the actions of future appropriators, precisely the situation that establishment of the special reserve fund was designed to ameliorate. ", "Such funding transfers may modify the respective roles of the federal government and the private sector in Project BioShield. Congress originally designed Project BioShield to minimize the risk that the government would pay for countermeasures which fail during development (see \" Market Guarantee \" above). Developers were expected to manage this risk, using the government-market guarantee to entice investors to fund countermeasure development. Congress attempted to assure such potential investors that the funding of this program was not subject to the annual appropriations process by providing ten year advance funding. Industry spokespeople reportedly have asserted that transferring money from this account weakens the ability of private firms to raise capital necessary to sustain long-term research and development for countermeasures and hinders potential participation in Project BioShield. However, transferring the funds to support advanced development may reduce the amount that developers need to raise, since the government can directly fund the development. By shifting money from procurement to research and development, the government assumes more of the development risk (i.e., the government becomes more likely to spend money on developing countermeasures that will fail during development and never become available).

In 2007, the GAO suggested that HHS and DOD establish an inventory-sharing agreement that would allow DOD to use the HHS vaccines in its active troop vaccination program before expiration. These agencies subsequently implemented a shared stockpile approach for anthrax vaccines and pandemic influenza countermeasures. However, this shared stockpile solution is not applicable for countermeasures lacking other high-volume users. The HHS may require additional periodic countermeasure purchases to replenish the stockpile to maintain a consistent readiness level.
