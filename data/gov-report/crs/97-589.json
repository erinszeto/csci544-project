In this pursuit, the Court follows the principle that a statute be read as a harmonious whole whenever reasonable, with separate parts being interpreted within their broader statutory context.", "Still, the meaning of statutory language is not always evident. To help clarify uncertainty, judges have developed various interpretive tools in the form of canons of construction. Canons broadly fall into two types. \"Language,\" or \"linguistic,\" canons are interpretive \"rules of thumb\" for drawing inferences based on customary usage, grammar, and the like. For example, in considering the meaning of particular words and phrases, language canons call for determining the sense in which terms are being used, that is, whether words or phrases are meant as terms of art with specialized meanings or are meant in the ordinary, \"dictionary\" sense. Other language canons direct that all words of a statute be given effect if possible, that a term used more than once in a statute ordinarily be given the same meaning throughout, and that specific statutory language ordinarily trumps conflicting general language. \"Ordinarily\" is a necessary caveat, since any of these \"canons\" may give way if context points toward a contrary meaning.", "Not infrequently the Court stacks the deck, and subordinates the general, linguistic canons of statutory construction, as well as other interpretive principles, to overarching presumptions that favor particular substantive results. When one of these \"substantive\" canons applies, the Court frequently requires a \"clear statement\" of congressional intent to negate it. A commonly invoked \"substantive\" canon is that Congress does not intend to change judge-made law. Other substantive canons disfavor preemption of state law and abrogation of state immunity from suit in federal court. As another example, Congress must strongly signal an intent to the courts if it wishes to apply a statute retroactively or override existing law. The Court also tries to avoid an interpretation that would raise serious doubts about a statute's constitutionality.", "Interpretive methods that emphasize the primacy of text and staying within the boundaries of statutes themselves to discern meaning are \"textualist.\" Other approaches, including \"intentionalism,\" are more open to taking extrinsic considerations into account. Most particularly, some Justices may be willing to look to legislative history to clarify ambiguous text. This report briefly reviews what constitutes \"legislative history,\" including, possibly, presidential signing statements, and the factors that might lead the Court to consider it."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution vests all federal legislative power in Congress, while Article I, Section 7 sets forth the process for effectuating this power through passage of legislation by both houses and either presidential approval or veto override. The exercise of the judicial power of the United States often requires that courts construe statutes so enacted to apply them in concrete cases and controversies. Judicial interpretation of a statute is authoritative in the matter before the court, and may guide courts in future cases. Beyond this, the methodologies and approaches taken by the courts in interpreting meaning also can help guide legislative drafters, legislators, implementing agencies, and private parties.", "This report provides an overview of how the Supreme Court approaches statutory interpretation, with particular emphasis on rules and conventions that focus on the text itself. That is, to inform Congress on how the Court might go about analyzing the meaning of particular legislative language, this report emphasizes \"textualist\"-based means of interpretation. \"Textualism\" considers the \"law\" to be embodied in the language of the statute, construed according to its \"plain meaning,\" which can be discerned through the aid, as necessary, of various judicially developed rules of interpretation. As put by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in an oft-quoted aphorism: \"We do not inquire what the legislature meant; we ask only what the statute means.\" \"Textualism,\" as captured in Justice Holmes' quote, eschews explanatory legislative materials, and inferences drawn from them and other extrinsic sources, in applying statutory language to particular circumstances. ", "Despite its currency in recent decades, \"textualism\" is not the exclusive means of statutory analysis, and this report also briefly discusses \"intentionalist\"-based means of interpretation and the Court's approach toward relying on legislative history and other extrinsic considerations. This report is not intended as an examination of all schools of judicial decision making, or as an analysis of the merits or limits of the many methodologies used by courts in applying statutes in specific cases. In this regard, even though textualism may be the primary approach toward interpreting statutes, individual Supreme Court opinions often employ multiple types of statutory analysis to support their conclusions and critique majority/dissenting opinions with which they do not agree. Moreover, as general approaches for inferring meaning, neither textualism nor intentionalism is rigidly mechanistic or limited to the action of the enacting Congress, with \"textualists,\" for example, sometimes looking to broader legal contexts and \"intentionalists\" at times venturing beyond the enacting Congress's particular intent to preserve a statute's purposes.", "When reading statutory text, the Supreme Court uses content-neutral canons developed by the judiciary that focus on word usage, grammar, syntax and the like. Sometimes, the Court also brings to bear various presumptions that reflect broader judicial concerns and can more directly favor particular substantive results. Other conventions assist the Court in determining whether to go beyond the corners of a statute and judicial-based rules of interpretation to also consider the congressional deliberations that led to a statute's passage. Although there is some overlap and inconsistency among these rules and conventions, and although the Court's pathway through the mix is often not clearly foreseeable, an understanding of interpretational possibilities may nonetheless aid Congress in choosing among various drafting options. To this end, the Court has expressed an interest \"that Congress be able to legislate against a background of clear interpretive rules, so that it may know the effect of the language it adopts.\"", "Of course, Congress can always amend a statute to supersede the reading given it by the Court. In interpreting statutes, the Court recognizes that legislative power resides in Congress, and that Congress can legislate away interpretations with which it disagrees. Congress has revisited statutory issues fairly frequently to override or counter the Court's interpretations. Corrective amendment can be a lengthy and uncertain process, however."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Statutory Text", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "In General\u2014Statutory Context and Purpose", "paragraphs": ["The starting point in construing a statute is the language of the statute itself. The Supreme Court often recites the \"plain meaning rule,\" that, if the language of the statute is plain and unambiguous, it must be applied according to its terms. There is no single test to assay the clarity of statutory language. The interpretive process frequently begins with a narrow focus on the meaning of particular words and phrases. This view is commonly supplemented by perspectives provided from elsewhere within the statute. How has Congress used or distinguished the same terms in other places in the statute? How does the section containing the language at issue fit within the statute's structure? What do the structure and language of a statute reveal about the statute's overall purposes?", "The primacy of text in statutory analysis would appear to marginalize whatever insight legislative history or other extrinsic aids might provide. The strictures of a text-based \"plain meaning rule\" were once thought honored more in the breach than in the observance. However, this perception has changed: More often than before, statutory text is thought to be the ending point as well as the starting point for interpretation.", "Under text-based analysis, the cardinal rule of construction is that the whole statute should be drawn upon as necessary, with its various parts being interpreted within their broader statutory context in a manner that furthers statutory purposes. Justice Scalia, who was in the vanguard of efforts to redirect statutory construction toward statutory text and away from legislative history, has characterized this general approach. \"Statutory construction ... is a holistic endeavor. A provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme\u2014because the same terminology is used elsewhere in a context that makes its meaning clear, or because only one of the permissible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.\" In 1850 Chief Justice Taney described the same process: \"In expounding a statute, we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy.\" Thus, the meaning of a specific statutory directive may be shaped, for example, by that statute's definitions of terms, by the statute's statement of findings and purposes, by the directive's relationship to other specific directives, by purposes inferred from those directives or from the statute as a whole, and by the statute's overall structure. Beyond this, courts also may look to the broader body of law into which the enactment fits. Nevertheless, realities of the legislative process, including bundled deal making and consolidation of multiple proposals into omnibus bills, may militate against unstinting application of \"whole act\" or \"whole code\" methodologies. ", "The Supreme Court often cites general rules, or canons, of construction in resolving statutory meaning. The Court, moreover, presumes \"that Congress legislates with knowledge of our basic rules of statutory construction.\" It is well to keep in mind, however, that the overriding objective of statutory construction has been to effectuate statutory purpose as expressed in a law's text. As Justice Jackson put it 68 years ago, \"[h]owever well these rules may serve at times to decipher legislative intent, they long have been subordinated to the doctrine that courts will construe the details of an act in conformity with its dominating general purpose, will read text in the light of context and will interpret the text so far as the meaning of the words fairly permits so as to carry out in particular cases the generally expressed legislative policy.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "\"Language\" Canons of Construction", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "In General", "paragraphs": ["The \"language\" canons of construction are neutral, analytical guides for discerning the meaning of particular text that might otherwise appear unclear. That is to say, these canons are based on general linguistic principles, many of them of the common-sense variety, for drawing inferences about the meaning of language. The meaning of a word or phrase can be shaped by its ordinary or specialized meaning, its context in the statute, the usage of similar terms in the statute, the statute's structure, and other factors. The language canons are \"axioms of experience,\" but none \"preclude[s] consideration of persuasive [contrary] evidence if it exists.\" Each canon provides its own perspective, and different takes from different views can give different insights into the meaning of what is being observed. Considering and weighing the value of various views would appear to be a sound process for ensuring well-reasoned interpretations. However, the language canons are intrinsic aids only, not \"rules of law.\" Discerning what Congress probably meant by particular language for the purpose of applying it to a particular set of facts can be a difficult judicial exercise that is not amenable to formulaic resolution. ", "The sheer number and variety of canons have been cited to emphasize their limited utility as a stand-alone method of statutory construction. Still influential, for example, is a 1950 article by Professor Karl Llewellyn that lists many canons (both language canons and substantive canons) juxtaposed to equally \"correct\" but opposing canons. Professor Llewellyn's main point was to argue that judges should take current circumstances into account in applying a statute in a case\u2014he was critical of the impression that \"formalism\" gave of there being \"only one single correct answer possible\" in reading text. Nevertheless, many have broadened his message into a charge that canons are mere pretext because judges may pick and choose among them to achieve whatever result they desire.", "However, accepting that there may be more than one \"correct\" answer in resolving the meaning of a statutory provision\u2014a premise that seems unremarkable in many cases at the Supreme Court level \u2014does not necessarily mean that a Court majority begins with a preferred policy outcome and then marshals only those canons that support it. Given an array of established templates to guide interpretation, one may be a particularly apt fit in a given case, and the case's outcome will in large measure be driven by the rationale of the canon applied. This might particularly be so when a substantive canon of interpretation (e.g., avoidance of constitutional issues) is in play. (These canons are discussed below.)", "In any event, one possible suggestion of the indeterminacy of canons is that statutory construction should be a narrow pursuit, not a broader one:", "[C]anons of construction are no more than rules of thumb that help courts determine the meaning of legislation, and in interpreting a statute a court should always turn first to one, cardinal canon before all others.... [C]ourts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.

In this exercise, a threshold inquiry is whether language is being used in the \"ordinary,\" \"general dictionary\" sense or in a narrower, specialized sense or as a term of art. Also, the appropriate reference is what a term meant to Members when Congress passed the statute, not its meaning at the time the statute is being adjudicated."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Terms of Art", "paragraphs": ["If the word or phrase is defined in the statute (federal statutes frequently collect definitions in a \"definitions\" section), or elsewhere in the United States Code , then that definition governs if applicable in the context used.

In each of these situations the accepted meaning governs and the word or phrase is considered a technical term or \"term of art.\" Justice Jackson explained why this reliance is appropriate:", "[W]here Congress borrows terms of art in which are accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of centuries of practice, it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in the body of learning from which it was taken and the meaning its use will convey to the judicial mind unless otherwise instructed.

At times, the ordinary meaning of a term in an everyday dictionary has prevailed over an interpretation given to a term in circuit court precedents. ", "Of course application of dictionary definitions is not always a clear course; many words have several meanings, and context must guide choice among them, where possible. However, \"[a]mbiguity is a creature not of definitional possibilities but of statutory context.\" Consider two cases in which context did not clearly point to whether a term was to be given its broadest dictionary meaning or was to be construed narrowly according to \"common understanding.\" In one case, the Supreme Court concluded that \"use of a firearm\" in the commission of a drug offense or crime of violence included trading a gun for drugs; that is, \"use of a firearm\" was not confined to its use as a weapon. This conclusion may be compared to a finding that purchasing drugs over a cell phone did not constitute the felony of \"facilitating\" drug trafficking through a communication device: \"[S]tatutes are not read as a collection of isolated phrases ... 'A word in a statute may or may not extend to the outer limits of its definitional possibilities.' We think the word here does not.\" In close cases such as these, the Court may go beyond the words of a statute for guidance and look to the statute's broader purpose or its fit with other laws.

The act directed that the clock stop for \"[a]ny period of delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant, including but not limited to ... (D) delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through conclusion....\" The Court held that this directive could not include time expended preparing motions: despite \"delays from other proceedings\" not being limited to those contained in a list of illustrative subparagraphs, the specific language in subparagraph (D) on delays due to pretrial motions, beginning with their being filed , left no room for delays related to preparing motions prior to their being filed. As with other canons, context is critical.", "Another interpretational guide used from time to time is the principle noscitur a sociis , that \"words grouped in a list should be given related meaning.\" Thus, a tax provision that advantaged \"income resulting from exploration, discovery, or prospecting\" was held not to apply to income derived from patented cameras and pharmaceuticals that the taxpayers had \"discovered.\" \"Discovery,\" as used in conjunction with \"exploration\" and \"prospecting,\" limited the scope of \"discovery\" to activities associated with oil and mineral extraction. Similarly, the Court inferred that \"defalcation\" in a bankruptcy code provision required an element of intentional wrongdoing based on its placement in the phrase \"fraud [,] defalcation ..., embezzlement or larceny.\" Because \"fraud,\" \"embezzlement,\" and \"larceny\" require intentional wrongdoing, \"defalcation\" presumably is similarly intended.", "On the other hand, the term \"administrative\" in the phrase \"a congressional, administrative, or Government Accounting Office [sic] report, hearing, audit or investigation\" was held to extend beyond federal administrative entities to include the work of state bodies as well. Similarly, the term \"report\" in the same phrase was broadly construed to cover raw copies of contractor documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act: the placement of \"report\" within a list including \"hearings, audits, and investigations\" did not, as the Second Circuit had concluded, limit \"reports\" to materials that also analyzed, synthesized, or explained the information presented. As with other language canons, noscitur a sociis can be a factor in interpretation, but \"is by no means a hard and fast rule....\"", "A corollary, ejusdem generis , instructs that, \"where general words follow an enumeration of specific items, the general words are read as applying only to other items akin to those specifically enumerated.\" Thus, an exemption from arbitration for \"contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in ... commerce\" did not apply to the case of a salesperson at a consumer electronics store: only contracts for the employment of individuals who transported goods and materials were to be exempted.

Verb tense and the like count. But, as with other interpretive challenges, more than one grammatical principle potentially might apply, and these principles might point to different interpretations. The interpreter is left with a choice of which principle applies most aptly. As an example, first consider the \"rule of the last antecedent.\" That rule holds that a limiting clause or phrase should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows. One application of this rule looked at language that denies SSI disability to an individual who is able to \"do his previous work ... or engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.\" The claimant's job as an elevator operator had been eliminated, and her subsequent SSI application rested in part on the assertion that elevator operator work no longer existed in significant numbers in the national economy. A unanimous Court upheld the government's position that the claimant was ineligible for SSI if she was physically capable of doing elevator operator work at all: the phrase \"which exists in the national economy\" applied only to \"other kind of substantial gainful work.\"", "Distinct from the rule of the last antecedent is a principle enunciated in Port Rico Railway, Light & Power Co. v. Mor : \"When several words are followed by a clause which is applicable as much to the first and other words as the last, the natural construction of the language demands that the clause be read as applicable to all.\" A provision of the federal criminal code mandates restitution for the full amount of the victim's losses, which are defined to include five specific types of loss ( e.g. , medical costs, lost income) and \"any other losses suffered by the victim as a proximate result of the offense.\" The Court held that the phrase \"as a proximate result of the offense\" modified each of the five separately listed types of losses.", "Though refusal always to be bound by the rules of grammar and punctuation gives the Court flexibility in construing statutes, this is not to say that grammatical rules should be disregarded in statutory drafting.

To say that Congress did not use the most precise language, however, does not necessarily aid the court in determining what the less precise language means in its statutory context. Some statutes may not be well drafted, but others represent conscious choices, born of political compromise, that may or may not signal that a different result is intended or that Congress is leaving final interpretation to agencies, courts, or future legislatures.

An inference drawn from congressional silence certainly cannot be credited when it is contrary to all other textual and contextual evidence of congressional intent.", "Occasionally, the Court does regard silence as a significant indicator of meaning, especially when Congress has consistently used particular language in similar laws. Nevertheless, the Court generally assumes Congress will speak to major issues directly: \"Congress ... does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions\u2014it does not ... hide elephants in mouseholes.\" Thus, when the Court held that the FDA's authority did not include authority to regulate tobacco products as drugs, it stated: \"Congress could not have intended to delegate a decision of such economic and political significance to an agency in so cryptic a fashion.\"", "A variation on the statutory silence theme is the negative inference: expressio unius est exclusio alterius (the inclusion of one is the exclusion of others). Thus, where Congress subjected specific categories of ticket sales to taxation but failed to cover another category, either by specific or by general language, the Court refused to extend the coverage. To do so, given the \"particularization and detail\" with which Congress had set out the categories, would amount to \"enlargement\" of the statute rather than \"construction\" of it. Relatedly, \"[w]here Congress explicitly enumerates certain exceptions to a general prohibition, additional exceptions are not to be implied, in the absence of a contrary legislative intent.\" The Court applied the principle, albeit without express recognition, in holding that a statute requiring payment of an attendance fee to \"a witness\" applies to an incarcerated state prisoner who testifies at a federal trial. Because Congress had expressly excepted another category (detained aliens) from eligibility for these fees, and had expressly excepted any \"incarcerated\" witness from eligibility for a different category of fees, \"the conclusion is virtually inescapable ... that the general language 'witness in attendance' ... includes prisoners ....\"", "But here again, context may render the principle inapplicable.

A majority of the Court found that costs could indeed be awarded in these cases. According to the Court, the expressio unius cannon only applies when it is fair to assume that Congress considered broader coverage but rejected it.

Similarly, when Congress adopted the common law on abandonment of property as part of the Bankruptcy Code, it was deemed to have adopted all the judge-made corollaries and exceptions that attended the abandonment law: \"The normal rule of statutory construction is that if Congress intends for legislation to change the interpretation of a judicially created concept, it makes that intent specific.\" In another bankruptcy case the Court declared that \"[w]e will not read the Bankruptcy Code to erode past ... practice absent a clear indication that Congress intended such a departure.\" Further, the Court held that Congress, in adopting language stating that a patent is presumed valid, concomitantly adopted the common law rule that the presumed validity of a patent may be overcome only by clear and convincing evidence.

In some instances, the presumption of continuation has been overcome by general reference to a statute's purpose, even absent a \"clear statement.\" In other instances, the Justices have disagreed on whether particular language sufficiently evidences an intent to overcome the presumption: Does language in the Federal Employers' Liability Act making railroads liable for employee injuries \"resulting in whole or in part from [carrier] negligence\" supersede (and relax) common law rules limiting liability to injuries arising from a \"proximate cause\"?

Also, the Court tends to construe preclusions narrowly. Thus, even where a statute has barred judicial review of the merits of individual cases, the Court nevertheless has found that the regulations and practices for determining cases may be reviewed.", "While the presumption of reviewability predated the enactment of the Administrative Procedure Act in 1946, the APA embodied the presumption in statute. Under the APA, final agency actions for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court are subject to judicial review, \"except to the extent that ... statutes preclude judicial review; or ... agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.\" As to the first exception, the presumption of reviewability may be overcome by specific statutory language, but it also \"may be overcome by inferences of intent drawn from the statutory scheme as a whole.\" The second exception applies \"in those rare instances where 'statutes are drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply.'\"", "An aspect of the second exception is that \"review is not to be had if the statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency's exercise of discretion.\" Thus, the Court in Webster v. Doe looked at the structure of the National Security Act and language allowing the Director of Central Intelligence to terminate an employee as the Director deemed necessary or advisable, and concluded that a court could not, as a general matter, review the necessity or advisability of terminating an employee based on sexual orientation. But, as in many other judicial review cases, the Webster Court was very precise as to what review a statute foreclosed. Though the Court found decisions on whether a dismissal was necessary or advisable resided with the Director alone, this discretion did not go so far as to preclude court consideration of colorable constitutional claims arising from the actions of the Director. In the Court's view, a clearer statement from Congress is necessary before courts should refrain from reviewing constitutional claims of administrative error.

Executive agencies charged with implementing regulatory statutes adopt policies and processes to put statutes into action. Agency decisions might set operational rules of general application or might arise during agency adjudications; they might be the result of more or less formal processes; they might purport to be more or less binding. But they all involve interpreting the law to some degree, and courts considering challenges to agency decision making face the issue of how much to defer to an agency reading of the law or to proceed to interpret the law on their own.", "Under current precedent, when a court reviews an agency's formal interpretation of a statute that the agency administers, and when the statute has not removed agency discretion by compelling a particular disposition of the matter at issue, courts defer to any reasonable agency interpretation. This is the Chevron rule announced in 1984. In two decisions, one in 2000 and one in 2001, the Court clarified and narrowed Chevron's application, ruling that Chevron deference applies only if an agency's interpretation is the product of a formal agency process, such as adjudication or notice and comment rulemaking, through which Congress has authorized the agency \"to speak with the force of law.\" Other agency interpretations that are made without a formal and public process often are reviewed under pre- Chevron principles set forth in Skidmore v. Swift & Co . Additional variations of deference analysis also may come into play in individual cases, depending on subject matter and other factors.", "As in other matters of interpretation, it is congressional intent that counts. Under Chevron , the first question is \"whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\" If the court, \"employing the traditional tools of statutory construction,\" determines that Congress has addressed the precise issue, then that is the end of the matter, because the \"law must be given effect.\" However, if the statute does not directly address the issue, \"the court does not simply impose its own construction of the statute,\" but rather determines \"whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\"", "On its face, the Chevron rule is quite deferential, and was perceived as a significant break from the multi-factored approach that preceded it. One would expect that a court's conclusion as to whether Congress has \"directly spoken\" to the issue would be decisive in most cases, that most of the myriad of issues that can arise in the administrative setting would not be directly addressed by statute, and that, consequently, courts would most often defer to what are found to be \"reasonable\" agency interpretations. However, Chevron did not usher in a sea change of increased deference by the Supreme Court. The Court has frequently determined that in fact Congress has settled the matter, and that consequently there is no need to proceed to the second, more deferential step of the inquiry. The Court has also found that, even though Congress has left the matter for agency resolution, the agency's interpretation is unreasonable. ", "In determining whether Congress has \"directly spoken,\" there is much territory between an express delegation to an agency to address a particular issue and express legislative language resolving the issue statutorily. Imprecision on an issue may reflect an oversight by Congress, a failure to anticipate what might arise, a political compromise, an implicit assumption that the gap would be filled in by the agency with technical expertise, or other considerations. With this in mind, the Court has recognized circumstances in which it is less likely that Congress intended to leave resolution of statutory uncertainty to the administering agency, especially when it appears that the agency may be citing vague terms to justify jurisdiction over controversial matters with major policy implications traditionally resolved by Congress or another agency. Thus, in holding that the Food and Drug Administration lacked authority to regulate tobacco products as \"drugs\" and \"devices\" under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Court concluded that \"Congress could not have intended to delegate a decision of such economic and political significance to an agency in so cryptic a fashion.\" The Court ruled that Congress had \"directly spoken\" to the regulatory issue\u2014not through the FDCA itself, but rather through subsequently enacted tobacco-specific legislation and through rejection of legislative proposals to confer jurisdiction on the FDA. In another case, the Court found deference to be inappropriate where the agency interpretation \"invokes the outer limits of Congress' power,\" and there is no \"clear indication\" that Congress intended that result.", "A logical consequence of applying Chevron is to render irrelevant whether an agency interpretation was \"contemporaneous\" with a statute's enactment, or whether an agency's position has been consistent over the years. \"Neither antiquity nor contemporaneity with the statute is a condition of validity.\" The fact that an agency has changed its position over the years \"is not fatal,\" because \"the whole point of Chevron is to leave the discretion provided by the ambiguities of a statute with the implementing agency.\"", "Agency interpretations that take place in the many less formal contexts where Chevron deference is inapplicable (e.g., opinion letters, policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines, \"all of which lack the force of law\" ) can still be \"entitled to respect,\" \"but only to the extent that [they] have the power to persuade.\" As the Court put it in Skidmore v. Swift & Co. , agency interpretations \"constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort.... The weight of such a judgment in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.\" These factors may include whether an interpretation applied technical expertise on a complex matter within agency jurisdiction, whether an agency's decision was well-reasoned, and whether the agency's interpretation was longstanding or consistent.

Textualists regard the words embodied in the text of a statute as the \"law\": \"Congress' intent is found in the words it has chosen to use.\" Intentionalism and related methods are less sanguine about whether statutory language alone can fully and adequately embody the \"law\" for purposes of applying statutes in individual cases. Yet textualists on occasion recognize the value of extrinsic perspectives, and intentionalists regard statutory language as the analytical starting point and at least strong evidence of what a law intends.", "The primacy of text in discerning meaning is expressed in the \"plain meaning rule.\" That rule holds that where the language of a statute is plain, the sole role of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms. In practice, the cases vary in characterizing the rule as mandatory or prudential, and those differences often play out indirectly through arguments about whether particular language is sufficiently clear and unambiguous to preclude further inquiry.", "There seems to be general consensus that the plain meaning rule aptly characterizes interpretational priorities (statutory language is primary, other considerations of intent and purpose secondary). However, agreement on the basic meaning of the plain meaning rule\u2014if it occurs\u2014does not guarantee agreement in the rule's application. There have been cases in which Justices of the Supreme Court have agreed that the statutory provision at issue is plain, but have split 5-4 over what that plain meaning is. There are other cases in which strict application is simply ignored; courts, after concluding that the statutory language is plain, nonetheless look to legislative history, either to confirm that plain meaning, or to refute arguments that a contrary interpretation was \"intended.\" The one generally recognized exception to the rule is that a plain meaning is rejected if it would produce an \"absurd result.\" Nevertheless, even in cases of \"absurd results\" Justices can disagree over whether it is appropriate to consult legislative materials for interpretational insight.", "The commonest bridge from text to legislative history is a finding that the statutory language is not plain, but instead is unclear or \"ambiguous.\" Significant differences arise, however, in the willingness of courts to label particular statutory language as \"ambiguous\" and thereby resort to legislative history. Some judges are more sanguine than others in the ability to interpret statutory text without resort to the \"extrinsic\" aid of legislative history. Some judges limit themselves to a narrow focus on the clarity or ambiguity of a particular statutory phrase, while others look more broadly to statutory context for insight into phrases that may seem ambiguous in isolation. And, inevitably, tensions may arise between apparently clear language and perceived intent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Uses of Legislative History", "paragraphs": ["Over time, the Court has by turns been relatively more receptive or skeptical toward mining the legislative process for insight into a statute's meaning. Legislating is a collective exercise. Drafters seek to capture a sponsor's intent in words, however imperfectly. Language introduced as legislation is subjected to examination, criticism and revision in diverse congressional fora\u2014large and small, formal and informal\u2014as it moves toward approval\u2014again, via diverse groups with varying degrees of expertise and interest\u2014and eventual enactment into law. Particularly since the 1980s, some Court opinions have characterized modern congressional processes as too fractured to admit any statement or explanation made in any step along the way as an authoritative declaration by Congress as a whole (assuming Congress had a discernible \"collective understanding\" on the matter at issue before the Court in the first place ). Adding to this reluctance is the perception of some that the published history could be skewed by the partisanship of committee staff, the manipulation of interest groups, or the dominant influence of federal agencies. It is preferable, under this view, to re-focus on the statutory text to gain some space for judicial independence and clarity. ", "More recently, some commentators and jurists who look at congressional processes have had a different take. They, too, see complexity and fragmentation in Congress, but argue that one can ascribe an \"institutional purpose\" to legislation even though the motives of individual legislators may be unknown or unknowable. Under this \"busy Congress\" model, for example, congressional committees, as specialists in their field, are regarded as reporting accurate accounts of information and insight to their respective chambers so that Members may better consider legislation they have limited knowledge of.", "The stuff of legislative history itself potentially comprises a wide variety of materials. On the one hand, a current statute may be compared to its predecessors and differences among their language and structure analyzed. This use is limited to examining language passed by Congress, which, unlike materials attending congressional deliberations, is often thought to best reflect the intent of Congress as a whole. Considering past statutes and their evolution is not a particularly controversial exercise. On the other hand are the committee reports, hearings, floor debates, and other records of deliberations and correspondence on legislation as it moves through the legislative process. One aspect of examining this material can be to compare different versions of a provision as it progresses, a use somewhat like the comparing of statutes to their predecessors, but without each version having been approved by Congress as a whole.", "Courts may read contemporaneous congressional materials for many reasons: background information and context, explanations of specific legislative language, or expectations of how a provision will be applied to the particular fact situation before them. Reliance on these materials varies among courts, with the circumstances of a statute's passage and its clarity or complexity being factors. Courts also may be more willing to consult committee reports and the like for insight into the particular problem Congress sought to address than they are to consult language that purports to direct certain interpretations or outcomes. The nature of the issue before a court is another variable that may bear on what materials the court uses and why. ", "Among published history, some sources may be considered relatively more authoritative. As a rule, committee report explanations, and especially those of conference committees, are considered more persuasive and reliable than statements made during floor debates or hearings. Within floor debates, statements of sponsors and explanations by floor managers are usually accorded the most weight, and statements by other committee members of the reporting committee[s] next. Floor statements by Members not associated with sponsorship or committee consideration of a bill have little weight, and statements by bill opponents less weight still. Hearings may be useful in providing background, less so as to illuminating the meaning of particular language.", "This hierarchy generally characterizes where a court might go to seek to clarify an unclear statute, but several factors might tip the scales in favor of one bit of history or another of a particular bill. Final language might have arisen from a floor amendment, in which case earlier reports and debates may be of interest only as a point of contrast. Similarly, final language might have been added by the second chamber to consider a bill, in which case the history developed in it would be most pertinent, especially absent conference consideration. Also, a court's willingness to delve into the more remote reaches of legislative history can vary with the issue at hand and the point sought to be clarified.", "Again, courts may consult explanatory documents to gain a better feel for context or to shed light on particular language. Reference to legislative history for background is commonplace. A \"proper construction frequently requires consideration of [a statute's] wording against the background of its legislative history and in the light of the general objectives Congress sought to achieve.\" Looking to published history to help explain the meaning of statutory terms may be more controversial, either because contrary indications may be present in other passages of legislative history, or because the degree of direction or detail may be an unwarranted narrowing of a more general statutory text. The concern in the latter instances is whether the legislative history is a plausible explanation of language actually contained in the statutory text, or whether instead explanatory language (e.g., report language containing committee directives or \"understandings\") outpaces that text. As the Court observed in rejecting reliance on \"excerpts\" said to reflect congressional intent to preempt state law, \"we have never [looked for] congressional intent in a vacuum, unrelated to the giving of meaning to an enacted statutory text ... [U]nenacted approvals, beliefs, and desires are not laws.\"", "A distinct but related inquiry focuses not on the explanations that accompanied committee or floor consideration, but rather on the sequence of changes in bill language. Consideration of the \"specific history of the legislative process that culminated in the [statute at issue] affords ... solid ground for giving it appropriate meaning\" and for resolving ambiguity present in statutory text. Selection of one house's version over that of the other house may be significant. In some circumstances rejection of an amendment or earlier version can be important, but there is no general \"rejected proposal rule.\" While courts are naturally reluctant to attribute significance to the failure of Congress to act, that reluctance may be overcome if it can be shown that Congress considered and rejected bill language that would have adopted the very position being urged upon the court.", "Even more than in the case of legislative language, discussed above, silence in the published legislative history of a bill is seldom significant. There is no requirement that \"every permissible application of a statute be expressly referred to in its legislative history.\" The Court does, however, occasionally attach importance to the absence of any indication in a statute or its legislative history of an intent to effect a \"major change\" in well-established law.

But it may not always be evident exactly how far Congress went in subsequent legislation to sweep aside an earlier construction. For example, when Congress acts narrowly against a result in a Court decision, is it also discrediting the Court's reasoning that led to the result? A female employee who is adversely affected by a discriminatory seniority system is barred from relief under a Supreme Court decision that holds Title VII's statute of limitation clock is intended to tick solely from the time of the discriminatory act, not from the time harm is realized. Congress adopts a provision that specifies time of harm as restarting the statute of limitations clock for those discriminated against under a seniority system. Later, a female brings suit alleging that she had been discriminated against in raise decisions over time and that consequently her pay continued to be lower than that of men in similar positions. Is the Court's more general \"time of the act\" interpretation in the seniority case still to be accorded weight in the later raise discrimination case, even though the interpretation no longer pertains in a seniority system context?

Though the presumption can come into play in the absence of evidence that Congress directly considered the issue at hand, the Court may require other indicia of congressional awareness of the issue before reading significance into reenactment.

Also, the President may not amend the language of a presented bill before acting on it. Nor may the President pick and choose which provisions of a presented bill to sign into law, while vetoing others. The President's options are \"thumbs up\" or \"thumbs down\" on a bill in its entirety. The President may have an integral role in the enactment of statutes into law, but \"[a]ll legislative Powers\" reside in Congress, and it is exclusively up to the houses of Congress, at least formally, to come to common agreement on statutory language.", "Nevertheless, recent Presidents have frequently used the occasion of signing a bill into law to issue statements that contend that portions of the bill are unconstitutional, claim a law is of limited application, or otherwise signal that a law will be implemented strictly in accord with the President's views of the office's prerogatives and authorities. Assertions in signing statements vary in specificity and purported scope; the statements would not appear to have any immediate, direct legal effect in and of themselves; and they may best be understood in the context of the enduring tension between the political branches over accountability, control of executive agencies, and similar institutional concerns. At the same time, Administrations since the 1980s have asserted that signing statements have weight as legislative history and should be taken into account by courts. There is no legal impediment to a President commenting on a statute's meaning in a signing statement, and the political reality is that an Administration is not a passive spectator during congressional deliberations. Often, the Administration forwards draft legislation for introduction, and liaisons from the executive branch regularly communicate its views on bills as they proceed. If the President or the Administration worked closely with Congress in developing legislation, and if the approved version incorporated the President's recommendations, reference to a signing statement arguably may help complete the picture of a bill's purpose, especially in the absence of published congressional documents on a bill. The same might also be said with respect to bills whose final content arose from compromise negotiations between the Administration and Congress.", "Citation of signing statements may be more controversial when statutory language appears clear or the meaning attributed in a signing statement conflicts with congressional history. Congress has no opportunity during the legislative process to respond as an institution to a characterization in a signing statement. Giving the President \"the last word\" on the meaning of a bill he approves, it may be pointed out, stands in contrast to the procedure for congressional consideration of the President's objections in the case of a vetoed bill.", "The Supreme Court has not accorded legal weight to signing statements. And, in longstanding litigation on a statute implicating the status of Jerusalem, the prominence of President George W. Bush's signing statement as an issue has steadily declined. Neither the latest court of appeals decision, nor recent briefs by the parties to the Supreme Court, do more than mention it in passing as part of the case's history. Also, lower courts have seldom had to resolve cases that require a choice between conflicting presidential and congressional interpretations. Presidents' routine use of signing statements to try to influence statutory interpretation by courts is a relatively recent development. Thus far, courts have not been particularly receptive, even while citing them on occasion.", "Judicial reluctance to consider signing statements would not appear to be contrary to judicial deference to agency action. Deference is premised on the conclusion that Congress has, by statute, authorized the agency to \"speak with the force of law\" through a rulemaking or other formal process. Congress has not authorized the President (or, indirectly, an agency) to speak with the force of law through signing statements. So, although signing statements may influence or even control agency implementation of statutes, it is the implementation, and not the signing statement itself, that would be measured against the statute's requirements. At most, signing statements might be considered analogous to informal agency actions, entitled to respect only to the extent that they have the power to persuade."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
