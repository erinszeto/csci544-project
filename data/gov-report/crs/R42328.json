The decision to grant the waiver is left to the Secretary's discretion.", "This broad waiver authority was initially included in the ESEA through the Improving America's Schools Act ( P.L. 103-382 ). The authority was retained through enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB; P.L. 107-110 ), the most recent amendments to the ESEA. The Secretary has used the authority provided under Section 9401 to grant numerous waivers over time, including waivers of accountability and general administrative requirements. For example, since the enactment of NCLB, the Secretary has granted waivers of various ESEA requirements in response to the Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005 and to address issues raised by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5 ). ", "On June 13, 2011, the Secretary announced that he might begin to use the authority provided under Section 9401 to issue broad sweeping waivers if Congress fails to reauthorize the ESEA. Subsequently, on August 8, 2011, it was announced at a White House press briefing that President Obama had directed the Secretary to \"move forward with plans to provide flexibility to states.\" On September 23, 2011, President Obama and the Secretary of Education formally announced the availability of an ESEA flexibility package for states that included 11 waivers of ESEA requirements, as well as four principles for \"improving student academic achievement and increasing the quality of instruction\" that must be met to receive the waivers. With the exception of one optional waiver, state educational agencies (SEAs) applying for the ESEA flexibility must apply for all 10 waivers and must agree to implement all four principles related to receiving the waivers.

", "The Administration has argued that the ESEA flexibility package is needed because Congress has failed to reauthorize the ESEA. The ESEA was authorized through FY2008; however, ESEA programs continue to receive annual appropriations. The Administration has suggested that this lack of congressional action is particularly an issue as there are requirements contained in the ESEA, including academic accountability requirements, that have become problematic for state educational agencies, local educational agencies (LEAs), and schools to implement, and various states have sought waivers of these provisions. A commonly cited problem is that under the performance-based accountability provisions enacted in NCLB, all students are expected to perform at a proficient level on state administered reading/language arts and mathematics assessments by the end of the 2013-2014 school year. As this deadline approaches, and performance expectations under the law increase, an increasing share of the nation's schools are failing to meet adequate yearly progress (AYP)\u2014the measure that determines whether a school is or is not meeting the academic accountability requirements. There is broad concern that states and LEAs may become increasingly taxed with regard to their ability to undertake required activities to help schools that fail to make AYP.", "This report begins with a general discussion of the ESEA flexibility package and current congressional efforts to reauthorize the ESEA. Also included is an update on state applications for the ESEA flexibility package.

The next section of the report provides an examination of how the Secretary has used waiver authority in the past and a legal analysis of the scope of the Secretary's waiver authority and the Secretary's authority to grant a waiver in exchange for another action. The next part of the report focuses on describing and analyzing the waivers and related principles that collectively comprise the Administration's ESEA flexibility package. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "General Discussion of the ESEA Flexibility Package2", "paragraphs": ["Taken together, the waivers and accompanying principles included in the ESEA flexibility package being offered to SEAs could be viewed as a fundamental redesign of key elements of the ESEA. Through the use of secretarial authority to waive various ESEA provisions, the ESEA flexibility package being offered by ED would alter the existing accountability requirements under Title I-A in such a way that they would have little resemblance to the accountability requirements included in statute. For example, requisite adoption of college- and career-ready standards that are either common to a \"significant\" number of states or that have been approved by a state network of institutions of higher education (IHEs) is not in current law. Rather, this is a new condition that would be placed on SEAs by the Administration. Under current law, states are required to implement accountability systems that establish content and performance standards in reading/language arts and mathematics and include aligned assessments that are administered annually in grades 3-8 and once in grades 10-12. States are also required to have content and performance standards and aligned assessments in science that are administered once in grades 3-5, 6-9, and 10-12. In meeting these requirements, states have the latitude to independently select their own content and performance standards and assessments. There are no requirements that the standards be \"college- and career-ready\" standards or be approved by a state network of IHEs. ", "The ESEA flexibility package would also eliminate the requirement that all schools receiving Title I-A funds that fail to make AYP for at least two consecutive years be required to implement a series of increasingly severe outcome accountability requirements. Rather, prescribed interventions would be limited to the lowest performing 5% of schools (priority schools) and some type of intervention would be required in the next lowest performing 10% of schools (focus schools). The outcome accountability requirements that currently apply to all Title I-A schools that fail to meet AYP would be replaced by more prescriptive requirements for priority schools and a requirement for non-specified interventions to be implemented in focus schools. The mechanisms used to identify schools in need of intervention would no longer be based solely on whether the school made AYP. Rather, other measures could be taken into account in making these decisions. Finally, the identification of schools as priority schools would be based on the performance of all students in the school or student graduation rates rather than the performance of individual subgroups. Under current law, the performance of all students, the performance of subgroups of students, and graduation rates are taken into account in determining AYP.", "The ESEA flexibility package would also substantially alter accountability requirements applicable to educators. While current law focuses on having highly qualified teachers, the ESEA flexibility package would alter existing teacher requirements to focus on teacher (and school leader) effectiveness, determined, in part, based on student achievement. To date, no provisions in the ESEA address how teachers and school leaders should be evaluated. ", "The 112 th Congress continues to work on ESEA reauthorization. The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee has ordered reported an ESEA reauthorization bill that would incorporate some of the changes included in the ESEA flexibility package being offered by the Administration. The chairman of the House Education and Workforce Committee has released two draft ESEA reauthorization bills that would collectively provide for a comprehensive reauthorization of the ESEA. It is difficult to gauge at this stage in the process whether the 112 th Congress will pass a bill to reauthorize the ESEA, and whether Congress would include provisions similar to those of the ESEA flexibility package in a final bill. Most states have either applied for the ESEA flexibility package or have indicated an intention to do so. If those packages are approved by ED, they may be in effect in many states by the end of the current school year if ESEA reauthorization does not occur prior to that time. If the ESEA flexibility package is implemented by numerous states prior to reauthorization, it may complicate an eventual reauthorization, as the ESEA flexibility package may become the de facto ESEA law under which many states are operating. If Congress does not take this into account in its reauthorization process, states and LEAs may have to retool their accountability systems to comply with a new round of requirements from the federal government. Alternatively, states that have received the ESEA flexibility package could be permitted to continue to operate under waivers and principles similar to those included in the ESEA flexibility package, while other states could be required to comply with new ESEA requirements, thus creating two different systems of accountability under which states would be operating."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Applying for the ESEA Flexibility Package", "paragraphs": ["Following the announcement of the ESEA flexibility package, 39 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico indicated that they intended to apply for it.

Based on a review of the Federal Register documents announcing the waivers, only 5 of the 634 waivers granted specified any conditions to receive the waivers. In each of the five instances, however, the conditions specified were statutory requirements that the entity had to meet regardless of the receipt of the wavier.

"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legal Analysis", "paragraphs": ["As noted above, the Secretary may waive \"any statutory or regulatory requirement\" of the ESEA. The statute sets forth a waiver request process and specifies provisions that are not subject to waiver, but the waiver authority otherwise appears to be very broad. It is important to note, however, that ED's waiver authority is discretionary, not mandatory. This discretionary authority was upheld by a federal district court in a 2006 case in which the court rejected a state's challenge to ED's denial of its waiver request. According to the court, \"the language of the provision governing waivers grants the Secretary broad discretion to deny states' waiver requests.\"", "Less judicial guidance is available regarding the full reach of the Secretary's authority to grant statutory waivers. The starting point in interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself. The Supreme Court often recites the \"plain meaning rule,\" that, if the language of the statute is plain and unambiguous, it must be applied according to its terms. Based on the plain language of the statute, the scope of ED's waiver authority appears to be quite broad, suggesting that ED may indeed have the authority to waive the various requirements of the ESEA specified in its flexibility proposal. This interpretation is bolstered by the fact that, although the ESEA previously contained similar waiver authority, Congress expressly enacted the current waiver provisions as part of the No Child Left Behind Act amendments to the ESEA, signaling that Congress clearly understood and intended for ED to waive the requirements of that act when appropriate. However, this analysis does not end the inquiry, given that ED may face other legal challenges to its use of such authority, especially in light of the conditional nature of its waiver proposal.", "Thus far, there do not appear to have been legal challenges to ED's authority to waive statutory requirements under the ESEA. Because there are no federal court cases that provide guidance regarding the scope of the Secretary's waiver authority, it is useful to examine similar challenges involving the use of statutory waiver authority by other federal agencies to see if the courts have placed any limits on such authority. ", "In one prominent case, several environmental groups challenged the constitutionality of Section 102 of the REAL ID Act of 2005, which provides the Secretary of Homeland Security with \"the authority to waive all legal requirements\" he deems necessary for the expeditious construction of barriers along the Mexican border. Specifically, the plaintiffs argued that the waiver authority violates separation of powers principles because it was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the executive branch. In upholding the waiver provision, the federal district court noted that \"the Supreme Court has widely permitted the Congress to delegate its legislative authority to the other branches, so long as the delegation is accompanied by sufficient guidance.\" Waiver authorities under other federal statutes have withstood similar \"nondelegation doctrine\" challenges. In general, all that is required is that Congress provide an \"intelligible principle\" to guide the agency in exercising its delegated authority. This requirement appears to be satisfied by Section 9401, which requires waiver requests to describe, among other things, how the waiver will \"increase the quality of instruction for students\" and \"improve the academic achievement of students.\" Thus, it appears that ED's waiver authority would be likely to survive a constitutional challenge based on the nondelegation doctrine.", "Another example of statutory waiver authority occurs under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which permits the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to establish \"reasonable exemptions\" to the statute as the agency \"may find necessary and proper in the public interest.\" When the EEOC issued an exemption to permit the practice of coordinating employer-provided retiree health coverage with eligibility for Medicare, the regulation was challenged in court. Initially, a federal district court struck down the exemption, ruling that the EEOC's overly broad interpretation of its waiver authority had violated congressional intent and the plain language of the statute. Based on a subsequent Supreme Court decision regarding judicial deference to agency interpretations, the district court later reversed itself and upheld the EEOC's waiver. In affirming, the court of appeals held that the regulation did fall within the EEOC's waiver authority. According to the court, because \"the power to grant exemptions provides an agency with authority to permit certain actions at variance with the express provisions of the statute in question ... Congress made plain its intent to allow limited practices not otherwise permitted under the statute, so long as they are 'reasonable' and 'necessary and proper in the public interest.'\" As the initial district court ruling demonstrates, it is possible for a court to find grounds for invalidating an agency's exercise of its statutory waiver authority. However, the EEOC ultimately prevailed in court, suggesting that agencies such as ED may face few restrictions on the use of statutory waiver authority as long as they comply with the statutory requirements regarding the granting of such waivers.", "Also instructive are legal challenges to Section 1115 of the Social Security Act, which authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to waive compliance with certain statutory requirements when conducting demonstration or pilot programs that are likely to promote specified statutory objectives. In general, the courts have been unwilling to circumscribe the Secretary's authority to approve experimental projects under Section 1115 and have rejected challenges to such waivers on numerous occasions. However, judicial deference to the Secretary's broad authority is not without limits. Reviewing courts have cited the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) as affording judicial authority to invalidate waivers found to be \"arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" While the APA does not allow a court to substitute its judgment for that of the Secretary when making the deferential arbitrary and capricious inquiry, the court may find a waiver decision arbitrary and capricious where \"the agency has relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.\" Indeed, in one of the very few successful challenges to a Section 1115 waiver, the court held that the Secretary had violated both the APA and Section 1115 by granting a statutory waiver without conducting sufficient review or making adequate findings regarding the merits of the waiver.", "Taken together, the above cases indicate that, although individual waivers may face legal challenges and may even be struck down on occasion, the courts will generally uphold an agency's exercise of its statutory waiver authority so long as the agency develops an adequate record regarding its decision to grant a waiver and ensures that the waiver is granted consistent with the statutory purposes and procedures set forth in the section authorizing such waivers. As a result, it appears that ED does have the authority to waive ESEA statutory requirements related to issues such as academic standards and assessments; accountability requirements, including the timeline by which all students are to be proficient in reading/language arts and mathematics; school improvement, corrective action, and restructuring requirements; and public school choice and supplemental educational services, as long as ED develops the aforementioned adequate record and ensures that the waiver is granted consistent with the statutory purposes and procedures set forth in Section 9401. ", "It is important to note that the cases described above involve agency waivers that appear to be unconditional, while the waivers in ED's flexibility plan would be granted only on the condition that states meet multiple new standards established by the department. It is not uncommon for agencies to impose new conditions when they grant waivers, and several courts have upheld waivers that contain agency-imposed conditions. Moreover, such conditions may not necessarily be considered to be requirements, given that a state's compliance would be purely voluntary, and any state that did not want to submit to such conditions could simply forgo seeking a waiver on that basis or initiate a separate request for an unconditional waiver of the same requirements. However, the proposed ED waivers and corresponding conditions appear to be significantly broader in scope than previous waivers considered by the courts, a feature that may distinguish ED's flexibility plan from other conditional waivers that have survived legal challenge."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Overview of Waivers Included in the Administration's ESEA Flexibility Package", "paragraphs": ["As previously mentioned, on September 23, 2011, President Obama and the Secretary formally announced the availability of a package of 10 waivers and one optional waiver of ESEA requirements for states and the four principles that states must meet to obtain the waivers.

Under the first option, the state could set AMOs in annual equal increments to meet the goal of reducing by half the percentage of students in the all students group and in each of the subgroups who are not proficient within six years. The second option would be for a state to establish AMOs that increase in equal increments and result in 100% of students achieving proficiency no later than the end of the 2019-2020 school year. The third option would allow a state to set its AMOs based on an \"educationally sound rationale.\" The baseline for establishing the AMOs under the first two options would be the proficiency rates based on the 2010-2011 school year assessments.

Adoption and implementation of the standards and assessments is optional. Currently, 44 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the standards. It remains to be seen how many of these states will ultimately implement the standards and implement the standards as they were developed. In addition, 44 states and the District of Columbia have joined at least one of two groups currently working on developing common assessments for use by the 2014-2015 school year.

However, the movement clearly has the support of the Obama Administration. In its Blueprint for the reauthorization of the ESEA, the Administration proposes requiring states to adopt and implement common standards, presumably the aforementioned standards, or to have their standards vetted by a local university system. In addition, the Administration provided additional points to states competing for Race to the Top (RTTT) grants authorized by the ARRA if they adopted the common standards by a certain date. This incentive may have resulted in more states agreeing to adopt the standards than would have otherwise occurred. The requirement to adopt and implement standards that are common to a significant number of states (or alternatively adopting standards vetted by a state network of IHEs) in order to receive the ESEA flexibility package may help ensure that states that agreed to adopt the standards but did not win a RTTT grant will continue to move forward with implementation.

For example, states that adopt the common core standards are permitted to add additional standards of their own choosing to the common core standards. Thus, each state adopting and implementing the common core standards could continue to have a unique set of state standards that share common elements with other adopting states. As a result of the RTTT common assessment competition, there will be at least two different assessments linked to the common core standards. It is unclear how the common assessments would accommodate any additional standards that states choose to add to the common core standards. Presumably, if states added additional standards to the common core standards, they would also want to determine how well students are mastering those standards. In addition, it is possible that multiple states could choose to use the same assessments to measure student performance but select different levels of performance on the assessments as indicating proficiency (e.g., one state could say that students must get 75% of the questions correct on the common assessment to be considered proficient, while another state could set the bar at 50%).", "It is important to note that neither the common core standards movement nor the assessments movement is proposing a common curriculum. Decisions regarding how standards are taught to students and how students are prepared for assessments would remain a state and local decision.

The Blueprint further requires that these activities \"must be aligned with evidence of improvements in student learning \u2026 [and] aimed at improving the equitable distribution of effective teachers and principals.\"", "Under RTTT, subsection (D)(2) of the first round application asked states to describe the extent to which it has developed a plan and set annual targets to ensure that participating LEAs", "establish clear approaches to measuring individual student growth; design and implement \"rigorous, transparent, and fair evaluation systems for teachers and principals that (a) differentiate effectiveness using multiple rating categories that take into account data on student growth (as defined in this notice) as a significant factor, and (b) are designed and developed with teacher and principal involvement\"; conduct annual evaluations of teachers and principals that include the provision of timely and constructive feedback; and use the results of these evaluations for \"developing teachers and principals;\" making decisions regarding compensation, promotion, and retention of teachers and principals; determining whether to grant tenure or full certification to teachers and principals; or removing ineffective tenured and untenured teachers and principals after providing opportunities for improvement."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Discussion and Possible Issues", "paragraphs": ["The ESEA flexibility package requires that LEAs must implement the new teacher evaluation systems no later than the start of the 2013-2014 school year (or the start of the 2014-2015 school year if they choose to pilot them in 2013-2014). Although many states may be able to produce the teacher evaluation guidelines required by the ESEA flexibility package, it is not clear whether school districts would be able to meet the deadlines required for piloting and full implementation of new teacher evaluation systems. Recent reviews of state policy in this area suggest that several states have already established some of the required guidelines such as multiple performance levels, use of student growth data, multiple observations, and annual evaluations. Many states, however, have made some or all of these guidelines optional and it is not clear how many and to what extent school districts have adopted them. It may be difficult for some LEAs, particularly those with limited staff, to implement certain elements of the proposed evaluation system either by the pilot deadline or the full implementation deadline.", "The ESEA flexibility package requires that the new evaluation systems inform personnel decisions. However, perhaps the most important of these decisions, the granting of tenure, may occur too soon for evaluation information to have an impact. Tenure policies are governed at the state level. Most states (43) award tenure after three or fewer years of teaching and only four states require that \"evidence of student learning be the preponderant or decisive criterion in such decisions.\" If evaluation information were to be part of the tenure decision, some districts may only have one or two years of results to use in the tenure decision-making process. Thus, without tenure reform, it may not be practical to expect evaluation systems to inform tenure decisions. ", "States applying for the ESEA flexibility package are expected to ensure that districts implement evaluation systems in a high-quality manner by, among other steps, monitoring inter-rater reliability. This may be difficult in very small districts with few staff members (roughly one-third of all LEAs nationwide had fewer than 20 FTE teachers in 2009-2010). Such LEAs may have difficulty staffing enough evaluators to gauge inter-rater reliability. ", "The ESEA flexibility package retains the requirement, in ESEA Section 1111(b)(8)(C), that states ensure that poor and minority children are not taught at higher rates than other children by inexperienced, unqualified, or out-of-field teachers, while it removes the mechanisms in current law to enforce the HQT requirement. Although ED's latest HQT report reveals that nearly all (97%) core academic classes nationwide are staffed by HQTs, classes in high-poverty schools were less likely to be staffed by an HQT than were classes in low-poverty schools. At the elementary level, 98% of core academic classes in low-poverty schools were taught by HQTs compared to 97% of classes in high-poverty schools. The gap was greater at the secondary level, with 97% of classes in low-poverty schools taught by HQTs compared to 94% of classes in high-poverty schools.

Reducing Duplication and Unnecessary Burden", "paragraphs": ["Each SEA is required to provide an assurance that it will evaluate its reporting requirements and based on the findings from this evaluation, \"revise its own administrative requirements to reduce duplication and unnecessary burden on LEAs and schools.\" ED notes that in order to support schools and LEAs in focusing on achieving the best outcomes for students, SEAs should eliminate duplicative and burdensome reporting requirements that do not affect student outcomes. Under Title I-A, states are already required to provide the \"least restrictive and burdensome regulations\" for LEAs and schools receiving Title I-A funds. The Blueprint did not address this\u00a0issue.", "In the ESEA Eligibility FAQs, ED provides several example of actions SEAs might take to reduce burden. For example, an SEA might review its record keeping and reporting requirements to identify any duplicity. It might also identify ways to streamline data collection timelines, share similar information among programs and agencies, or identify barriers to the flexible use of funds. Once burdens or barriers are identified, a state could take regulatory or legislative action to address them. In making changes, however, ED cautions states to evaluate changes by \"considering their impact on student outcomes and in particular the outcomes of its neediest students.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Implementation Timeline", "paragraphs": ["As previously discussed, the ESEA flexibility package would apply to school years 2011-2012, 2012-2013, and 2013-2014. States would have the option to apply for a one-year waiver extension for the 2014-2015 school year. ED has established a detailed timeline for the implementation of the waivers by states, indicating what states must provide when they submit their applications and what must be accomplished during each year of the waiver. One interesting aspect of the timeline is that if states do not apply for the optional one-year extension, they may not have to actually implement various requirements associated with the conditions for receiving waivers. For example, during the 2013-2014 school year, states are required to pilot the implementation of teacher and principal evaluation and support systems. Full implementation is not required until the 2014-2015 school year. If Congress has not acted to reauthorize the ESEA by the end of the 2013-2014 school year, it appears that states that do not apply for the one-year waiver extension may then have to revert to compliance with current law requirements. Also, the Secretary retains the authority under ESEA Section 9401 to terminate the waivers if SEAs or LEAs fail to comply with the requirements associated with the waivers.", "ED has noted that the implementation timeline specifies both a timeline for implementing the principle associated with the waivers as well as the waivers themselves. The deadlines for meeting a particular principle are the latest dates by which an SEA or LEA may meet a principle and still be in compliance with the requirements established for receiving the ESEA flexibility package. The dates specified for implementing a particular waiver are the earliest time that an SEA or LEA may take advantage of a particular waiver. An SEA can choose not to implement a particular waiver, provided it continues to carry out current law in that area.
