Maryland , 442 U.S. 735 (1979), in a pen register case, has held that there is no Fourth Amendment protected reasonable expectation of privacy in records of telephone calls held in the hands of third party providers, where the content of any call is not intercepted. The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees:", "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.", "Whether the use of a pen register is a \"search and seizure\" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment determines if the government, in compliance with the Constitution, must secure a warrant or court order prior to its installation. In 1979, the United States Supreme Court decided this question in Smith v. Maryland, holding that the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the use of pen registers without a warrant. Writing the majority opinion joined by four other justices, Justice Harry Blackmun drew a distinction between the acquisition of contents of telephone communications using electronic listening devices, which the Court in Katz v. United States had deemed to be a \"search\" under the Fourth Amendment, and the capture of electronic impulses that identify the numbers dialed on a telephone using a pen register device. According to the majority in Smith , it is a constitutionally significant difference that pen registers do not record the contents of communications, in contrast to the listening devices employed in Katz . The Court explained that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to the use of pen registers because individuals do not have a legitimate expectation of privacy against invasion by government action, that protects the numbers dialed into a telephone system:", "All telephone users realize that they must \"convey\" phone numbers to the telephone company, since it is through telephone company switching equipment that their calls are completed. All subscribers realize, moreover, that the phone company has facilities for making permanent records of the numbers they dial, for they see a list of their long-distance (toll) calls on their monthly bills. In fact, pen registers and similar devices are routinely used by telephone companies \"for the purposes of checking billing operations, detecting fraud, and preventing violations of law.\"", "The Court stated that telephone customers, by voluntarily conveying phone numbers to the telephone company and \"expos[ing] that information to its equipment in the ordinary course of business,\" assume the risk that the company may disclose such information to law enforcement. Because there is no actual or legitimate expectation of privacy in the numbers dialed from a telephone, the installation and use of a pen register is not a \"search\" requiring a warrant under the Fourth Amendment, the Court ruled.", "In contrast, the dissenting opinions in Smith concluded that telephone numbers dialed from a phone are entitled to the same constitutional protection that telephone conversations receive under Katz because such numbers are not without \"content\" - they \"reveal the identities of the persons and the places called, and thus reveal the most intimate details of a person's life.\" Furthermore, the dissenters objected to the majority's characterization that the use of a telephone involves an assumption of risk on the part of the customer that telephone dialing information might be disclosed to the government; assumption of risk generally requires there to have been a choice to engage in the activity, and \"as a practical matter, individuals have no realistic alternative\" to the use of a telephone.", "Although the protections of the Fourth Amendment may not reach records of telephone calls held by third parties, Congress has enacted a number of statutes since the Smith decision that both permit access by the government for foreign intelligence or law enforcement purposes to information relating to telephone numbers dialed from or received by a particular telephone number, as well as duration and usage, while simultaneously imposing limitations as to how such information may be accessed and under what circumstances it may be used."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Statutory Provisions", "paragraphs": ["Information regarding telephone calling patterns, duration, usage, and length of service may be sought by the government directly through the use of pen registers or trap and trace devices.

When the FCC implemented Section 222, telecommunications carriers were required to obtain express consent from their customers (i.e., \"opt-in consent\") before a carrier could use customer phone records to market services outside of the customer's relationship with the carrier. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit struck down those rules, finding that they violated the First and Fifth Amendments of the Constitution.", "Subsequently, the FCC amended its CPNI regulations to require telecommunications carriers to receive opt-in (affirmative) consent before disclosing CPNI to third parties or affiliates that do not provide communications-related services. However, carriers are permitted to disclose CPNI to affiliated parties after obtaining a customer's \"opt-out\" consent. \"Opt-Out\" consent means that the telephone company sends the customer a notice saying it will consider the customer to have given approval to use the customer's information for marketing unless the customer tells it not to do so (usually within 30 days.) Carriers are required, prior to soliciting the customer's approval, to provide notice to the customer of the customer's right to restrict use, disclosure, and access to the customer's CPNI. Carriers are also required to establish safeguards to protect against the unauthorized disclosure of CPNI, including requirements that carriers maintain records that track access to customer CPNI records. Each carrier is also required to certify annually its compliance with the CPNI requirements and to make this certification publicly available. The FCC recently proposed $100,000 fines on telephone companies with inadequate certifications regarding compliance with FCC rules protecting customer information from disclosure. A suit challenging the opt-in requirement is currently pending before the D.C. Circuit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Penalties", "paragraphs": ["Carriers in violation of the CPNI requirements are subject to a variety of penalties under the act. Under the criminal penalty provision in Section 501 of the act, 47 U.S.C. Section 501, any person who willfully and knowingly does, causes or allows to be done, any act, matter, or thing prohibited by the act or declared unlawful, or who willfully and knowingly omits or fails to do what is required by the act, or who willfully or knowingly causes or allows such omission or failure, shall be punished for any such offense for which no penalty (other than a forfeiture) is provided by the act by a fine up to $10,000, imprisonment up to one year, or both, and in the case of a person previously convicted of violating the act, a fine up to $10,000, imprisonment up to two years, or both.", "Section 502 of the act, 47 U.S.C. Section 502, punishes willful and knowing violations of Federal Communication Commission regulations. Any person who willfully and knowingly violates any rule, regulation, restriction, or condition made or imposed by the Commission is, in addition to other penalties provided by law, subject to a maximum fine of $500 for each day on which a violation occurs.", "Under Section 503(b)(1) of the act, 47 U.S.C. Section 503(b)(1), any person who is determined by the Commission to have willfully or repeatedly failed to comply with any provision of the act or any rule, regulation, or order issued by the Commission shall be liable to the United States for a civil money \"forfeiture\" penalty. Section 312(f)(1) of the act, 47 U.S.C. Section 312(f)(1), defines \"willful\" as \"the conscious and deliberate commission or omission of [any] act, irrespective of any intent to violate\" the law. \"Repeated\" means that the act was committed or omitted more than once, or lasts more than one day. If the violator is a common carrier, Section 503(b) authorizes the Commission to assess a forfeiture penalty of up to $130,000 for each violation or for each day of a continuing violation, except that the amount assessed for any continuing violation shall not exceed a total of $1,325,000 for any single act or failure to act. To impose such a forfeiture penalty, the Commission must issue a notice of apparent liability, and the person against whom the notice has been issued must have an opportunity to show, in writing, why no such forfeiture penalty should be imposed. The Commission will then issue a forfeiture if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the person has violated the act or a Commission rule."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
