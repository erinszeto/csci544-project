Some argue that the USSC's staff should be increased and that movement restrictions on U.S. members of the USSC staff should be lifted. Some maintain that the U.S. mandate in security assistance matters should be expanded to give the USSC across-the-board authority to train and outfit PA security organizations, including for counterterrorism operations, and perhaps also to give INL an enhanced role in criminal justice sector reform. Others support a more modest U.S. \"footprint\" in the region, or question the advisability of U.S. security assistance altogether\u2014preferring either to have the PA depend on itself or third parties for assistance or to transfer primary security responsibility in the West Bank to an international peacekeeping force."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Since shortly after the establishment of limited Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the mid-1990s, the United States has periodically provided assistance to the Palestinian Authority (PA) for civil security and counterterrorism purposes.

These obligations are predicated on the understanding that security is a core issue upon which Israeli-Palestinian peace depends. Previous Israeli-Palestinian efforts at security cooperation collapsed during the second Palestinian intifada (also known as the Al Aqsa intifada , or \"uprising\") that took place earlier this decade. ", "Since Hamas gained control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007, Lieutenant General Keith Dayton, head of the USSC since December 2005, has provided guidance to the Jordanian Public Security Directorate (JPSD) and international contractors in connection with their U.S.-funded \"gendarmerie-style\" training of West Bank-based PA security personnel. The funding has come through the State Department's INCLE account, managed by the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (\"INL Bureau\" or \"INL\"), which coordinates with the USSC. As of January 2010, approximately 400 Presidential Guardsmen and 2,200 National Security Forces (NSF) troops (comprising four NSF battalions) have been trained at the Jordan International Police Training Center (JIPTC) near Amman (see \" U.S. Training Assistance to PA Forces \" below). Dayton envisions that a total of ten 500-man NSF battalions will eventually be trained for the West Bank, and USSC/INL seeks funding from the 111 th Congress to that end. See Figure 1 above for a map of West Bank governorates and of zones of PA security responsibility (so-called \"Area A\" under the Oslo agreements of the mid-1990s).

Yet questions regarding the USSC mission persist. Might the PA forces establish a sustained pattern of success in countering and dismantling militant and terrorist networks, despite the facts that the United States may only supply non-lethal equipment to PA forces and that U.S.-sponsored training in Jordan has not concentrated heavily on counterterrorism techniques? Some Palestinians and outside observers assert that the effectiveness and credibility of PA operations are undermined by Israeli restrictions\u2014including curfews, checkpoints, no-go zones, and limitations on international arms and equipment transfers\u2014as well as by Israel's own security operations in the West Bank and its control over land, air, and sea access to Gaza. Israel claims that its continuing operations in the West Bank are necessary in order to reduce the threat of terrorism emanating from the territory. These operations underscore the fact that the Israeli-Palestinian agreements that authorized the creation of Palestinian security forces in the 1990s in areas of limited Palestinian self-rule contained clauses that preserve Israel's prerogative to conduct operations in those same areas for purposes of its own security.", "Additionally, how might short-term operational success translate into permanent consolidation of competent, defactionalized civilian control over the PA forces and the broader criminal justice sector? Can this occur in a complex political environment featuring (1) the continuing presence of Israeli occupying forces and settlers; (2) other overt and/or possible covert assistance from, among others, Arab and other Muslim-majority states, Russia, the United States, and Europe; (3) possibly competing goals of (a) convincing the Palestinian populace to view\u2014and unify around\u2014PA forces as legitimate, nonpartisan protectors and as a potential bellwether of statehood and (b) thwarting terrorist/militia activity against Israel; and (4) historical obstacles posed by institutional inertia, Palestinian factionalism, and region-wide political trends?

It is unclear to what extent similarities and differences between the Palestinian context and these other situations are likely to influence outcomes. It is also unclear how U.S. security assistance to the PA might lead to overall progress on (1) the Israeli-Palestinian political track (including Israel's willingness to halt settlement building in the West Bank and East Jerusalem and to contemplate West Bank redeployments in connection with final-status negotiations), (2) Palestinian civil society, governance, and economic development, and (3) efforts to end geographical and factional divisions between Palestinians in the West Bank and in Gaza."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background and Overview", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Oslo-Era Security Assistance", "paragraphs": ["U.S. security assistance to the Palestinian Authority was first provided after the Oslo agreements of the mid-1990s between Israel and Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) allowed for the establishment of Palestinian internal security forces in the Gaza Strip and parts of the West Bank as part of the plan for limited Palestinian self-rule in the two Israeli-occupied territories. Concerns existed from the forces' inception over potential threats to Israel's security from the blurring of the line between the new PA forces' policing functions and their potential for military use\u2014as the forces were largely drawn from the PLO's Palestinian Liberation Army and from Arafat's personal security detail. Additionally, Arafat approved the establishment of several security and/or intelligence organizations personally accountable to him that were not officially mandated under Oslo agreements, such as the Preventive Security Organization (PSO). Israeli leaders tolerated the creation of these organizations partly because they believed that their less formal nature might give Arafat a freer hand to neutralize terrorist activity by Palestinian groups that rejected the Oslo peace process. ", "Partly as a result of these concerns, the United States allowed other international actors\u2014particularly Jordan, Egypt, Japan, the European Union and individual European states\u2014to take leading roles in providing the forces' training and funding. Until 1996, the United States provided the PA little more than approximately $5 million for police salaries and some non-lethal equipment (mainly trucks and boots from military surplus stocks), although it did maintain influence over the international security assistance effort through various mechanisms that were established to coordinate donor activities. ", "U.S. involvement reportedly increased in March 1996 as political pressure to foster Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation rose following several terrorist attacks by Hamas in Israel. Likely determining that the organizations with personal ties to Arafat and patronage networks were more relevant than the official police, the Clinton Administration reportedly began providing these organizations with tens of millions of dollars in covert assistance to \"increase the professionalism of the Palestinian security services and help combat terrorism,\" according to the New York Times . The European Union also reportedly began a counterterrorism program. According to Norwegian analyst Brynjar Lia, the United States and other donors generally bypassed PA and international mechanisms that had been established to coordinate security assistance, instead dealing directly with their preferred organizations. By fostering a fiefdom mentality among competing security chiefs to address short-term objectives, these donors might have undermined their own calls for a more consolidated PA security sector answerable to civilian control and the rule of law.", "U.S. and European security assistance programs continued despite the Hasmonean/Western Wall Tunnel riots in September 1996, which featured fatal clashes between Palestinian police and Israeli soldiers in and around Jerusalem. The role of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in mentoring leaders from the Preventive Security Organization and helping coordinate Israeli-Palestinian security activities was reportedly formalized (although the CIA was not mentioned by name) in the October 1998 Wye River Memorandum.

During the intifada, some members of Palestinian security forces engaged in activities aimed at Israeli soldiers and, in some cases, civilians. Palestinians generally characterized these actions as \"resistance,\" but most Israelis perceived them to be acts of militancy and/or terrorism. Some beneficiaries of U.S. aid were alleged to have been involved in or to have acquiesced to the violence. Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation essentially ceased, despite U.S. efforts to revive it as a means of reducing or halting violence through proposals such as the Sharm al Sheikh Fact-Finding Committee Report (also known as the \"Mitchell Report\") of April 2001, the \"Tenet Work Plan\" and the \"Zinni Paper\" of March 2002, and the Roadmap (which was introduced by the international Quartet\u2014the United States, United Nations, European Union, and Russia\u2014in 2002 and formalized in 2003). Also, much of the PA security forces' infrastructure was destroyed by Israel. Covert U.S. counterterrorism assistance programs to the Preventive Security Organization reportedly continued during the intifada, and reports suggest that they probably remain in existence. ", "Following Arafat's death in 2004 and Mahmoud Abbas's election to succeed him as PA president in 2005, the Bush Administration believed that an opportunity had arrived to achieve progress on Palestinian security reform. To that end, the United States created the office of the U.S. Security Coordinator within the State Department and appointed Lieutenant General William (\"Kip\") Ward as its first commander. While waiting for funding to arrive, Ward\u2014and Dayton when he succeeded Ward in December 2005\u2014consulted with Israeli and Palestinian authorities in connection with the PA's assumption of responsibility for security in the Gaza Strip following Israel's August 2005 withdrawal.", "Plans for the USSC were hampered by the victory of Hamas in 2006 Palestinian Legislative Council elections and the establishment of a Hamas-led government from March 2006 to June 2007. The USSC advised and helped train Presidential Guardsmen loyal to President Abbas during that time\u2014including with respect to border duties and ultimately unsuccessful efforts to stave off Hamas attacks at Gaza's Karni crossing\u2014but, with no budget, the USSC's capabilities were severely limited.

Since then\u2014with approximately $395 million in U.S. funds reprogrammed or appropriated to INL through the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) account (see Table 1 below for a detailed breakdown)\u2014there has been a rapid expansion in security assistance to the Palestinians to support the PA's Security Sector Reform and Transformation program (part of the 2008-2010 Palestinian Reform and Development Plan that is meant to help the PA meet its Roadmap obligations), particularly for the Ministry of Interior (MoI), the Presidential Guard (PG), and the National Security Forces.

", "U.S. security assistance efforts in the West Bank take place in a context featuring continuing Israeli occupation; Palestinian factional conflict and geographical separation (between the West Bank and Hamas-controlled Gaza); extensive overlap and redundancy among different PA security organizations; a historical lack of centralization; and the provision of security assistance by other international actors, such as the European Union (EU), Russia, and various Muslim-majority countries. The EU is particularly involved with reform and train-and-equip efforts with the Palestinian Civil Police (PCP) and in the criminal justice sector through the EU Police Co-ordinating Office for Palestinian Police Support (EUPOL COPPS) program headquartered in Ramallah (see \" Deployment of U.S.-Sponsored, JIPTC-Trained PA Forces \" and \" Criminal Justice Sector Reform \" below). EUPOL COPPS has indicated to CRS that individual EU member states, plus Norway and Canada, have contributed $47 million to EUPOL COPPS since June 2008 for specific projects aimed at strengthening and reforming the PCP and the PA criminal justice sector.", "Due to the involvement of many other actors and the interplay of several variables, judging the impact of U.S. efforts may be difficult. For example, the push since 2007 to heighten West Bank security may have been aided by Hamas's decision to concentrate resources on consolidating its rule in Gaza, as well as by heightened determination on the part of PA leaders such as President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad to improve West Bank security in the wake of Hamas's Gaza takeover. It may also have been helped by other militants' calculation that they had more to gain at the time by laying their weapons aside, particularly in light of their weariness following several years of the second intifada and intensified Israeli security operations in the West Bank. ", "Despite the inability of Israel and the PLO thus far to reach a final-status agreement, U.S. security assistance efforts of the past two years appear to have yielded some favorable results, both in establishing law and order among West Bank populations and in countering terrorism. Still, it is uncertain what lasting value the tactical successes claimed might deliver to the Palestinian people. There is political support for the continuation of USSC/INL's efforts, although it is possible that the consensus among the United States, Israel, and the PA to continue the USSC/INL mission is intended by each party to advance a political agenda different from the others'. ", "During the spring and summer of 2009, tensions between the USSC and the PA (particularly between Dayton and Fayyad) reportedly emerged, partly as a result of public remarks Dayton made in May about the success of PA crowd control measures in the West Bank during the December 2008-January 2009 Gaza conflict (the quote is included below\u2014see \" During the Gaza Conflict \"). The PA believed that these remarks might lead Palestinians to conclude that the PA was indirectly helping the Israelis prosecute the conflict. There were also reports that some might interpret as showing that the PA was concerned about maintaining effective and ultimate control (as well as maintaining the perception that it, and not any outside\u2014particularly U.S.\u2014authority, maintains control) over its internal affairs and the chain of command involving its various security organizations and regional units. Thus, Dayton's direct and informal contacts with PA commanders throughout the West Bank were reportedly reduced in favor of more formalized and centralized communications with PA Ministry of Interior and security officials. The USSC also lowered its public profile over the last half of 2009. ", "Yet, at the beginning of 2010, a senior Western official based in the region told CRS that the working relationship between the USSC and the PA remained intact and that INCLE security and criminal justice sector assistance programs continue and have been expanded with PA support. Integrating the USSC/INL mission's efforts with the overall political effort to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the responsibility of Special Envoy George Mitchell and his staff, with assistance from the State Department's Bureau of Near East Affairs.

At the same time, the United States will be challenged to persuade the Israelis that permitting increased freedom and exclusivity of operation for the PA forces will not compromise Israeli security. Despite the successes claimed, the extent to which U.S. efforts have contributed to the PA's competencies (which remain disputed) to establish the rule of law and to permanently and comprehensively neutralize and dismantle militant and terror networks remains unclear. Some believe that much of the success thus far could be largely attributable to factors other than the efforts of the USSC/INL and EUPOL COPPS programs. These factors could include the willingness of PA Prime Minister Salam Fayyad and PA President Mahmoud Abbas to deploy security forces more assertively in the West Bank in the wake of the 2007 Hamas takeover of Gaza. They could also include security operations by the intelligence organizations within the PA security structure\u2014the PSO and the General Intelligence Service (GIS, also known as the Mukhabarat). The PSO and the GIS do not participate in USSC-overseen training from INCLE funds\u2014except in Senior Leaders courses (see \" Substance of Training \" below)\u2014and are criticized for alleged human rights violations for their treatment of prisoners and interrogation methods. Another major factor that might account for security successes in the West Bank thus far is operational and intelligence support from Israel. ", "Some are concerned that it is hard to discern whether the PA forces' targeting of Hamas members is better characterized as a professional security effort by a nascent state-building institution to rein in militants who operate outside of the law, or as a means of political leverage for PA President Abbas and his associates against factional opponents such as Hamas. According to reported figures from the Independent Commission for Human Rights, an ombudsman organization for the PA, over 400 people arrested \"primarily for reasons of political affiliation\" were in detention in the West Bank as of May 31, 2009. Some analysts have asserted that the process of PA security reform being led by Prime Minister Fayyad is at least partly aimed at neutralizing Fatah (Abbas's political movement and Hamas's main rival) partisans within and/or outside of the security forces. This could be a helpful development if it is seen primarily as a move toward greater defactionalization, but could exacerbate infighting within the security forces and government if efforts to reduce Fatah's profile are seen as driven by personal political agendas. In this light, it is unclear whether the May 2009 replacement of PA Interior Minister (the cabinet minister with direct responsibility for security matters) Gen. Abdel Razeq al Yahya with Abbas loyalist and experienced bureaucrat Said Abu Ali in the new Fayyad-led PA government might be more accurately characterized either as progression toward greater civilian control or as sliding back toward greater factionalism (replacing a relatively apolitical minister with a partisan from Fatah). ", "There also are obstacles and challenges to comprehensive reform and consolidation of the security organizations (i.e., corruption, personal loyalty and patronage networks, potential infiltration by militants ), and outstanding concerns over translating short-term success with security into political progress in negotiating with Israel for peace and a Palestinian state. For example, some believe that U.S.-sponsored PA security reform is a necessary precondition for bringing about a Palestinian state at peace with Israel, but also believe that a Palestinian consensus or unity government including Hamas\u2014which could potentially reunite the West Bank and Gaza under credible, unified leadership\u2014is necessary. The pursuit of either of these goals could make the other one less likely to achieve, largely because of the sensitivity of addressing the question of how Hamas's militia and security forces for Gaza might coexist with or be integrated into the PA security forces. ", "Some observers might say that the PA forces' task is too formidable\u2014with or without security assistance from the United States or other international donors. These observers' skepticism about continued U.S. security assistance might stem from their perception of the limitations, restrictions, conditions, and disadvantages the forces face under continued Israeli occupation; or from a concern that security assistance to the PA might contribute to future violence\u2014either among Palestinian factions or between Israelis and Palestinians. They may prefer either to have the PA depend on itself or third parties for assistance or to transfer primary security responsibility in the West Bank to an international peacekeeping force."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "PA Security Organizations", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["Currently, there are five separate organizations that constitute the Palestinian Authority Security Forces (PASF): the National Security Forces (which includes an autonomous military intelligence branch), the Palestinian Civil Police, the Preventive Security Organization, the Presidential Guard, and the General Intelligence Service (see Figure 2 below).

An October 2009 statement by the NSF commander, Major General Diab al Ali (also known as \"Abu Fatah\"), indicates that the PA president retains ultimate control over the NSF and other PASF branches: \"The [NSF] coordinates with the Interior Ministry but falls under the command of Palestinian President Abu Mazen [Mahmoud Abbas], supreme commander of our security forces.\" Therefore, solidifying fully integral command and control within the MoI is an aspiration that has not been fully realized.

There is also the question of whether 5,000 new NSF troops are likely to be in harmony with the concept of a \"demilitarized Palestinian state\" presented by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his June 2009 speech at Bar-Ilan University in Tel Aviv. As mentioned above, some Palestinians, including PASF commanders, may view the NSF as more of a \"proto-army\" than as law-and-order gendarmes, despite the fact that the United States provides only non-lethal equipment and Israel only allows PA forces to possess \"light arms.\" Continued ambiguity regarding the true nature of the NSF could be problematic for its future coordination with Israeli counterparts, for its stance vis-\u00e0-vis Hamas-controlled forces in Gaza, and for its simultaneous amenability to (1) reform under accountable, defactionalized civilian control and (2) progression in counterterrorism capabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Trainee Recruitment and Vetting", "paragraphs": ["In early 2008, the PA instituted a financially attractive early retirement scheme meant to sift out less-motivated and undesirable officers and to free up places for new recruits for the PG, the NSF, and the police.

Others believe that coordination has been set back since Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's government came to power, claiming that the IDF is less willing to allow PASF personnel to operate in proximity to its troops in urban areas than it was under former prime minister Ehud Olmert. Some might conclude that waiting for an increased Israeli comfort level is unacceptable because of political reasons or because of the possibility that another crisis might scuttle existing prospects in the meantime. ", "A reason for skepticism is the so-called \"chicken-egg\" security dilemma\u2014that Israel might not leave the West Bank to the PASF until they have the capacity and willingness to suppress attacks on Israel, but that the PA forces cannot develop the necessary capacity and willingness while Israeli occupation forces stir Palestinian resentment and undermine the PA forces' ability to take independent action. The IDF routinely restricts the scope of PASF operations\u2014through curfews (as mentioned above), checkpoints, and limitations on international arms and equipment transfers\u2014and by refusing to make arrests requested by the PA in areas under Israeli control. Moreover, the effectiveness of the IDF in apprehending terror suspects reinforces a common Israeli belief that handing over control of anti-terror operations to the PA is not worth the risk of having such operations fail. Many PASF personnel feel, however, that IDF operations undermine Palestinians' willingness to perceive PA forces as their legitimate, independent protectors and as foundational building blocks for a future state. In such a context, can any amount of training, strategic advice, and coordination instill public confidence in the PA forces' efforts against militant networks?"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Counterterrorism and Consolidation: Comprehensiveness of USSC Role", "paragraphs": ["Before Israelis will agree to IDF withdrawal (partial or full) from the West Bank, a final peace agreement, and the creation of a Palestinian state, they may need to be convinced that the PA forces are capable of suppressing and dismantling terrorist infrastructures designed to stage attacks against Israel\u2014not least, against Jewish settlements in the West Bank (which necessitate much of the IDF presence there). It is uncertain whether PA forces, particularly JIPTC-trained NSF and PG forces, currently have this capability or are likely to acquire it soon. Training at JIPTC focuses more on establishing law and order than on counterterrorism techniques. It may be too early to tell whether recent PASF operations against Hamas militants (such as in Hebron and Qalqilya) are indications of general progress on the counterterrorism front\u2014in terms of (1) the PA's competence, (2) the Israelis' willingness to step aside, and (3) the impact on militant groups' hierarchies, weapons caches, and supply chains. ", "Some might say that if success in building the PA's counterterrorism capacity within a consolidated security structure subject to civilian control is the key to enabling progress in political negotiations with Israel, then the United States might consider giving the USSC\u2014the mission that is publicly tasked with helping effect PA security reforms\u2014broader authority over U.S. efforts with PASF organizations across the board. Neither the Preventive Security Organization, which reportedly received U.S. training in counterterrorism during the Arafat era and may still receive such training (as discussed above\u2014see \" Oslo-Era Security Assistance \" and \" Backslides and Delays in Reform: 2000-2007 \"), nor the General Intelligence Service currently falls under the USSC's train-and-equip mandate (with the exception of a few senior leaders from both organizations\u2014see \" Substance of Training \" above). By limiting the USSC's involvement with these PA intelligence organizations, the risk exists that allowing exceptions to the security reform mission could eventually\u2014through these organizations' lack of accountability\u2014undo and reverse whatever successes might be achieved. According to Yezid Sayigh, a longtime analyst of Palestinian security forces,", "the Palestinian public increasingly blames [Dayton] and the National Security Forces he is rebuilding for the human rights abuses and growing atmosphere of political intimidation generated by the intelligence agencies. Yet relations with the intelligence agencies are handled exclusively by the CIA and he is not privy to them. This only underlines the continuing lack of harmonization in the U.S. approach, and explains the conviction among Dayton's Palestinian counterparts that it is the U.S. Consulate and the CIA, not he, who lead on U.S. policy and keep the money flowing.", "One objection to involving the USSC directly with the PA intelligence organizations is that the U.S. could bring upon itself the appearance of impropriety by drawing closer in its ties to groups with questionable human rights records. On the other hand, one might counter, if the goal of PA security reform and consolidation is as important as its proponents say it is, then avoiding perceptions of impropriety might be less of a priority than working to help the PSO and/or the GIS rectify concerns they face on accountability and human rights issues, particularly given that U.S. ties to these organizations may already exist. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Historical Analogies and the Question of Political Progress", "paragraphs": ["It is virtually impossible to avoid drawing analogies between current U.S. security assistance efforts and efforts made during the Arafat era. Those who believe that matters are fundamentally different this time point to the fact that the PA is recruiting new, thoroughly vetted troops for its U.S.-sponsored NSF battalions, as opposed to recycled militiamen with checkered pasts. They also point to the fact that a U.S. three-star general (Dayton) has been personally based in the region for four years, lending his efforts and prestige to the mission, and that the four-month training program at JIPTC provides advantages to PA security personnel that Arafat-era personnel never had (see \" Substance of Training \" above). Yet, some observers question whether the improvements are sufficiently decisive. It is possible that undisciplined elements in the PA security forces, provocations from Israel, and/or demoralizing economic or political developments could contribute to one or more incidents that fan the flames of conflict, even though the forces' discipline has held thus far.", "There are those who are skeptical that the differences cited above are sufficient to ensure a better outcome. They point to similarities between the two time periods, as well as to other differences that might actually make the U.S.'s job more difficult than it was during the Arafat era. Even though there are fewer extant PA security organizations, complete consolidation under civilian control remains more of an aspiration than a fact, and the \"competing fiefdoms\" mentality continues. Much of the international assistance provided still bypasses the Ministry of Interior (although that is not the case with the USSC/INL program or EUPOL COPPS, which coordinate with the MoI) and is routed directly to the separate security organizations \u2014likely including the less transparent intelligence organizations. Can the United States and other Western donors help the PA counter the institutional inertia that they appear to have helped create?", "Skeptics also might note that the positive characterizations of PA security efforts by Israeli officials in recent months bear resemblance to similar statements of praise made during the Arafat era in the two years following the 1998 Wye River Memorandum. In both cases, U.S. efforts at brokering Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation have been tied to hopes that the United States could facilitate progress between Israel and the PLO on final-status peace negotiations at the same time. These hopes were frustrated in the Arafat era when the two sides failed to reach an agreement at Camp David in July 2000, and the collapse in security cooperation began soon after with the outbreak of the second intifada in September 2000. Might comparable damage be done to Israeli-PA security cooperation in the event significant political progress toward a two-state solution cannot be achieved under the auspices of the Obama Administration? If that might be the case, what is the risk that members of the PA forces might use their training and equipment against Israel\u2014either with or without provocation\u2014despite the steps being taken to avoid such an eventuality? Might motivating young PA security recruits through talk of a state raise the risk of negative unintended consequences by inflating expectations more than they are merited by socioeconomic and political developments?", "The prospects of reaching a successful political resolution might even be more difficult in the current situation because of Hamas's control over Gaza and the questions of legitimacy and political motivation that hang over Abbas, Fayyad, and the PASF's operations. Arafat faced no comparable factional challenge to his leadership of the Palestinian people. ", "Between the collapse of Arafat-era security efforts and now, lessons from intervening U.S. military operations and training missions in Iraq and Afghanistan have led several military officers and political actors\u2014from the Iraq Study Group and commanding generals such as David Petraeus to several Members of Congress and members of the Bush and Obama administrations\u2014to conclude that tactical successes in the security sphere can only be made permanent if reinforced by economic and political progress that draws support away from violent extremist groups such as Al Qaeda and the Taliban. Might the same logic apply to this situation\u2014linking the ultimate success of PA security reform to progress on economic development and on outstanding disputes with Israel, in hopes of drawing support away from Hamas and other militant groups? In a May 2009 interview with New York Jewish Week , Dayton himself acknowledged, \"Security by itself won't result in a Palestinian state,\" noting political and economic dimensions to the issue. \"But security is an important first step.\" Additionally, in March 2009, the National Journal quoted a \"senior U.S. officer knowledgeable about the West Bank operations\" as follows:", "What we've learned in counterinsurgency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan is that you have to follow up that security piece with economic development that promotes jobs, and restores personal pride, dignity, and hope to local citizens so that they turn away from radicalism and violence. The Israelis just don't think in those terms, which is one reason they haven't stopped settlement activities. Until they do that, Israel will continue to undermine the credibility of the more professional Palestinian security forces we're trying to create, by making it seem that they are only doing the bidding of Israel and the settlers.", "Another factor to consider is that the Palestinian rocket threat that has materialized since the second intifada may have made satisfying Israeli expectations on security more difficult than it would have been during the Arafat era. A December 2008 report by three U.S. defense policy experts that was published by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy said that Israel might be reluctant to withdraw from the West Bank unless it can reasonably guarantee that rocket attacks will not threaten Israel from there as they do from Gaza."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Options for Congress", "paragraphs": ["The 111 th Congress, through its capacities to provide oversight and to authorize and appropriate funds, has the opportunity to monitor the statements and activities of the Obama Administration (including U.S. Special Envoy for Middle East Peace George Mitchell) closely and to fulfill its constitutionally distinct but co-equal role on this subject. Yet, Congress might also consider to what extent it is advisable to involve itself in the details of security assistance efforts, and to what extent it is advisable to accord deference to those who are tasked with the efforts on a day-to-day basis. There also could be calls for Congress to take into account how U.S. security assistance might lead to progress on (1) the Israeli-Palestinian political track (including Israel's willingness to halt settlement building in the West Bank and East Jerusalem and to contemplate redeployment from the West Bank in connection with final-status negotiations), (2) Palestinian civil society, governance, and economic development, and (3) efforts to end geographical and factional divisions between Palestinians in the West Bank and in Gaza.

Another is whether U.S. involvement in strengthening and reforming PA security forces is feeding a perception that the PA forces are more \"Israel's cops\" than focused on state-building from a Palestinian perspective. Opponents of an emphasis on PA security reform and on measures promoting incremental progress in civil society, governance, and economic development at the expense of a more expeditious political resolution with Israel might argue that efforts to bolster Palestinian moderates in the 16-plus years since Oslo have appeared to make Hamas stronger, not weaker. (Yet, Hamas is also politically vulnerable to charges that it is the proxy of an external power\u2014in its case, Iran.) In the final calculus, some believe that these possible political liabilities, when considered together with doubts that U.S. assistance can enable the PA to overcome the challenges and obstacles it faces on security matters\u2014including the difficulties posed by Israeli occupation\u2014militate against continued assistance. Others might argue against continued assistance out of concerns that it could contribute to future intra-Palestinian or Israeli-Palestinian violence. At minimum, periodic reevaluations might be advisable with regard to the cost-efficiency and effectiveness of (1) venues for and types of training, (2) methods and types used in furnishing equipment and constructing facilities, and (3) provision of strategic and tactical assistance.", "Yet another concern is the possibility that U.S. security assistance efforts might be publicized by either or both the Israelis and/or the Palestinians to fit a political narrative that may not be in U.S. interests of promoting a lasting, peaceable two-state solution. Examples could include Israeli support for PA security reform efforts as part of a movement toward an \"economic peace\" that downgrades the importance of final-status negotiations or eventual Palestinian sovereignty, or PA/PLO claims that a supposed lack of Israeli reciprocity in response to PA security efforts is a sign of Israeli bad faith. ", "An additional concern is the economic and logistical sustainability of the PASF infrastructure. Given the PA's current dependence on the international donor community (on which it relies to defray its annual budget deficit of over $1 billion), some have queried whether the international community should be actively assisting the PA to (1) assume salary obligations for new PASF personnel and pay substantial pensions for retirees, (2) build new facilities with considerable fixed costs and maintenance obligations, and/or (3) acquire additional vehicles and equipment from widely different sources that call for different types of specialized maintenance. Some believe that this may prolong the PA's dependence on external assistance, and that the onus is on the United States (and other donors) to identify and cut unsustainable or unnecessary assistance because, although the recipient (in this case, the PA) may recognize that the assistance is suboptimal in one or more respects, the temptation to take what is offered might be too strong to refuse.

Assigned personnel should have Arabic-language skills and military experience and qualifications appropriate to the assignments they will be performing.", "What sufficient \"capacity\" might be for the USSC to proceed in its duties more robustly and expeditiously is open to debate. A senior Western official in the region has suggested that an ideal number of full-time staff (not including State Department contractors) might be between 50 and 80 (up from the current number of approximately 45). Others might seek to advance the U.S. interest in strengthening Palestinian moderates while at the same time keeping the U.S. \"footprint\" more modest. A European official in the region has suggested that \"Any expansion of the USSC should tally with PA needs and complement other donor commitments. Once this is gauged the mission will have a better picture of what it could do beyond what it is already doing.\u00a0It would then follow to look at what resources are needed.\"", "As discussed at various points above (see \" Counterterrorism and Consolidation: Comprehensiveness of USSC Role \" and \" Criminal Justice Sector Reform \"), some maintain that the U.S. mandate in security assistance matters should be expanded to give the USSC more comprehensive reach over all PA security organizations (including intelligence organizations), along with authority to help train and outfit these organizations more directly for counterterrorism operations, and perhaps also to give the State Department's INL Bureau an enhanced role in criminal justice sector reform. Expanding the USSC/INL mandate could involve increases both in personnel and in funding.", "On the other hand, giving USSC/INL too many tasks could hinder rather than help the security assistance effort by, among other things, spreading the USSC's resources too thin and distracting its attention from its core objectives of helping train and outfit the National Security Forces, helping the Ministry of Interior with strategic planning, and facilitating Israeli-Palestinian security coordination. One option may be to encourage USSC/INL to increase its emphasis on (and possibly to apportion greater resources toward) strategic planning and consultation aimed at further consolidating accountable, defactionalized civilian control within the MoI (see \" How U.S. Efforts Are Coordinated \" above). Thus far, $13.5 million out of the initial $295 million appropriated through the INCLE account has been apportioned to these efforts (see Table 1 above). Alternatively or concurrently, measures might be taken aiming to ensure that no other assistance programs to the PA security forces\u2014U.S. or foreign\u2014are obstructing the ability of USSC/INL (and partner programs such as EUPOL COPPS) to carry out its current mandate.

Others might say that this change might invite more risk than is advisable in light of the progress the mission has achieved under current operating standards.", "Some have called for executive action to exclude USSC staff from West Bank travel limitations, and have even proposed legislative action to transfer authority over the USSC mission from the State Department to the Defense Department in order to get rid of the limitations on both travel and on other matters relating to assistance. Yet, formally militarizing the mission could upset the current balance, under which the U.S. security assistance mission operates within a larger diplomatic context. Moreover, with the Defense Department's attention still very much focused on its military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, it might not be eager to assume full responsibility for this mission as well.

Possible parameters for benchmarks could include terrorist attack frequency; specific levels of criminality; and progress in dismantling terror networks, in consolidating accountable civilian control over all PA security organizations, and/or in coordination with Israel. Parameters could be tied to performance benchmarks for the PA and its security forces (with or without specific timetables) that could be verified through executive branch certification, direct congressional observation, or a third party specifically dedicated to the purpose. Whether proposed benchmarks are more quantitative/objective or qualitative/subjective in nature, they might not be particularly useful in charting progress if they are unable to isolate the impact of U.S. assistance on PA security reform discretely from possible intervening variables. ", "Another question to consider is whether and how benchmarks might be considered in the larger Israeli-Palestinian context. For example, might there be a way to have benchmarks that vary depending on the extent to which Israel might loosen restrictions on PA freedom and exclusivity of action in key areas and remove obstacles to movement (i.e., checkpoints)? Perhaps more qualitative evaluations of PA security progress could take into account reciprocal moves taken by Israel toward its Roadmap obligations (specifically, ceasing settlement activity) or on other measures of progress on the political track (such as progress on negotiations). Yet, benchmarks have their limitations in a complex environment where multiple and unforeseen variables might impact outcomes.

Additionally or alternatively, an option for Congress is for it to require periodic audits of U.S. security assistance to the PA by the Comptroller General/Government Accountability Office (GAO), much as it periodically requires GAO to audit the USAID West Bank and Gaza program and U.S. contributions to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).
