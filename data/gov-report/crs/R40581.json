The costs of health insurance and health care services are consuming a growing portion of workers' compensation, and the percentage of individuals with job-based health insurance coverage is declining. Some states are seeking reforms in their state systems, providing useful trials and errors to potentially inform the debate at the federal level. Just as the federal debate in the 1990s was spurred by rising health care and health insurance costs, declining numbers of individuals with private coverage, and state experimentation and innovation, those same issues are at the center of the debate today. Many of the issues addressed through health reform legislation are exacerbated by the existing recession."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "What Is Health Insurance Reform All About?", "paragraphs": ["Health insurance reform is a broad term spanning a large range of policy options, each of which has its own inherent strengths and weaknesses. Health insurance reform can focus on a discrete health insurance problem or issue, such as expanding public health insurance coverage for uninsured children or reducing the number of costly state benefit mandates and premium taxes on private health insurance plans. At the opposite end of the spectrum, however, are proposals that operate on a broader scale\u2014changing the way people access public and/or private health insurance, investing large amounts of government resources to assist individuals with the cost of health care or health insurance, reducing costs and improving quality. The wide variation across proposed reforms is one factor that makes a simple yet comprehensive discussion of all of the important options challenging. Other fundamental differences separating health insurance reform approaches include different objectives of reforms and different priorities among important stakeholders."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Different Objectives", "paragraphs": ["Health insurance reform may have a wide range of primary objectives, which can include the following:", "Reducing the number of people without health insurance. Most health insurance reforms seek to improve access to health insurance. In the United States, access to medical care is largely dependent on whether an individual has health insurance. Reducing the reliance on health insurance for at least some portion of needed medical care. Some approaches to reform reflect the position that part of the insurance problem in the United States is that people have too much of it\u2014that the presence of insurance has desensitized Americans to the cost of health care services, allowing both the demand for and the prices of medical care, whether necessary or unnecessary, to grow too quickly. Legislation may include provisions intended to encourage cost-consciousness in individuals' choices of health insurance and health care and include a group of approaches sometimes referred to as promoting \"consumer directed\" health care. Reducing the cost of health insurance. Some advocates of reform believe that the rising cost of health insurance must be addressed before other problems can be dealt with. Their reform approaches reflect the belief that more people will purchase insurance once more affordable plans are available. Thus, they assert reducing the number of uninsured is secondary to reducing the cost of the insurance. Cost-reducing approaches span the continuum, from preempting the application of state laws which increase the price of insurance, to establishing a single government payer for all health insurance. Advocates of single payer approaches believe such a system would improve administrative efficiencies, thereby reducing overall health insurance costs.", "Legislation has also been introduced in the 111 th Congress that features objectives related to improving the quality of medical care or the quality of health insurance products. Proposals to improve health outcomes, increase the availability of information about high-quality health care and providers, and establish disease management systems are raising interest among private insurers, government programs, and employers. These provisions alone, however, will not reduce the number of people without any insurance, and their effect on medical costs is as yet undetermined.", "What constitutes adequate health insurance is an important consideration that is beyond the scope of this report. Nonetheless, sponsors of bills extending coverage are likely to grapple with complex questions about the kind of coverage that should be extended. Sponsors of bills offering generous government subsidies for health insurance may feel that it is their duty to set a minimum standard for qualifying coverage as a way to ensure that taxpayers' funds are being used responsibly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prioritizing Among Stakeholders", "paragraphs": ["One of the challenges of undertaking comprehensive health insurance reform is that every U.S. legal resident is a stakeholder whose individual preferences and needs may differ. Reform approaches reflect different choices about the relative importance of needs among stakeholder groups, including federal, state, and local governments, health care providers, medical researchers, insurance carriers, employers, workers, and consumers.", "Needs can vary considerably among stakeholder groups, and even within them. For example, health care consumers may prefer low-cost health insurance obtained through lower profits to health insurers while, according to standard economic theory, those health insurers will seek to maximize profits. Within consumer groups, there are healthy people who may prefer limited insurance coverage or none at all, while elderly or less healthy consumers may prefer more comprehensive coverage. Sometimes meeting the needs of one group can exacerbate the problems encountered by others. For example, requiring health care premiums to be community rated\u2014that is, based on the average costs of everyone in a large group\u2014can reduce premiums for individuals with expensive medical conditions. On the other hand, community-rated rates could lead to higher premiums for the healthiest individuals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope of Reform", "paragraphs": ["Since the early 1990s, a number of incremental health insurance reforms have been enacted (see Text Box 1 ). Health insurance reform in the 111 th Congress may use a variety of approaches, ranging from incremental improvements that build on the nation's current patchwork of coverage to reforms of a much broader scope.", "A number of incremental reforms enacted over the past 15 years have improved the availability of health insurance for some populations. However, they have been built on a system in which some continue to have no access to any insurance and others to only unaffordable options, and the number of uninsured has continued to rise; such changes may also have exacerbated the loss of privately sponsored coverage. For example, a body of research has concluded that expanding Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) has generated some crowd-out of private coverage; on the other hand, children are the only subpopulation in which uninsurance rates have fallen over the past decade.", "Questions about the scope of reforms extend to the cost of the reform plans. At one end of the federal financing spectrum are approaches that feature subsidies for individuals to use toward the cost of health insurance. Such bills presume that a financial commitment from the federal government is essential to achieve universal or near-universal coverage, whether coverage is provided through government programs or private plans. A fair amount of research supports the notion that significant subsidies would be needed to induce many of the uninsured to purchase coverage.", "On the other end of the spectrum are a number of market reform approaches that reflect the position that government laws and regulations have raised the cost of insurance, reduced the number of options available to people, and created disincentives to purchase low-cost insurance. For example, state benefit mandates are blamed for increasing costs and reducing choices. Bills at this end of the spectrum aim to make the market for insurance work better, proposing to achieve higher coverage rates without subsidies because people would find health insurance products are more affordable by meeting, but not exceeding, their insurance needs."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "General Approaches to Health Insurance Reform", "paragraphs": ["While the 111 th Congress is still relatively new, several health insurance reform bills have already been introduced. These bills, as well as other proposals currently under consideration, can be classified as expanding coverage using one of the following approaches:", "Largely replace existing coverage with a national government-provided health insurance program (or a national health service). Expand existing public programs for certain individuals. Expand privately sponsored coverage. Encourage state-based reforms. Simultaneously expand private and public coverage options."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "National Government-Provided Health Insurance Program", "paragraphs": ["Some of the proposals introduced in the 111 th are directed at the creation of a national health insurance program. While the legislation can take a variety of forms, the general thrust of such proposals is to make basic health insurance available to all Americans so that access to health care would not be contingent on individuals' ability to pay or their employment status. These proposals all share at least three common features: replacement of most or all of the existing sources of coverage, universal entitlement to health care or health insurance, and government-provided health coverage.", "National health insurance legislation in the 111 th Congress generally takes one of two approaches: social insurance or a national health service. Under the social insurance approach, all individuals would obtain their health insurance through a government-administered and financed system. Medicare is an example of a social insurance program for elderly and disabled individuals. Private insurers can retain a role in such a system, essentially acting as contractors. In contrast, the national health service approach, modeled after systems like Britain's National Health Service, includes universal coverage, as well as reforms of some or all of the factors of health care production\u2014such as public ownership of hospitals, or public employment of physicians. Private insurers may or may not have a role in such a system.", "Because of the magnitude of the changes in such approaches, they could be subject to criticism, particularly about the level of governmental intrusion they would potentially introduce. The counterargument could be that the continuation of more incremental changes cannot be relied on to achieve universal or near universal insurance coverage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expand Existing Public Programs for Certain Individuals", "paragraphs": ["Members of the 111 th Congress have also introduced bills that would expand public health insurance programs for certain targeted groups of individuals. For example, legislation has been introduced to eliminate the two-year Medicare waiting period for people who are disabled. Other bills would expand Medicaid coverage to individuals who are not currently eligible for the program. None of these partial coverage bills are summarized at the end of this report. Instead, the list of introduced legislation is focused on only those bills that are not limited to particular demographic groups.", "Although the bills characterized in this section are not listed at the end of this report because of their narrow scope, that is not to suggest their impact would be insignificant. If one measures the success of past health insurance reforms by the number of previously uninsured individuals who obtained health coverage, then the expansion of public programs (Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP) must be considered great successes. For example, in the years after the creation of CHIP, the percentage of children who were uninsured fell by more than one-third; this is in contrast to a 12% increase of uninsured among non-aged adults over the same period.", "Legislation offered in the 111 th Congress would build on those programs to extend coverage to more uninsured individuals. One advantage that public program expansions have over other types of reforms is that the programs are already operational and their administrative costs may be lower, relative to the costs of benefits, than for typical private coverage. If the target population of a reform proposal is predominantly those who cannot afford private coverage, or if the proposal includes sliding scale subsidies, utilizing existing programs that already conduct income determinations and administer subsidies may be efficient.", "On the other hand, proposals to expand public coverage while maintaining the existing private market for insurance face an obstacle in \"crowd out.\" There is evidence that in the presence of expanding public coverage, private coverage will be lower than it would have been. This may lead to fewer new covered lives than expected and/or greater public expenditures than expected. However, analyses have concluded that when public programs cover the lowest income people, for whom few affordable private sources of coverage exist, crowd-out is low. But when public programs extend into higher income levels, crowd-out rises."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expand Privately Sponsored Coverage", "paragraphs": ["Private health insurance sponsored by employers covers more than 60% of the U.S. population. As a result, a major portion of health insurance in this country is funded privately by workers and their employers. Some of the bills focus on expanding employer-based or \"group\" coverage generally, and others address the particular needs of small employers or the problems present in the individual market for insurance. Still other approaches focus on freeing private markets for insurance from the laws, regulations, and incentives that raise costs and reduce flexibility, with the hope that such changes would improve the availability and affordability of health coverage."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Expanding Employer-Based Coverage", "paragraphs": ["Because more than 80% of uninsured individuals under age 65 are employed or are family members of a person with ties to employment, efforts to expand or strengthen the employer-based, or group, market for insurance can potentially be effective in reducing the number of uninsured. Work-focused approaches, of course, have limited impact on people who have no or tenuous ties to the workforce.", "Members of the 111 th Congress have introduced bills that would subsidize workers' or employers' share of premiums (directly or through tax credits, exclusions or deductions; see Text Box 2 ), mandate that some or all employers offer coverage, or improve pooling in the small employer market for insurance. Some of the proposals are intended to address the disadvantages that small employers face in providing health insurance as a benefit relative to large employers. (A number of these approaches are discussed more thoroughly in the \" Market Reforms \" section below.) Large employer groups are able to spread risk more broadly among their employees and enjoy economies of scale that keep per person administrative costs low. When a large employer self-insures, its health benefits are not subject to state insurance laws and regulation (because it is not defined as \"insurance\"). This, along with the broad risk spreading and low per person administrative costs, can confer a considerable cost advantage over similar benefit plans in the small group or individual markets for insurance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improving Access to Health Insurance in the Individual Market", "paragraphs": ["Most health insurance in the United States is obtained through employment. This is due to a number of factors\u2014workers perceive employers as paying for most of the cost of group health insurance, and payments for group plans have tax-advantaged status. Further, the cost of group plans is calculated for an entire group, whereas people in the individual, or non-group, market are often \"underwritten\" based on their own health status\u2014that is, the price of the insurance policy is based on an individual's own set of health conditions. While health underwriting could result in low-cost plans for healthy individuals seeking coverage, those with medical conditions could be at a significant price disadvantage relative to the price they might be charged if their premiums were averaged across an employment-based group. Insurers selling plans in many states can even refuse to sell to individuals with health conditions, or sell policies that exclude coverage for particular conditions and sometimes for entire body systems.", "Approaches addressing these issues are designed to make the individual market work better for more people. Potential advantages of improving the individual market for insurance include", "increasing individuals' choices (coverage options would not be limited to those chosen by their employer), and increasing the portability of health insurance (portable health insurance does not have to be discontinued when one leaves a job).", "Tools utilized by individual market bills include", "giving individually purchased insurance the same tax-advantaged status as employer-sponsored coverage, and providing subsidies for the purchase of coverage in the individual market.", "One option includes eliminating the tax benefits for employer-based health insurance premiums and replacing them with new tax benefits for coverage in the individual market. (See Text Box 3 for summaries of tax policies related to health insurance.) This is intended, over time, to provide incentives for people to move from employer-based coverage to coverage in the individual market. However, because of the market limitations discussed above, such as health underwriting, lack of guaranteed availability of plans, and the absence of employer contributions, these proposals by themselves may improve options for some individuals, but not others. For example, employer contributions fund a large portion of the nation's health insurance bills. Without replacing those funds, some people may find individual insurance less affordable than their employer-sponsored plan, at least in the short run. In addition, risk pooling in the individual market in many states is limited, and individual underwriting common. This could mean that if and when employers drop coverage, healthy people could easily find replacement policies in the individual market, but those less healthy and arguably most in need of health insurance could become a new and possibly needier group of uninsured. Finally, the administrative costs in an environment with few economies of scale are high. For these reasons, most bills proposing individual market solutions tend to be combined with other reforms addressing some of these issues. For example, some bills would establish a \"connector\" or \"exchange\" whose role could range from a simple clearinghouse for purchasing insurance (a Travelocity model) to an active participant in negotiating with plans and performing other functions. A connector or exchange might offer one plan or a selection of plans with enrollment available either to all small employers or to both small employers and individuals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Market Reforms", "paragraphs": ["Bills offered in the 111 th Congress may include other market improvements intended to make private health insurance more accessible and affordable. These approaches are intended to", "reduce state regulation of health insurance plans, with an objective of increasing affordability; broaden risk pools so that premiums for health insurance products are averaged over a larger group of individuals; and/or encourage \"consumer driven\" health plans and health choices.", "In general, such approaches would retain the current sources of coverage.", "States are primarily responsible for regulating the business of insurance. Over the years, states have developed a significant body of law dealing with all aspects of health insurance. State laws and regulations include patient protections, instructions on how insurance carriers may develop the rates charged for their products, and procedures for approval of those rates. They address how entities in the business of selling health insurance fund their enterprises and guard against the risk of insolvency. Insurance carriers are subject to fair marketing practice laws, requirements related to the filing of grievances against the plans, and appeals processes of plan decisions. States also have benefit requirements that ensure that certain medical services must be available for a product to be sold and marketed as health insurance.", "Proposals to reduce state regulation would move insurance markets closer to an unrestrained free market and would invariably reduce costs for some purchasers of health insurance. (However, they may increase costs for others.) They would also address insurers' complaints about the challenges of selling products across state lines when laws in some states are significantly different from others. Many of the state laws were developed, however, to protect consumers from certain business practices; bills that would preempt those state laws raise concerns about those business practices reemerging.", "Pooling proposals often focus specifically on small employers. Small employers have a harder time providing insurance to their employees for a number of reasons. Small groups are not able to spread their highest health risks broadly. As a result, premiums for small firms, particularly those with older or less healthy workers (or workers' dependents), are relatively high for similar benefits than for larger employers. Proposals encouraging small employers to join into health purchasing groups (sometimes called health insurance purchasing cooperatives or regional purchasing cooperatives) are meant to pool together those small groups, raising the number of individuals over which premiums are calculated. Bills encouraging professional and trade associations to offer coverage were considered in the 109 th and 110 th Congresses and were ostensibly about such pooling. In addition, those bills would provide regulatory relief for insurers selling products through associations. Most of those bills, however, did not require premiums to be calculated across the entire group, and so would not increase the size of the risk pools.", "Increasing the size of risk pools is one objective of bills that would establish programs similar to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). In general, those bills would identify an existing federal agency or create a new one to negotiate with a limited number of health plans. The coverage would be modeled on existing plans, such as those offered through FEHBP. In general, the bills would require that premiums for plans offered through the program would be averaged across all of the enrollees for each plan\u2014the largest possible risk pool. In addition, those bills usually include significant subsidies for low-income employees or individuals and sometimes for employers as well.", "Spreading risk broadly, however, is not a panacea. Community-rating (setting the level of premiums based on the average expenses of all subscribers) in an area could result in increased prices for young healthy people with low health risk and lower prices for those who are older or have health problems. If the goal of such approaches is to increase insurance coverage among those who need it most, this trade-off may be acceptable. If, however, the healthier and younger groups find their rates excessive, they may drop coverage altogether (where enrollment is voluntary), making the pool increasingly costly and undermining the objective of spreading risk.", "Only one state, New York, has \"pure community rating,\" where no individual-market premiums can vary by any individual factor, even age. More than 15 other states have taken other steps in the individual market, such as rate banding or adjusted/modified community rating (generally using at least age as a rating factor), that effectively pool some risk. Federal policies in this area might take into account the unique state markets that have developed in response to state laws to ensure that federal policies do not undermine improvements that states have already made.", "\"Consumer driven\" reforms are those that seek to encourage more choices for individuals in terms of the cost and coverage, and to raise cost consciousness, encouraging a preference for low-cost plans and better decision making about health care use. Ultimately, these reforms are intended to reduce overall premium growth and the use of marginally beneficial health care. For example, proposals to create tax preferences for high deductible health plans combined with health savings accounts are intended to encourage price reductions in coverage through several mechanisms: high deductible health insurance plans offer limited coverage relative to what may be covered by more typical comprehensive products, and health savings accounts encourage people to think more before seeking care for which money could be drawn from their account."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Encourage State-Based Reforms", "paragraphs": ["As in the early 1990s, state experimentation with health insurance reform is generating interest and discussion at the federal level. A number of states are experimenting with comprehensive insurance reforms toward a primary objective of achieving universal or near universal coverage (see Text Box 4 ). Some of these reforms may serve as a blueprint for federal changes, providing demonstrations that can better inform a federal debate. Many legislators, however, would rather have states continue to undertake reforms to address coverage gaps for their citizens. As a result, legislative proposals may include providing grant funds for states to continue and expand health insurance reforms on their own.", "Some maintain that state-led reform can better reflect local needs, particularly in smaller or more homogeneous states. Access to health insurance and health care can be very localized, reflecting the close relationship between private health insurance and local health care providers, labor markets and economic conditions.", "State-based reforms, however, face several significant obstacles. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) impedes states from passing certain laws that affect employer benefits, such as health insurance. For example, ERISA has generally pre-empted states' ability to require employers to offer or pay for health insurance. Further, states' track record includes a number of failed initiatives\u2014often related to inability to fund the rising costs of the reforms. States' ability to pay for reforms can be subject to the peaks and valleys of the states' tax collections. During challenging economic times, a need for state assistance of all kinds, including health insurance, rises often at the same time that states' tax base erodes, reducing states' ability to fund such needs.
