Critics of such conversions note that they often occur during the transitional period in which the outgoing Administration prepares to leave office and the incoming Administration prepares to assume office. Conversions are permissible when laws and regulations governing career appointments are followed, but they can invite scrutiny because of the differences in the appointment and tenure of noncareer and career employees.", "Appointments to career positions in the executive branch are governed by law and regulations that are codified in Title 5 of the United States Code and Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and are defined as personnel actions. In taking a personnel action, each department and agency head is responsible for preventing prohibited personnel practices; for complying with, and enforcing, applicable civil service laws, rules, and regulations and other aspects of personnel management; and for ensuring that agency employees are informed of the rights and remedies available to them. Such actions are required to adhere to the merit principles and prohibited personnel practices that are codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a72301(b) and \u00a72302(b), respectively. These principles and practices are designed to ensure that the process for selecting career employees is fair and open (competitive), and without political influence. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), on an ongoing basis, and the Government Accountability Office (GAO), periodically, each conduct oversight related to conversions of employees from noncareer to career positions to ensure that proper procedures have been followed. Certain senior politically appointed officers are prohibited from receiving financial awards during the Presidential Election Period, defined in statute and currently covering June 1, 2012, through January 20, 2013.", "As part of its oversight of government operations, Congress also monitors conversions. In the 110th Congress, staffing at the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS) and Justice (DOJ) was of particular interest, especially in the wake of the leadership and management deficiencies at DHS during and after Hurricane Katrina, and improper procedures used by DOJ staff in selecting and removing United States attorneys. Both departments received letters from Members of Congress reminding them to examine conversions: the Chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, Representative Bennie Thompson, wrote to the DHS Secretary in February 2008, and Senators Dianne Feinstein and Charles Schumer, members of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, wrote to the Attorney General in July 2008 about this issue. In a December 19, 2008, letter to OPM, Senator Joseph Lieberman requested information on conversions that occurred during the period April 1, 2008, through December 19, 2008. In February 2009 (111th Congress), Senator Feinstein sent a letter to the Secretary of Defense related to conversions within the Office of Detainee Affairs.", "In assessing the current situation, Congress may decide that the existing oversight is sufficient. If Congress determines that additional measures are needed, OPM could be directed to report to Congress on the operation of its current policy governing pre-appointment reviews, including recommendations on whether Section 1104 of Title 5, United States Code should be amended to codify the policy. The GAO and OPM could be asked to explore options that might result in their recommending and taking timely remedial actions that are seen as necessary to address conversions that occurred under improper procedures. Congress could amend Title 5, United States Code to increase the penalties for violating Civil Service laws.

This practice, commonly referred to as \"burrowing in,\" is permissible when laws and regulations governing career appointments are followed. While such conversions may occur at any time, frequently they do so during the transition period when one Administration is preparing to leave office and another Administration is preparing to assume office.", "Generally, these appointees were selected noncompetitively and are serving in such positions as Schedule C, noncareer SES, or limited tenure SES that involve policy determinations or require a close and confidential relationship with the department or agency head and other top officials. Many of the Schedule C appointees receive salaries at the GS-12 through GS-15 pay levels. The noncareer and limited tenure members of the SES receive salaries under the pay schedule for senior executives that also covers the career SES. Career employees, on the other hand, are to be selected on the basis of merit and without political influence following a process that is to be fair and open in evaluating their knowledge, skills, and experience against those of other applicants. The tenure of noncareer and career employees also differs. The former are generally limited to the term of the Administration in which they are appointed or serve at the pleasure of the person who appointed them. The latter constitute a work force that continues the operations of government without regard to the change of administrations.", "Paul Light, a professor of government at New York University, who has studied appointees over the past several administrations, reportedly believes that the pay, benefits, and job security of career positions underlie the desire of individuals in noncareer positions to \"burrow in.\" The President of the Senior Executives Association, Carol Bonosaro, echoed this viewpoint in stating that, \"Remember, not everybody who comes in is going to have a very high-profile job where they are going to be able to leave and make really good money.... Not everyone has had necessarily a strong enough background to go back out. They may just have been a campaign worker.\"", "Beyond the fundamental concern that the conversion of an individual from an appointed (noncareer) position to a career position may not have followed the legal and regulatory requirements, \"burrowing in\" raises other concerns. When the practice occurs, there may be these perceptions (whether valid or not): that an appointee converting to a career position may limit the opportunity for other employees (who were competitively selected for their career positions, following examination of their knowledge, skills, and experience) to be promoted into another career position with greater responsibility and pay; or that the individual who is converted to a career position may seek to undermine the work of the new Administration whose policies may be at odds with those that he or she espoused when serving in the appointed capacity. Both perceptions may increase the tension between noncareer and career staff, thereby hindering the effective operation of government at a time when the desirability of creating \"common ground\" between these staff to facilitate government performance continues to be emphasized."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Law and Regulations", "paragraphs": ["Appointments to career positions in the executive branch are governed by law and regulations that are codified in Title 5 of the United States Code and Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations .

The report could be included in the agency's annual performance plan that accompanies the budget justification submitted to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations each February. It could provide information on conversions that did not follow proper procedures and the remedial actions taken. OPM is authorized to review awards programs at departments and agencies. Congress could direct OPM to review awards granted in the executive branch and certify in its annual performance plan that awards were not granted during the Presidential Election Period. OPM also could be directed by Congress to report on whether any changes are needed in the time period for the Presidential Election Period, that restricts financial awards to senior politically appointed officers. As discussed above, the dates of the Presidential Election Period are defined by law, and in a presidential election year, cover the period from June 1 through the following January 20. Congress could mandate that the annual performance plans that accompany department and agency budget justifications submitted to Congress in February of each year include detailed information on conversions during the applicable fiscal year. The performance plans, submitted in the month following the inauguration of the President, could include a certification that awards were not granted during the Presidential Election Period. Departments and agencies could mandate that all officials with hiring authority be required to annually certify, in writing, that they understand the legal and regulatory requirements on the conversion of employees from appointed (noncareer) positions to career positions and on the prohibition on awards during the Presidential Election Period. A training session, that could be available electronically, could be provided to those officials who desire to review their knowledge and understanding of the procedures. A hiring official's failure to follow the proper procedures could be noted on the individual's performance evaluation. GAO and OPM could jointly explore options for the personnel agency, and the departments and agencies, to expedite the transmittal of information on conversions to GAO so that any necessary remedial actions can be recommended by GAO and taken by OPM quickly, and closer to the time that the conversions occurred. Congress could amend Title 5 United States Code to increase the penalties for violating Civil Service laws by \"creat[ing] a misdemeanor offense for agency personnel who violate or contribute to the violation of the federal hiring statutes.\" Congress could examine whether Title 5, United States Code should be amended to prohibit conversion from political to career positions."], "subsections": []}]}}
