In evaluating each proposal, Congress considers the subject of the proposed work; whether existing monuments and memorials commemorate similar subjects; and whether the sponsor group has requested an exemption from existing laws that might limit monument and memorial subjects and location within the District of Columbia. This report focuses on options for Congress for four types of exemptions to the Commemorative Works Act (CWA, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a78901-8909): siting works, use of specific materials, memorial completion deadlines, and the placement and status of museums.", "The CWA was enacted in 1986 to govern all monuments and memorials to be located on federal land in the District of Columbia under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service (NPS) or the General Services Administration (GSA). Further, the CWA sought to preserve the L'Enfant and McMillan plans for the capital; ensure continued public use and enjoyment of open spaces; and preserve, protect, and maintain the open space. Pursuant to the CWA, Congress statutorily authorizes a sponsor group to design and build a monument or memorial with the approval of regulatory bodies: the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (CFA). Additionally, the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission (NCMAC) was created to advise Congress, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Administrator of General Services on the commemorative works process. Unless otherwise stated in law, the sponsor group is responsible for funding the memorial without the use of federal funds.", "Since CWA's enactment, 33 commemorative works have been authorized, and numerous others have been proposed. Among the authorized and proposed works, several sponsor groups have sought\u2014and some have received\u2014exemptions from certain CWA provisions.", "The CWA divides the District of Columbia into three areas for the siting of monuments and memorials: an area where new commemorative works are prohibited (the Reserve); an area that requires congressional authorization (Area I); and all other NPS or GSA land (Area II). Some sponsor groups have been granted exemptions for siting monuments and memorials, and others have been approved to add new elements to existing commemorative works.", "The CWA requires that the NCPC and CFA evaluate a memorial's proposed building materials to ensure they are \"suitable to the outdoor environment.\" Some proposals have been made to require that those materials be American made, a requirement that does not currently exist. Additionally, sponsor groups are granted seven years in which to complete an authorized memorial or receive a construction permit to build the memorial. In many cases, memorials have needed additional time to be completed.", "The CWA also prohibits the siting of museums on NPS- or GSA-administered land in the District of Columbia. In 2003, however, Congress provided an exemption to the National Museum of African American History and Culture. The granting of this exemption arguably suggests that Congress believes the CWA applies to museums at any District location, if they are located on NPS- or GSA-administered land.

Second, the CWA was amended during the 108 th Congress (2003-2004), to limit the placement of monuments and memorials on the National Mall and to designate three distinct areas within the District of Columbia for monument and memorial construction. They and their boundaries are noted below.", "The Reserve is \"the great cross-axis of the Mall, which generally extends from the United States Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial, and from the White House to the Jefferson Memorial .\" Area I is reserved for commemorative works of \"preeminent historical and lasting significance to the United States,\" and roughly bounded by the West Front of the Capitol; Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.

For example, H.R. 222 (113 th Congress), as introduced, would have authorized a World War I Memorial in the District of Columbia. In addition to authorizing the World War I Memorial Foundation to establish a commemorative work, the bill would exempt the memorial from the CWA prohibition against placement in the Reserve.", "Further, other legislation authorized the placement of a new element at the site of an existing commemorative work.

Mandating the use of American materials in the construction of commemorative works could provide assurances that national memorials would be constructed of American materials.

Masaryk, and Victims of the Ukrainian Manmade Famine of 1932-1933\u2014were sponsored by foreign governments. Such memorial sponsors might prefer to use material native to their countries when building a memorial. Further, some memorial designers might find inspiration in non-American materials and want to use them as part of the memorial. Such design elements may or may not be appropriate, but would likely need to be reviewed by NCPC and CFA pursuant to the CWA.", "Mandating the use of American materials may also have cost implications. American-made materials might be more or less expensive than imported materials. Further, in instances where a new element has been authorized at an existing memorial it might be desirable to match materials to the existing memorial, regardless of the material's origin. For example, if a new element was added to an existing memorial which was built from Italian marble, it might not be possible to match materials, if necessary, from domestic sources. In this case, consideration of an exemption to the American-made requirement might be requested by the memorial sponsor or designer.", "Should Congress choose not to amend the CWA to require American-made materials, the decision would likely continue to reside with the federal planning bodies currently charged with approving memorial designs pursuant to the CWA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Deadline for Memorial Completion", "paragraphs": ["In 1986, when the CWA was enacted, sponsor groups were given five years from the date of enactment to complete the memorial or receive a construction permit.
