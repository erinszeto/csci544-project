Sharp criticism came from the West and Central African countries during various DohaRound meetings. Also, efforts to create a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FAA) foundered at leastpartially over U.S. cotton subsidies. Now, Congress is watching to see if the United States will berequired by the World Trade Organization (WTO) to revise its cotton subsidies in response to adispute lodged by Brazil.", "One reason the international spotlight is on U.S. cotton subsidies, in contrast to other subsidizing nations, is the sheer size of U.S. cotton production and exports.

Domestically, what happens to cotton subsidies is importantto a broad group of interests because grains, oilseeds, and peanuts receive similar support.", "U.S. cotton production and export subsidies provide comprehensive support for producers. Farmers with a history of cotton production are eligible for direct and counter-cyclical payments. On their actual production, farmers may utilize the marketing loans and loan deficiency payments. Protection against low yields is available through subsidized crop insurance, and in some yearsCongress has approved additional disaster payments. When U.S. market prices rise, and there is arisk that competitors might capture more of the world export market and even deliver to U.S. yarnand fabric mills, so-called Step 2 user payments are made to U.S. exporters and mills if theypurchase U.S. cotton.", "From 1991 through 2003 farm subsidies for cotton production have cost $1.76 billion per year, on average.

Additionally, the RMA pays the private agencies nearly 24%of total premiums toward their administrative costs, plus RMA's own administrativecosts, which have averaged 4% of total premiums.", "By design, the crop insurance program is supposed to be actuarially sound. In other words, over time total premiums (producer plus government premiumcontributions) are supposed to cover total indemnities. In practice, however, the ratioof cotton losses to premiums from 1991 through 2003 has averaged 1.3 to 1, and onlyin two years did premiums exceed indemnities. The net losses (indemnities overpremiums) fall upon the federal government because it reinsures the privatelymarketed policies. Critics of the crop insurance program argue that the highpremium subsidy and the lack of actuarial soundness imply that the program ismerely another tool for transferring government funds to cotton farmers.", "Substantial revisions were made to the crop insurance program by Congress in 1994 ( P.L. 103-354 , Title I, Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994) thateffectively mandated the participation of farm subsidy program recipients in cropyear 1995. While the mandatory provisions were eliminated the subsequent year,increased federal insurance subsidies enacted in 2000 ( P.L. 106-224 , AgriculturalRisk Protection Act of 2000) encouraged participation to rise above 90% of plantedcotton acres.", "From 1991 through 2003, the federal cost of crop insurance annually has covered an average 10.9 million planted cotton acres. The net federal cost ofpremium subsidies and the excess of indemnities over premiums averaged $219million per year (see Figure 14 ). These expenditures can be considered subsidies indirect support of farm income. Indirectly benefitting farmers were the reimbursementof private insurance agency administrative costs and federal administrative costs thattogether averaged an estimated $74 million per year.", "Counting only the $219 million annual average premium and indemnity subsidies, the average subsidy rate per pound of actual cotton production was $0.026over the 1991 through 2003 time period. When the 1995 through 2003 post-reformperiod is examined alone, the subsidy rate is higher, at $0.032/lb.", "Crop Disaster Payments. Congress, on an ad hoc basis, has mandated disaster payments above and beyondinsurance indemnities and also to producers who chose to not buy insurance. Overthe nine years from 1995 through 2003, when an average of 90% of planted cottonacreage was insured, annual disaster payments ranged from zero (in 6 of the years)to $444 million. The average was $100 million per year (see Figure 14 ), equaling$0.01/lb. of production over that time period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Special Competitiveness Provisions", "paragraphs": ["The farm income support programs are supplemented with additional tools to maintain sales of U.S. upland cotton when domestic prices are not low enough to becompetitive in international markets.

Step 2 pays domestic mills and exporters that purchase U.S. cottonwhen domestic prices are higher than world cotton prices. And Step 3 permitsspecial (increased) import quotas when domestic prices are higher than world cottonprices so that domestic mills have adequate supplies. Also, a separate limited globalimport quota for upland cotton (which was adopted prior to the Step 1, Step 2, andStep 3 provisions) remains in effect.", "Step 1 Loan Repayment Rate Reduction. The Step 1 adjustment provision was initially adoptedby the USDA under its administrative authority on October 3, 1989. Congress putthe Step 1 provision into statute in the 1990 farm bill ( P.L. 101-624 , Sec. 501). Boththe 1996 and 2002 farm bills retained the Step 1 authority, but with technicalchanges. However, the USDA has not taken action under Step 1 since 1992.", "Marketing loan gains and loan deficiency payments are calculated as the difference between the loan rate and the adjusted world price (AWP). Only when theAWP is below the loan rate do farmers receive a subsidy payment. A provision ofthe law allows the USDA to lower the AWP when the price of U.S. upland cottonsold in Northern Europe (USNE) is higher than the price of competing cotton. Thisauthority to reduce the AWP is unique to cotton and creates the opportunity forincreased marketing loan program subsidies, even when the price of upland cottonis higher than the loan rate.", "A Step 1 downward adjustment to the Adjusted World Price (AWP) may be made when the five-day average of the U.S. Northern European price (USNE)exceeds the Northern European price (NE), and the AWP is less than 115% of theloan level. In this circumstance, the USDA may lower the AWP up to the differencebetween the USNE price and the NE price. In other words, when the AWP is lessthan $0.598 (115% of $0.52), it can be adjusted downward by the difference betweenthe higher USNE price and the lower NE price. The practical result of a Step 1adjustment is to enable loan deficiency payments when US prices are higher than theloan price of $0.52, and to increase the loan deficiency payment rate by increasingthe spread between the AWP and the loan price.", "Step 2 Payments to Domestic Mill Users and Exporters. Step 2, first enacted in the 1990 farm bill and officiallyknown as Upland Cotton User Marketing Certificates, provides subsidy payments todomestic users and exporters of U.S.-produced cotton when its price is higher thanforeign-produced competing cotton. By offsetting the price difference with directpayments, Step 2 encourages U.S. yarn and fabric mills and exporters to purchaseU.S. cotton. In other words, the subsidy payment to buyers makes higher-priced U.S.cotton competitive in the marketplace with lower-priced foreign cotton. Currently,Step 2 requires that through July 31, 2008, payments in either cash or marketingcertificates be made to domestic users and exporters for documented purchases ofU.S.-upland cotton when the USNE price of upland cotton exceeds the NE price fora consecutive four-week period. Step 2 payments are not made if the AWP exceeds134% of the loan rate, or $0.697/lb. Similar user payments were adopted for ELScotton in 1999 and are authorized through July 31, 2008. Figure 15 shows yearly(August 1-July 31) payments (but the expenditures are for all cotton, not necessarilycotton produced in that crop year).

The United States maintains a tariff rate quota on imported upland cotton of 173.09million pounds (equivalently, 360.6 thousand bales or 86.545 thousand metric tons). The duty is nominal below the quota quantity, ranging from zero to $0.05/lb. Abovethe quota quantity trigger, the duty increases to a prohibitively high $0.1424/lb.($0.314/kg). In periods of short domestic supply (due possibly to weather-relatedproduction shortages) and strong world demand, U.S. mills might have insufficientsupplies. So-called Step 3 special import quotas allow for increased imports exemptfrom the high duty.", "Step 3 requires that a \"special import quota\" be opened if, for a consecutive four-week period, the USNE price, adjusted for Step 2 payments in effect theprevious week, exceeds the NE price. Another trigger for opening a Step 3 quota isa decline in the U.S. stocks-to-use ratio to below 16%. The size of the quota is equalto one week's domestic mill consumption. Importers have 90 days to make thepurchases and 180 days to bring the cotton into the country. Quota periods canoverlap. Total Step 3 imports in any crop year are limited to five weeks of domesticmill use.", "In practice, annual U.S. imports of cotton are much less than the 173 million pound tariff-rate quota. The USDA estimates that cotton imports will total about 19million pounds (40 thousand bales) in the 2003/04 marketing year.", "Limited Global Import Quota. A \"limited global import quota\" for upland cotton equal to 21 days of domestic millconsumption is allowed (at below tariff rate duty levels) when spot market pricesshow sustained strength for a three-year period. This allows domestic mills accessto lower-priced foreign cotton, helping them to compete with foreign mills. Limitedglobal import quotas cannot overlap with one another.
