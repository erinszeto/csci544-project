The market structure of the health insurance and hospital industries may have contributed to rising health care costs and deteriorating access to affordable health insurance and health care. Many features of the health insurance market and the ways it links to other parts of the health care system can hinder competition, lead to concentrated markets, and produce inefficient outcomes. Health insurers are intermediaries in the transaction of the provision of health care between patients and providers: reimbursing providers on behalf of patients, exercising some control over the number and types of services covered, and negotiating contracts with providers on the payments for health services. Consequently, policies affecting health insurers will likely affect the other parts of the health care sector.", "The market structure of the U.S. health insurance industry not only reflects the nature of health care, but also its origins in the 1930s and its evolution in succeeding decades. Before World War II, many commercial insurers doubted that hospital or medical costs were an insurable risk. But after the rapid spread of Blue Cross plans in the mid-1930s, several commercial insurers began to offer health coverage. By the 1950s, commercial health insurers had become potent competitors and began to cut into Blue Cross's market share in many regions, changing the competitive environment of the health insurance market.", "Evidence suggests that health insurance markets are highly concentrated in many local areas. Many large firms that offer health insurance benefits to their employees have self-insured, which may put some competitive pressure on insurers, although this is unlikely to improve market conditions for other consumers. The exercise of market power by firms in concentrated markets generally leads to higher prices and reduced output\u2014high premiums and limited access to health insurance\u2014combined with high profits. Many other characteristics of the health insurance markets, however, also contribute to rising costs and limited access to affordable health insurance. Rising health care costs, in particular, play a key role in rising health insurance costs.", "Complex interactions among health insurance, health care providers, employers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, tax policy, and the medical technology industry have helped increase health costs over time. Reducing the growth trajectory of health care costs may require policies that affect these interactions.

Future growth in health care costs is projected to threaten the fiscal position of state and federal governments unless major policy changes occur. Additionally, for many Americans, the lack of health insurance coverage complicates access to health care. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 46.3 million or 15.4% of the people in the United States lack health insurance coverage. Furthermore, even families with health insurance may become vulnerable to the financial burdens of a serious health condition or illness either because of the narrowness of plan benefits or the unpredictability of decisions about what care is covered. Increases in health insurance premiums, according to some research, has degraded access to health care.", "Health insurance markets are often highly concentrated with one insurer accounting for over 50% of the market. Concerns about concentration in health insurance markets are linked to wider concerns about the cost, quality, and availability of health care. The market structure of the health insurance and hospital industries may have played a role in rising health care costs and in limiting access to affordable health insurance and health care. Some argue market concentration has led to higher health care prices. Higher prices for health care or health care insurance may then make health care less affordable and thus less accessible for some families. Consumers in the individual and small group markets typically face particularly challenging conditions.", "Others, however, contend that health insurers with strong bargaining leverage might help constrain health providers' ability to raise prices, and that the benefit of lower premiums resulting from that ability to bargain may be passed along to consumers.

The first commercial health insurance policies were offered in 1847 in Philadelphia, although those plans soon failed. A few private insurers began to offer individual accident insurance in the 1860s. In the last quarter of the 19 th century some railroad, mining, and timber firms began to offer workplace health benefits. In the 1890s, burial and sickness policies became more popular, and the first group accident and health plans were developed. ", "As population shifted from rural agricultural regions to industrialized urban centers, workers were exposed to risks of occupational accidents, but had less support from extended family networks that provided informal insurance benefits. Many workers obtained accident or sickness policies through fraternal organizations, labor unions, establishment plans, or private insurers. Economic historian John Murray estimated that roughly one-third of World-War-I-era male industrial workers had some form of accident, health, or burial insurance. These policies were often indemnity plans, that would pay a set cash amount in the event of a serious accident or health emergency. Social surveys at the turn of century spotlighted the link between industrial accidents and poverty, leading Progressive-era reformers and labor unions to push for compulsory social insurance, which helped lead to workers' compensation programs. Progressive movement reformers, however, were unable to convince unions, employers, and politicians to institute German- or United Kingdom-style health insurance programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "How the \"Blues\" Began", "paragraphs": ["The modern health insurance industry in the United States was spurred by the onset of the Great Depression. In 1929, the Baylor University Hospital in Dallas created a pre-paid hospitalization benefit plan for school teachers after a hospital executive discovered that unpaid bills accumulated by local educators were a large burden on hospital finances as well as on the teachers themselves. Unlike earlier health insurance policies, subscribers were entitled to hospital care and services rather than a cash indemnity. While the plan did not cover physician bills, it did improve enrollees' ability to pay those charges.", "The Baylor Plan was soon extended to other groups. Other hospitals in Dallas quickly followed suit with their own group hospitalization plans as a means of ensuring a steady revenue source in difficult economic times. For individuals, these plans offered a way to obtain hospital care at a reasonable and predictable cost. In 1932, local hospitals in Sacramento, CA, created a joint plan for group hospitalization benefits, and in 1933, hospitals in Essex County, New Jersey, offered a similar plan. Community-based plans in St. Paul, MN, Washington, DC, and Cleveland were created soon afterwards. The Blue Cross emblem, first used by the St. Paul plan, was widely adopted by other prepaid hospital benefit plans adhering to American Hospital Association (AHA) guidelines.", "The AHA's 1933 guidelines required prepaid group hospitalization plans using the Blue Cross symbol to stress the public welfare, limit benefits to hospital charges, organize as a non-profit, and run on a sound economic basis. While many of the early group hospitalization plans were organized by community leaders, voluntary hospitals controlled Blue Cross because they provided the key resources in most cases and because they were responsible for underwriting the policies. Through the 1930s, the number of Blue Cross plans grew and enrollments expanded. By 1937, 1 million subscribers were covered, and by 1939, 25 states had passed legislation to enable hospitalization plans. Many state laws deemed Blue Cross plans charitable community organizations that were exempted from certain insurance regulations and taxes.", "The health insurance market in the United States, according to many historians, was originally structured to avoid competition among providers. The earliest plans tied benefits to a single sponsoring hospital; each hospital plan competed with others. Groups or individuals with the option to negotiate with specific hospitals might have been able to exert bargaining power. Hospital and professional groups, however, soon pushed for joint plans that required \"free choice of physicians and hospital,\" rather than plans offered by individual hospitals. Joint plans dampened incentives for local hospitals to compete on the basis of price or generosity of plan benefits. The American Hospital Association strongly favored joint plans that allowed a subscriber to obtain care from any licensed local hospital and viewed single-hospital plans as a threat to the economic stability of community hospitals. Furthermore, in 1937, the AHA required Blue Cross plans to have exclusive territories so that they would not compete against each other. ", "Hospital and physician groups' opposition to competition in health care and health insurance dovetailed with more general criticism of \"destructive competition\" that was widespread in the early 1930s. Some business leaders and New Deal policymakers viewed heightened competition as the cause of sharp cuts in wages, which in their view reduced consumer buying power and drove price deflation and market instability during the early years of the Great Depression. Most economists believe measures to reduce market competition imposed during the Great Depression actually retarded economic recovery. Competition in health insurance markets, however, raises issues that do not apply in most markets. If health insurers adopt different underwriting standards, competition can make pooling risks more difficult, an issue discussed in more detail below.", "Insurance coverage of physician services lagged behind the growth of Blue Cross hospital plans due to opposition from the American Medical Association (AMA) and restrictive state laws. In several states, however, medical societies set up prepaid service plans to preempt proposed state or federal plans, which evolved into Blue Shield plans. In most states, Blue Shield was absorbed into Blue Cross plans, although some retained separate governing boards.", "Blue Cross plans accelerated their growth during World War II and extended to almost all states by 1946. Wartime wage and price controls authorized in October 1942 excluded \"reasonable\" insurance and pension benefits. As industries struggled to expand war production, many employers used health insurance and other fringe benefits to attract new workers. In the late 1940s, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) successfully sued employers that refused to bargain collectively over fringe benefits, opening the way for unions to negotiate with employers over health insurance, which further helped boost enrollments in health insurance plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tax Advantages For Employer-Provided Health Insurance Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Prior to 1954, no explicit statutory provision excluded health insurance benefits from federal income taxation. The IRS, however, had indicated in 1943 that group health insurance premiums paid by a firm for its employees would be considered an \"ordinary and necessary\" business expense rather than as taxable income received by the employee. A major overhaul of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 included Section 106, which explicitly excluded employer contributions for health insurance from employees' taxable income. The tax exclusion for employer-provided health care made health insurance cheaper than non-tax-advantaged forms of consumption for individuals. One study found that health insurance coverage following the 1954 tax changes expanded more rapidly among employees with higher incomes, who generally had marginal tax rates, which could indicate that the tax exclusion led workers to demand more extensive or generous plans. Other factors, such as rising income levels, competition for workers, and rising medical costs, also spurred growth in employer-provided health benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Commercial Insurers Enter", "paragraphs": ["Before World War II, many commercial insurers doubted that hospital or medical costs were an insurable risk. Insurers traditionally considered a risk insurable only if the potential losses were definite, measurable and not subject to control by the insured. The financial risks linked to illness or injury, however, could vary depending on the judgment of medical personnel, and behavior of the insured could affect the probability of ill health in many ways. After the rapid spread of Blue Cross plans in the mid-1930s, however, several commercial insurers began to offer similar health coverage. By the 1950s, commercial health insurers had become potent competitors and began to cut into Blue Cross's market share in many parts of the country. The large-scale entry of commercial insurers into the health insurance market changed the competitive environment in two ways. First, Blue Cross organizations, which had been sheltered from competition by exclusive territory and free-choice-of-hospital rules, were now engaged in head-to-head competition with commercial rivals. ", "Second, the commercial health insurers were not bound to set premiums using the Blue Cross community rating principle, which linked premiums to average claims costs across a geographic area rather than to the claims experience of particular groups or individuals. Therefore, commercial insurers using an \"experience rating\" approach were able to underbid Blue Cross for firms that employed healthier-than-average individuals, which on average were cheaper to insure. The loss of healthier groups then raised average costs among remaining groups, which hampered Blue Cross organizations' ability to compete with commercial insurers on price. Competition from commercial insurers compelled Blue Cross to adopt experience rating in the 1950s, although most Blue Cross plans continued to support efforts to broaden risk pools. The shift toward experience rating changed the nature of competition in the health insurance market. Insurers could cut costs by shifting risks to others, by recruiting firms whose employees and their families were healthier than average, rather than finding more efficient ways of managing risks for a given pool of subscribers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Introduction of Medicare and Medicaid", "paragraphs": ["By the late 1950s, health insurance benefits had become a standard part of compensation packages among most major employers. In 1959, Congress created the Federal Employees' Health Benefit Plan (FEHBP), which provided Blue Cross and Blue Shield benefits to federal workers across the country. During the late 1950s, hospital costs rose sharply in many parts of the United States due to new hospital construction, the increasing capital intensity of inpatient care, the replacement of flat-rate per diem reimbursement for hospitals with retrospective full-cost payment, and the spread of health insurance benefits that increased patients' ability to pay. Those cost increases led many Blue Cross affiliates to request large premium increases, which raised public concern and resistance from many state insurance regulators. These pressures, according to some historians, led Blue Cross affiliates and voluntary hospitals to push states to enact certificate of need (CON) regulations in the mid-1960s to deflect more stringent cost control measures while raising barriers to entry to newer and proprietary hospitals.", "While Blue Cross/Blue Shield and commercial insurance plans covered a large portion of employees and their dependents at the end of the 1950s, many low-income and elderly people had trouble obtaining affordable health insurance or paying for health care. Congress in the 1950s began to provide federal aid to states that chose to cover health care costs of these groups. Social Security was extended to pay providers to cover certain medical costs incurred by aged, blind, and disabled beneficiaries starting in 1950. The Kerr-Mills Act of 1960 (P.L. 86-778), a forerunner of Medicaid, supported state programs that paid providers for health care of the \"aged, blind, or permanently and totally disabled,\" as well as low-income elderly individuals. State governments, subject to certain federal requirements, retained substantial discretion over benefit levels and income limits, which were typically linked to welfare assistance programs. By 1965, 40 states had implemented Kerr-Mills programs, and three more had authorized plans. Less than 2% of the elderly, however, were covered by Kerr-Mills programs in 1965.", "In 1965, the Johnson Administration worked with Ways and Means Committee Chairman Wilbur Mills to create the Medicare program, which provided health insurance for nearly all Americans over age 65. Medicare combined a compulsory hospital insurance program (Part A) with a voluntary physician services plan (Part B). While some had worried that Medicare would displace private insurers, Blue Cross organizations became fiscal intermediaries for Medicare, responsible for issuing payments to providers and other back office operations. Medicaid, created in the same 1965 act, is a means-tested program financed by federal and state funds. Each state designs and administers its own program under federal rules. Over time, Medicaid eligibility standards and federal requirements have become more complex.", "Private health insurance companies play an important role in several federal health programs.

A health plan designed for southern California construction workers in the mid-1930s eventually became the Kaiser Health Plan. Some physicians set up group practices and clinics in the 1920s and 1930s. Many health care cooperatives were formed by employers, employee groups, and the federal governments during the 1930s and 1940s. While some of these plans prospered locally or regionally, they did not achieve national reach until the 1970s.", "In 1971, President Nixon announced a program to encourage prepaid group plans that joined insurance and care functions as a way to constrain the growth of medical care costs, which had risen sharply in the years following the startup of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and to enhance competition in the health insurance market. Advocates claimed that health maintenance organizations (HMOs), which integrate health care and health insurance functions, would have a financial motive to promote wellness and would lack incentives to overprovide care. The Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973 ( P.L. 93-222 ) provided new grants, loans and loan guarantees to expand the number of HMOs, which then only numbered about 30, so that 90% of the country would have access to HMOs in 10 years. ", "While this ambitious goal was not reached in the 1970s, by the late 1980s policymakers and businesses began to view greater use of managed care organizations such as HMOs and similar organizations as a key strategy for controlling health care costs. In the mid-1990s, the broader use of more restrictive forms of managed care (such as stringent gatekeeper, second medical opinion, and pre-approval requirements) sparked strong consumer resistance, which forced an industry retreat from some of those strategies. Networks of providers, known as preferred provider organizations (PPOs), grew rapidly in the late 1980s and early 1990s. PPOs, often owned by hospital systems and other providers, typically contract with insurers or self-insured firms and offer discounted fee-for-service (FFS) rates. PPO enrollees who receive care outside of the network typically must obtain plan approval or pay more. Thus, a PPO plans provided patients with more flexibility than staff-model HMOs, which generally did not cover care provided outside of the HMO. As various types of managed care plans such as HMOs and PPOs became widespread, more employers offered choices among competing health plans to let workers willing to pay higher premiums avoid restrictive plans.

The Internal Revenue Service regulations had regarded Blue Cross organizations as tax exempt community service organizations since their inception in the 1930s. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 ( P.L. 99-514 ) removed Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans' tax exemption because Congress believed that \"exempt charitable and social welfare organizations that engage in insurance activities are engaged in an activity whose nature and scope is inherently commercial rather than charitable,\" and that \"the tax-exempt status of organizations engaged in insurance activities provided an unfair competitive advantage.\" The 1986 act retained some limited tax advantages to reflect Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans' provision of community-rated health insurance, especially in the individual and small-group markets.", "In the 1990s, many health insurers struggled with rising health care costs and sharper criticism of industry practices. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of West Virginia went bankrupt and several other Blue Cross/Blue Shield affiliates faced serious financial difficulties. In 1994, Blue Cross/Blue Shield guidelines were amended to let affiliates reorganize as for-profit insurers, leading the way for more than a dozen Blue Cross/Blue Shield affiliates to convert to for-profit status. Other Blue Cross/Blue Shield insurers bought other insurers, merged, or restructured in other ways. At the same time, private insurers acquired HMOs and other managed care organizations. Consolidations reduced both the number of commercial and Blue Cross/Blue Shield organizations, leading to the emergence of a small number of very large insurers with strong market positions across the country. For example, the commercial insurer Anthem acquired Blue Cross/Blue Shield affiliates located in Colorado, Connecticut, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, Virginia, and Wisconsin. In 2004, Anthem bought WellPoint Inc., which had acquired Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans in California, Georgia, and New York, and now operates under the WellPoint name.

Most individuals are willing to pay an insurer to assume the bulk of financial risks associated with unpredictable health outcomes of uncertain severity. Health insurance is a method of pooling risks so that the financial burden of medical care is distributed among many people. Some insured people will become sick or injured and incur significant medical expenses. Most people, however, will remain relatively healthy, thus incurring little or no medical expenses. While it is difficult to predict who will incur high expenses, the average medical expense among a large group of people is more predictable. Insurance pools the medical expenses of the insured, who pay for the expenses through their premiums. In essence, money is shifted from those who remain healthy to those who become sick or injured.", "The health insurance market is tightly interrelated with other parts of the health care system. Consequently, many parties play a role in the health insurance market. Health insurers are intermediaries in the transaction of the provision of health care between patients and providers\u2014health insurers are a third-party who reimburse providers on behalf of patients. Health insurers not only reimburse providers, but also typically have some control over the number and types of services covered and negotiate contracts with providers on the payments for health services\u2014most health insurance plans are managed care plans (HMOs, PPOs) rather than indemnity or traditional health insurance plans that provide unlimited reimbursement for a fixed premium. Other parties involved in the health insurance market include employers (most private health insurance is obtained through an employer), federal, state and local governments, and health care providers. The federal government directly provides health insurance through Medicare. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health system provides health care benefits, and military health systems provide both health insurance and health care benefits. States and the federal government share responsibility for Medicaid and private health insurance industry regulation.", "The health insurance market has many features that push it far from the economic benchmark of perfect competition. Perfectly competitive markets, according to economic theory, allocate goods and services efficiently if certain conditions are met. Markets allocate goods and services efficiently when the social cost of the resources (e.g., labor, buildings, machinery, raw materials) used to make the last unit sold equals the social benefit of consuming that unit. Conditions required to ensure the efficiency of competitive markets include the following:", "many buyers and sellers\u2014each participant is small in relation to the market and cannot affect the price through its own actions; neither consumption nor production generates spillover benefits or costs; free entry and exit from the market\u2014new firms can open up shop and existing firms can costlessly leave the market as conditions change; symmetric information\u2014all market participants know the same things so that no one has an informational advantage over others; no transaction costs\u2014the buyers and sellers incur no additional cost in making the transaction, and the complexity of decisions has no effect on choices; and firms maximize profits and consumers maximize well-being.", "Competitive markets may allocate goods inefficiently if those conditions are not met. Most of these conditions often fail to hold in the health insurance market. Departures from these conditions can hinder markets and lead to inefficient outcomes. Reforms are most likely to be effective, according to some economists, when they are tied to underlying structural causes of poor market performance.

Consequently, consumers typically set up relationships with various intermediaries in advance. This can provide benefits as well as limit consumer choice. Health insurers (public and private) make the bulk of health care payments. As Figure 1 shows, national health expenditures paid through federal, state and local, and private insurance as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) have increased since 1960, while the proportion paid by consumers out of pocket has slightly decreased. In other words, over the past 40 years consumer out-of-pocket spending in real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) terms has grown slightly more slowly than the U.S. economy, while health expenditures paid through other sources have grown faster than the U.S. economy.", "How insurers design health care networks influences how consumers use health care. Consumers typically choose a primary physician who selects tests and treatments and makes referrals to medical specialists. Employers negotiate with insurers on behalf of their workers, and labor unions negotiate with employers over health benefits on behalf of their members. Health insurers, in turn, negotiate contracts with providers and handle payments for individual services. A primary physician's admitting privileges typically determine where his patient goes for non-emergency hospital care. Patients must go through a physician to obtain most medical tests and pharmaceuticals. Health care consumers typically rely on these intermediaries instead of interacting directly with other parts of the health care system. This heavy reliance on intermediaries is a key characteristic of the current health care market.", "Consumers benefit from the specialized expertise of intermediaries, such as employers, insurers, and physicians, as they navigate the health care system. Consumers also may benefit from the bargaining power of their employer or health insurer, in much the same way as they may benefit from the market power of a very large retailer (such as Walmart or Costco) when they buy ordinary consumer goods. Intermediaries may also help patients navigate the fragmented and complex structure of the U.S. health care system. Patients may depend on physicians and health insurers to intermediate with a highly diverse array of health care providers, such as imaging centers, specialized surgery centers, public health clinics, hospice organizations, home health care providers, nursing homes, as well as other health care providers.", "Using intermediaries such as health insurers protects consumers from financial risks linked to serious medical problems, but also insulates consumers from information about costs and prices for specific health care goods and services. When a third-party, such as a private insurer or a government, pays for the bulk of health care costs, consumers may demand more care and providers may wish to supply more care. Links among intermediaries and providers can also limit consumers' choices. For example, a person's job may limit her health insurance choices, and another person's choice of physician may limit choices among hospitals.", "Some families and individuals lacking these intermediaries must navigate the health insurance and health care system themselves, which may be a serious challenge. People without health insurance coverage are not only vulnerable to the financial risks accompanying serious medical problems, but may also pay higher prices for care because they lack the bargaining leverage of insurers. Hospitals and physicians have charged individuals who pay their own bills far more than they charge insurance companies and public health programs. Generous tax advantages for employer-sponsored plans do not help those who buy health insurance in the individual market. Those without a regular primary care physician may struggle to find an appropriate care setting.", "Finally, how intermediaries interact has important consequences in the health care market. For instance, employers and health insurers, which both intermediate on behalf of individuals, interact through negotiations over insurance benefits packages. Politicians can also act as intermediaries for their constituents by helping determine reimbursement rates for public insurance programs and by changing the regulatory environment facing health insurers.

In a simplified case, an insurance policy is characterized by the premiums charged, medical services covered, and cost sharing (deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments). The insurance premium equals the expected benefits the insurance company will pay out, which equals the average price of medical care multiplied by the average quantity of medical care provided, plus a loading fee to cover administrative expenses and profits. The loading fee acts as a \"price\" of insurance: other things equal, higher loading fees reduce demand for insurance coverage.", "The average price of medical care may depend on the complexity of services, the relative bargaining power of providers and insurers, and the cost structure of the providers. The average quantity depends on consumers' demand for health care, providers' willingness to supply care at prevailing prices, and managed care controls of the insurer. The size of the load factor depends on the insurers' administrative costs, costs of capital, and the ability of insurers to pass along higher premiums to employers and consumers. ", "In this simple example, providers gain when medical care prices are higher and when quantities are higher, so long as prices exceed their unit costs and so long as prices do not reduce demand too much. Consumers within a given plan benefit when quantities are higher (so long as the benefits of health care exceed out-of-pocket costs and non-monetary costs such as pain and inconvenience) and when prices are lower, so long as providers are willing to supply care.

Buyers of insurance may know more about individual health risk factors than the insurance company. Therefore, an insurer may be unable to distinguish a less healthy applicant, who derives a greater benefit from more generous insurance plans, from healthier applicants. Consequently, the insurance company could offer an insurance plan that would break even if it covered a representative sample of buyers in the market, but would bankrupt the insurer if it attracted a subset of the population with very high health care needs. This is known as adverse selection, a problem that could be especially severe in the individually purchased health insurance market. Adverse selection can force insurers to charge very high premiums, which then can drive healthier buyers out of the voluntary insurance market. Three decades of research suggest that adverse selection is quantitatively large. ", "Firms typically pay a large portion of the costs of employer-sponsored health insurance plans, which economic research suggests is passed along to employees via lower wages and salaries. Substantial tax advantages and employer cost-sharing of premiums supports high health plan participation, which allows the insurer to attract a group of individuals who are healthy enough to work and who participate in the plan for reasons other than buying health insurance. This reduces the extent of adverse selection, although it also makes employees less sensitive to health insurance costs. Firms' ability to self-insure, however, may raise other adverse selection issues.

This contrasts with risk-rated premiums where younger, healthier individuals are charged lower rates due to their lower expected claims. When premiums are not adjusted for individual characteristics and when consumers can opt in or out of insurance plans, risk pools can splinter, leading to an \"adverse selection death spiral.\" If the proportion of older, sicker individuals increases in the insurance pool, the rates charged will increase in response to the higher costs (claims). Some of the younger, healthier individuals will respond by dropping coverage (either dropping health coverage altogether or moving to a less expensive plan). This could cause costs to rise further, leading to higher rates and, consequently, more younger, healthier individuals dropping their coverage in the plan. In the extreme, only older, sicker individuals will be left in the plan. Studies have documented that an adverse selection death spiral can occur when an employer offers a choice of health insurance plans. Other researchers find that a common premium need not result in a death spiral.", "The splintering of health insurance pools into narrower risk categories in the small group and individual insurance markets has raised congressional concern about the availability and affordability of coverage for individuals who lack employer-sponsored health insurance coverage and who are ineligible for public insurance programs.

Conversely, insurers suffer losses due to adverse selection if uninsured individuals can enroll once they anticipate an adverse event. For this reason, some group health insurance plans have limited open enrollment seasons for large group insurance and impose preexisting conditions limits on individual or small-group insurance.

While the insurer may offer substantially the same services (apart from differences in risk-bearing) for both types of plans, profits as a percentage of revenues will generally be much lower for traditional commercial risk coverage than for ASO plans because those revenues include full premiums, not just administrative fees.

To industry analysts, the medical loss ratio reflects how well premiums are keeping up with increases in medical costs. To consumers, the medical loss ratio shows what proportion of premiums, on average, are returned through benefits. State insurance regulators typically monitor health insurers' medical loss ratios to ensure adequate benefits are paid out and that premiums do not rise much more quickly than claims expenses.

Medical loss ratios can differ by market segment. For instance, administrative costs are typically higher, and medical loss ratios are therefore generally lower, for individual plans than for large group plans. Medical loss ratios are typically higher when health insurers shift insurance risks to consumers through cost-sharing or to providers through capitation arrangements. The allocation of overhead costs, which is inherently arbitrary to some degree, will typically depend on accounting judgments, which may vary from insurer to insurer, although computation of medical loss ratios is generally constrained by some state regulators and by generally accepted accounting principles. While many insurance companies and some large employers use those data to track health plan performance, those data are typically considered proprietary. A more stringent limit on medical loss ratios might require careful attention to how those ratios are defined.", "In 2008, medical loss ratios among major insurers range from a low of 70.7% to almost 89%.

Such swings may be explained by aggressive pricing intended to increase market share or by unexpectedly high medical costs.", "Trends in medical loss ratios may also reflect changes in insurers' administrative costs. A major component of insurers' administrative costs is linked to processing of claims and running call centers, which are both closely linked to information technology.

In standard plans, firms pass on premiums from employees to insurers, who then pay claims.

The exchange could either select a limited number of plans judged to be more attractive or impose stricter requirements on plans. Some economists have found that consumers have difficulty choosing among plans when alternatives are numerous and when differences among plans are difficult to compare. Congress arguably acted as a gatekeeper by requiring standardization of Medigap policies in order to encourage more effective competition among insurers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Public Option", "paragraphs": ["Creation of a public option within the proposed Health Insurance Exchanges would have arguably been one way to expand health insurance coverage and control the growth of health insurance costs. The public option proposals responded to concerns about high levels of market concentration and the exercise of market power in health care markets, as well as to concerns about some industry practices in the individual and small-group market segments. Proponents of the public option argued that it would help limit costs in two ways. First, a public option plan could institute administrative efficiencies. Second, some argued that a public plan could negotiate better discounts with providers. ", "Government intervention in the market motivated by concerns about market concentration and the exercise of market power could have unintended consequences if the determinants of market structure are not well understood. The bargaining power of a public option could enhance economic efficiency by counteracting monopoly power exerted by providers, thus lowering prices and increasing output. But if providers are operating efficiently, then increased bargaining power by insurers could lead to economic inefficiency in the health care market. Evidence suggests, however, that many providers are not operating efficiently.", "Without further regulation, however, a public plan would have likely attracted high-cost individuals\u2014those who, because of health or age, can only buy insurance for very high premiums, or who are medically uninsurable because of pre-existing conditions. This adverse selection would have threatened the viability and stability of a public option. As an example, many states have high-risk health insurance pools (HRPs) to cover these high-cost individuals. But state HRPs typically charge premiums higher than premiums charged by private plans offered to healthier individuals and all operate at a loss. To avoid or mitigate adverse selection problems, most public option proposals mandated health insurance coverage by all, require community rating, and prohibit denial of insurance based on health or pre-existing conditions by private insurance plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cooperatives", "paragraphs": ["Some proposed creation of health insurance cooperatives as an alternative to a public plan. Cooperative health insurance policies would be available to eligible individuals through health insurance exchanges created by health insurance reform legislation. Proponents argued that cooperative-run plans would increase competition in the health insurance market without requiring more direct federal involvement. Others contended that cooperatives would be unable to improve performance of the health insurance industry.", "Some medical cooperatives were created in the 1930s, such as the Group Health Association in Washington, DC, and the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound. The AMA and local medical societies, however, vigorously opposed medical cooperatives and succeeded in driving many of them out of business. The Farm Security Administration (FSA) created several programs to provide medical care to low-income rural households, which included cooperatives that at their peak reached 600,000 people. Some historians argue the success of these cooperatives was limited by the lack of clear direction from FSA administrators and opposition from traditional farm groups. These programs were discontinued starting in 1946. The United Mine Workers' Welfare and Retirement Fund, created in the 1940s, might provide another model of a health cooperative.", "The early history of Blue Cross may be instructive. The Blue Cross idea, incorporated through a stream of new organizations, spread rapidly across the country during the 1930s and 1940s, demonstrating that a suitable design with support from existing organizations could transform the American health finance system. Blue Cross was able to piggyback on local hospitals and the AHA, and Blue Shield initially piggybacked on local medical societies. Links between hospitals and Blue Cross had profound effects on the governance and structure of Blue Cross. Though the modern health care sector is very different than when Blue Cross began, the strategy of linking new structures, such as cooperatives, to existing organizations could accelerate implementation. Those organizations would likely have a strong imprint on how proposed health insurance cooperatives were run.", "Blue Cross, in its earliest days, was originally strongly community oriented. This, in part, reflected the ideals of the \"voluntary hospital\" movement. Yet while charity and altruism have played important roles in the hospital industry, business-like behavior has also been prominent. By 1986, Congress concluded that Blue Cross organizations did not act much differently than commercial insurers.

Many large firms have reacted to market conditions by self-insuring, which may provide some competitive pressure on insurers, although this is unlikely to improve market conditions for other consumers. The exercise of market power by firms in concentrated markets generally leads to higher prices and reduced output\u2014high premiums and limited access to health insurance\u2014combined with high profits. Many other characteristics of the health insurance markets, however, also contribute to rising costs and limited access to affordable health insurance.", "Some evidence suggests that insurance companies' profits are not large, especially during the current economic recession; although some of those estimates exclude investment income. Even if health insurers were highly profitable, it is unclear how much reducing insurance industry profits would do to reduce total health care costs or even reduce administrative costs. Nor is it clear that more vigorous enforcement of antitrust laws and regulations would succeed in courts or would significantly reduce health insurance premiums or expanded health insurance coverage. ", "Health insurance is intertwined with the whole health care system. Health costs appear to have increased over time in large part because of complex interactions among health insurance, health care providers, employers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, tax policy, and the medical technology industry. Reducing the growth trajectory of health care costs may require policies that affect these interactions. Policies focused on health insurance sector reform may yield some results, but are unlikely to solve larger cost growth and problems of limited access\u00a0to health care if other parts of the health are left unchanged."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Additional Indicators of Health Insurers' Profitability", "paragraphs": ["This appendix presents two indicators of health insurer profitability for the period 2000-2008, and profits as a percentage of shareholder equity for Fortune 1000 firms by industry in 2008.

Return on equity measures a company's overall after-tax profitability from underwriting and investment activity, and is defined as the sum of after-tax net income and unrealized capital gains divided by equity. Return on equity provides a useful comparison to profits in other lines of business, but can be volatile, especially when accounting changes require adjustments of equity levels. Firms obtain capital through equity (typically through the sale of shares that entitle shareholders to dividend payments and certain voting rights) and debt (typically through loans or bonds that require fixed or specified interest payments). Firms can increase return on equity by increasing their debt-to-capital ratio, but at an increased risk of bankruptcy in the event of adverse business conditions that make interest payments to debt holders hard to sustain.", " Table A-2 presents return-on-revenue figures for major publicly traded health insurers over the period 2000-2008.
