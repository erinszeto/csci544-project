Many of the proposals introduced since 2001 are similar to those introduced during the early years of the Cold War, between 1946 and 1962. In each era, the measures attempted to address two or more of the following issues: the conditions under which the vacancies would be filled, the number or percentage of vacancies needed to invoke implementation of the measure, and the duration of the temporary appointments.", "This report will be updated as events warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Assuring Congressional Representation: Background", "paragraphs": ["The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, subsequent biological incidents, and natural threats such as hurricanes or pandemic illness, have motivated consideration of contingency planning options in the federal government and the private sector. Contingency planning incorporates a broad array of planning processes and preparedness capacities, including basic emergency preparedness and recovery plans leading to the resumption of normal operations of an organization.", "In Congress, contingency planning efforts include the consideration of options for the succession of congressional leadership, or for filling multiple vacancies in either chamber that might occur due to wide-scale death of Members or their absence from Congress due to injury or incapacitation. Concerns have been expressed that following an incident in which many Members of Congress are killed, incapacitated, or missing, a delay in seating new Members, or identifying sitting Members who might continue to serve, could adversely affect the ability of Congress to carry out its constitutional responsibilities. Some efforts to incorporate Member replacement activities into legislative branch emergency preparedness planning may raise constitutional issues.", "Prior to the September 2001 attacks, congressional practice regarding disruptions of membership in either chamber was dependent on the type of disruption. The confirmed death of an individual Member in either chamber creates an automatic vacancy which could be filled under existing procedures. In the House, the existence of a vacancy is communicated to the appropriate state, and a special election to fill the seat is held pursuant to state law. The laws of most states authorize governors to make temporary appointments to the Senate, with some exceptions. Where procedures regarding the death of a Member of Congress are well established, matters related to the capacity or availability of a Member to serve have been addressed by the House and Senate only on a case by case basis. In instances of death or incapacitation, congressional practices appear to assume a membership disruption of one Member at a time, and do not address the potential implications of mass congressional casualties, or the perceived need to quickly reconvene Congress after an incident so it can continue to carry out its constitutional responsibilities.", "While issues related to Members who are missing or incapacitated affect both chambers, concerns related to mass vacancies in membership appear to fall more heavily on the House, due to the requirement that its Members be selected only by election. As a consequence, questions have been raised about the ability of the House to meet constitutionally mandated quorum requirements to conduct business after an incident in which many Members may have been killed or injured, or go missing. In response, during the 109 th Congress (2005-2006), the House adopted rules to establish a provisional quorum after catastrophic circumstances, formally codifying longstanding House practice that a quorum is a majority of the Members elected, sworn, and living. In practice, the Speaker or Speaker pro tempore now typically announces a revised whole number of the House in light of changes in the membership of the House, but the question of whether a provisional quorum is constitutional has not been addressed.", "In addition to rules changes, during the 109 th Congress, legislation was enacted to require states to hold special House elections when extraordinary circumstances cause mass vacancies in the House. The act provides that extraordinary circumstances exist following an announcement by the Speaker of the House that vacancies in the chamber have exceeded 100 seats. States in which a vacancy exists in its House representation are then required to hold a special election within 49 days, subject to some exceptions. States are required to (1) make a determination of the candidates who will run in the special election not later than 10 days after the vacancy announcement by the political parties authorized by state law to nominate candidates, or by any other method the state considers appropriate; (2) ensure to the greatest extent practicable that absentee ballots for the election are transmitted to absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters not later than 15 days after the Speaker announces that the vacancy exists; and (3) accept and process any otherwise valid ballot or other election material from an absent uniformed services voter or an overseas voter, as long as the ballot or other material is received by the appropriate state election official not later than 45 days after the state transmits the ballot to the voter.", "Those who support the adjustment of the quorum and the enactment of law to require special elections in extraordinary circumstances believe those provisions afford the House sufficient institutional protections. Some critics argue that those actions are insufficient. The critics argue that holding special elections to seat new Representatives up to seven weeks after an announcement of extraordinary circumstances could deprive the nation of a functional, broadly representative legislative response at a time of great national challenge. Others raise what they believe to be constitutional concerns related to provisional quorum rules.", "Those who oppose current House practices regarding provisional quorum procedures argue that, contrary to longstanding House practice, quorum requirements are based on the number of seats in either chamber, and not on the number of Members present to conduct business. Article I, Section 5, Clause 1 of the Constitution states, in part, that \" ... a majority of each [chamber] shall constitute a Quorum to do Business ... ,\" but does not specify whether the majority is based on Members or the number of seats authorized for the chamber. Observers raising constitutional concerns believe that if more than half of the 435 seats in the House, or the 100 seats in the Senate, were vacant because the Members who held them were killed, or those members were unable to serve because they were incapacitated or missing in the aftermath of an incident, any actions taken by fewer than a majority of the remaining Members in either chamber could be seen as potentially illegitimate, and arguably unconstitutional.", "Actions in the House have attempted to enable the chamber to withstand a range of interruptions that could kill or incapacitate large numbers of Members, while supporting the principle that membership in the chamber is gained only through election by the people. In the Senate, most vacant seats could be replenished in a relatively brief period through appointments (assuming state-based authorities were available to make such appointments), but similar questions may arise if a sufficient number of Senators survive but are incapacitated, or if their whereabouts are unknown, and the Senate cannot meet with a quorum to do business. As a consequence, some observers argue that the policies adopted or enacted since 2001 may not provide adequate protection against a sudden loss of membership in either chamber, and may raise constitutional and implementation concerns. They believe that these concerns can only be remedied by amending the Constitution to allow for the rapid replenishment of vacant seats in the event of a significant loss of membership in either chamber.", "Several proposed constitutional amendments to address the consequences of catastrophic losses of congressional membership have been introduced since the 2001 attacks. During another period of uncertainty, 1946 to 1962, similar measures were proposed. In current times, the perceived need for such measures is based on the possibility that terrorists could target Congress itself, or the Washington, DC, region. Earlier, the emergence of the Cold War between the United States and its allies and the Soviet Union and its allies, the successful testing of an atomic bomb by the Soviets in September 1949, and subsequent claims that it might be stockpiling atomic weapons, brought considerable interest to the issue of filling congressional vacancies in the event of a national emergency among some Members of Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Continuity of Congress-Related Constitutional Amendments, 2001-2009", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "111th Congress", "paragraphs": ["On May 20, 2009, Representative Brian Baird introduced H.J.Res. 52 , proposing an amendment to the Constitution to temporarily fill mass vacancies in the House and the Senate.

Upon written declaration to the Speaker or President pro tempore, as appropriate, that an inability did not exist, the Member would immediately resume the powers and duties of their office. The measure provided that states could authorize by law the appointment of an acting Senator in the absence of a qualified alternate when there was a vacancy in the office of Senator. Alternates would be required to meet the qualifications of Representative or Senator, as appropriate, and each chamber could punish its alternates for disorderly behavior, or expel them with the concurrence of two-thirds of its Members. If the House or Senate were unable to establish a quorum for three days or more, the measure would permit either chamber to declare Members who had not recorded their presence to be unable to discharge the powers and duties of their offices.

The measures also stipulated that this procedure would go into effect only if a majority of the House or Senate were unable to perform their duties.

Governors would then make temporary appointments until elections could be held. The notification process raised a number of questions related to the definition of terms and the establishment of procedures.

To address those concerns, later measures would have authorized governors to make temporary appointments to the House when vacancies in the House exceeded half of the authorized membership.

From their perspective, establishing provisions for an expedited response before an incident occurs could also demonstrate the country's determination to continue a representative form of government, consonant with their interpretation of the constitutional requirements of a quorum in both chambers, even in extraordinary times.

In addition, they might point out that if such an automatic Member replenishment process were ever to be invoked, it could create two classes of Members: those who became Members through the crucible of the electoral process, and those who were part of a cohort that was appointed. A sudden shift in membership in either chamber could result in a change in the legislative agenda, or majority control, although the circumstance necessitating the use of temporary members would arguably determine the nature of work a newly replenished Congress might consider.

On the other hand, the lack of state support, or the challenges of acquiring or improvising a WMD, and then delivering it to a target that affects significant numbers of Members of Congress, might prove beyond the capacity of a terrorist adversary. At the same time, some observers argue that the United States Capitol and Congress have been targeted in the past, and that they continue to be targets of high social, political, and symbolic significance.", "If Congress believes that no action is needed to ensure the continuity of congressional representation, it might continue the status quo.
