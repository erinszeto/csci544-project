The end of U.S. combat in Iraq and the declining tempo of operations in Afghanistan accounted for the bulk of the overall reduction: The budget request for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO)\u2014DOD activities in those two countries\u2014was $88.5 billion, which is $26.6 billion less than was provided for those operations in FY2012.", "However, the Administration's $525.4 billion request for DOD's so-called \"base budget\"\u2014funds for all DOD activities other than OCO\u2014was $5.2 billion less than was provided for FY2012 and $45.3 billion less than the FY2013 base budget the Administration had projected a year earlier, in February of 2011. The proposed reduction in the base budget\u2014and planned reductions of more than $50 billion per year through FY2021, compared with the FY2011 projection\u2014reflected the Administration's effort to reduce federal spending as required by the Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011, enacted on August 2, 2011 (P.L. 112-25). All told, the Obama Administration's February 2012 projection would reduce DOD budgets by $486.9 billion over a 10-year period (FY2012-FY2021), compared with its February 2011 plan. (See \"", "FY2013 Defense Budget Overview.\")", "According to the Administration, the FY2013 DOD budget request was consistent with the initial spending caps set by the BCA. However, both H.R. 4310, the version of the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) passed by the House on May 18, 2012, and H.R. 5856, the companion DOD appropriations bill for FY2013, reported by the House Appropriations Committee on May 25, 2012, exceeded the Administration request for those bills \u2014by $3.7 billion in the case of the authorization bill and by $3.1 billion in the case of the appropriation bill.", "On the other hand, S. 3254, the version of the NDAA reported June 4, 2012, by the Senate Armed Services Committee, and the version of the DOD appropriations bill (H.R. 5856) reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee on August 2, 2012, kept FY2013 DOD funding within the initial BCA caps.", "Neither the House nor the Senate considered either an NDAA or a DOD appropriations bill for FY2013 that conformed to the lowered BCA caps on defense spending.", "The compromise version of the authorization bill (H.R. 4310), enacted on January 2, 2013 as P.L. 112-239, would authorize $544.9 billion for DOD's base budget\u2014roughly splitting the difference between the House and Senate bills\u2014and would authorize $88.5 billion for war costs.", "In general terms, the House-passed and Senate committee-reported versions of the first DOD appropriations bill for FY2013 (H.R. 5856) paralleled the House and Senate versions of the FY2013 NDAA, respectively. However, the Senate did not act on that bill. For nearly the first six months of FY2013, DOD and other federal agencies had been funded by a continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 117; P.L. 112-175). On March 21, 2013, Congress sent to the White House H.R. 933, the Consolidated and Continuing Appropriations Act, which the President signed into law (P.L. 113-6) on March 26, 2013. Division C of that legislation is the Department of Defense Appropriations bill for FY2013 (See \"DOD Appropriations Overview\"). Although the amount provided by that section of the bill was $287.4 million more than the Administration's request for programs covered by that division of H.R. 933, the overall level of DOD funding provided by H.R. 933 (including funds provided for military construction in Division E) exceeded the request by $323.8 million.", "Since the total DOD funding level for FY2013 of $607.7 billion exceeds the BCA spending cap, that law requires that DOD funds be reduced (or \"sequestered) by $35.0 billion before the end of the fiscal year. As of May 15, 2013, the Administration has not allocated the required reduction among specific DOD programs.

Most of that decline reflected the decrease in OCO spending for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, while the decline in war costs accounted for most of this reduction, the President's FY2013 request also would have reduced the base budget (in current dollars) for the first time since 1996. The base budget request was $5.2 billion less than was appropriated for the base budget in FY2012 and $45.3 billion less than the FY2013 request the Administration had projected in February 2011 ( Figure 1 ).", "That reduction from the previously planned FY2013 request\u2014and additional planned reductions of more than $50 billion per year compared to DOD's February 2011 budget projections through FY2021\u2014reflected the Administration's plan to reduce federal spending as required by the Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011, enacted on August 2, 2011 ( P.L. 112-25 ). Compared with the long-range spending plan published by DOD in February 2011, the February 2012 plan reduced DOD base budgets by $259.4 billion from FY2012 through FY2017 ( Figure 2 ). For the 10-year period covered by the BCA (FY2012-FY2021), the Administration's revised spending plan reduced DOD budgets by a total of $486.9 billion.", "Further reductions in DOD base budgets over the next 10 years may be in store as a result of the BCA. In addition to the $900 billion worth of deficit reduction in FY2012-FY2021 (counting both defense and non-defense spending) that results from the BCA, the act also requires additional deficit reduction measures totaling $1.2 trillion through FY2021 (which would result in a total deficit reduction through FY2021 of $2.1 trillion).", "In FY2013, the BCA requires an across the board cut in budget authority (or \"sequester\") that would be levied against almost all discretionary spending. For the National Defense budget function (of which the DOD budget comprises more than 95%), some $59 billion\u2014about 10%\u2014would be cut from the Administration's budget request, with equal percentages cut from each program, project and activity. In subsequent years, the BCA sets lowered spending caps to achieve the required savings. Each year, to the extent that Congress appropriates more than the caps allow, the Administration would sequester funds through across-the-board cuts to ensure that the required savings are achieved. If the sequestration process and the lowered spending caps remain law, the Administration's February 2012 projection for defense budgets over the next 10 years would be cut by an additional $515 billion\u2014about 9%."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Base Budget Highlights", "paragraphs": ["The Obama Administration presented its FY2013 DOD budget plan both as an effort to address the long-term spending limits set by the BCA and as an opportunity to refocus U.S. defense planning as DOD winds down large-scale deployments of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.

For example, the Administration planned to withdraw and disband two of the four Army brigade combat teams currently stationed in Germany while maintaining a rotating force of up to 2,500 Marines in northern Australia. It also planned to station littoral combat ships in Singapore and smaller patrol craft in Bahrain. Because of the distances from land bases to which U.S. forces have access, operations in the Asia-Pacific region would rely heavily on air and naval forces. Accordingly, many observers expect a shift of DOD resources toward naval and air forces at the expense of ground formations.", "Some question the Administration's claim of a \"pivot\" toward Asia, citing its plan to retire some older, long-range cargo planes and to cut a total of $13.1 billion from projected shipbuilding budgets for FY2013-FY2017.
