The level and extent of federal funding for these activities is an ongoing and controversial issue in U.S. foreign assistance and has continued to be a point of contention during the 115th Congress.", "These issues have been debated for over four decades in the context of a broader domestic abortion controversy that began with the Supreme Court's 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade, which holds that the Constitution protects a woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy. Since Roe, Congress has enacted foreign assistance legislation placing restrictions or requirements on the federal funding of abortions and on family planning activities abroad. Many of these provisions, often referred to by the name of the lawmakers that introduced them, have been included in foreign aid authorizations, appropriations, or both, and affect different types of foreign assistance. Examples include", "the \"Helms amendment,\" which prohibits the use of U.S. funds to perform abortions or to coerce individuals to practice abortions; the \"Biden amendment,\" which states that U.S. funds may not be used for biomedical research related to abortion or involuntary sterilization; the \"Siljander amendment,\" which prohibits U.S. funds from being used to lobby for or against abortion; the \"Kemp-Kasten amendment,\" which prohibits funding for any organization or program that, as determined by the President, supports or participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization (the Trump Administration has withheld funding from UNFPA under this law); and the \"Tiahrt amendment,\" which places requirements on voluntary family planning projects receiving assistance from USAID.", "The executive branch has also engaged in the debate over international abortion and family planning. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan issued what has become known as the \"Mexico City policy,\" which required foreign nongovernmental organizations receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify that they would not perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning, even if such activities were conducted with non-U.S. funds. The policy was rescinded by President Bill Clinton and reinstituted and expanded by President George W. Bush to include State Department activities. In January 2009, President Barack Obama rescinded the policy. It was reinstated and expanded by President Trump in January 2017, and renamed \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" (PLGHA).", "This report focuses primarily on legislative restrictions and executive branch policies related to international abortion and family planning.

For many, the debate focuses on three key questions:", "Do countries or organizations that receive U.S. assistance perform abortions or engage in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization activities with U.S. funds? Should U.S. funding be permitted or withheld from countries or organizations that participate in these activities? What impact, if any, might the withholding of U.S. funds have on population growth, family planning, and reproductive health services in developing countries? ", "Members of Congress have engaged in heated debates regarding these issues in connection with a broader domestic controversy regarding U.S. abortion policy. These debates have continued since the Supreme Court's 1973 landmark ruling in Roe v. Wade , which holds that the Constitution protects a woman's decision whether to terminate her pregnancy. In nearly every Congress since Roe , Members who oppose abortion have introduced legislation that would prohibit the practice in the United States. Many congressional opponents have also sought to attach provisions to annual appropriations measures banning the use of federal funds to perform abortions. ", "Before the Roe decision, the majority of discussions in Congress regarding the federal funding of abortion focused on domestic authorization and appropriations legislation, particularly labor and health and human services appropriations. After Roe , however, the controversy spread to U.S. foreign assistance, leading to the enactment of abortion and voluntary family planning restrictions in foreign assistance authorizations and appropriations. ", "Debate over international abortion restrictions has also reached the executive branch. In 1984, President Reagan issued what has become known as the \"Mexico City policy,\" which required foreign nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) receiving U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) family planning assistance to certify that they would not perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning, even if such activities were undertaken with non-U.S. funds. In the intervening years, the Mexico City policy has been rescinded and reissued by various Administrations. Most recently, it was rescinded by President Barack Obama in January 2009 and reinstated and expanded by President Donald Trump on January 23, 2017.", "During the 115 th Congress, Members have continued to debate prohibitions and restrictions on abortion and family planning activities abroad. As in prior appropriations cycles, some Members sought to renew, add, modify, or remove language addressing these issues in State-Foreign Operations legislation. In addition, some introduced legislation aiming to make the Mexico City policy (also referred to as \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance,\" or PLGHA), or its reversal, permanent law. Federal funding for abortion and family planning activities remains a controversial issue in foreign assistance, and congressional interest in the subject is likely to continue into the next congressional session. ", "This report examines key legislative and executive branch policies that restrict or place requirements on U.S. funding of abortion or voluntary family planning activities abroad.

", "Legislation that authorizes foreign aid establishes, continues, or modifies an agency or program for a fixed or indefinite period of time. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA), as amended, is the cornerstone of permanent foreign aid authorization law. The FAA is divided into several \"parts\" that authorize different types of foreign assistance, including development assistance (part I); military and security assistance (part II); general, administrative, and miscellaneous provisions (part III); the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative (part IV); and debt reduction for developing countries with tropical forests (part V). Congress has routinely amended the FAA since 1961 and has authorized new programs in stand-alone acts, but it has not comprehensively reauthorized most programs in the FAA since 1985. Subsequent authorization bills have often stalled in the face of debates and disagreements on controversial issues (including abortion and family planning), a tight legislative calendar, or foreign policy disputes between Congress and the executive branch. ", "In the absence of the regular enactment of foreign aid authorizations, Congress has annually considered appropriations measures that set spending levels for nearly every foreign assistance account. In recent years, these measures have become increasingly significant for Congress in influencing how U.S. foreign aid is disbursed. Many of them have included family planning or abortion-related restrictions or requirements. ", "The links among the various requirements and restrictions, as well as their inclusion in different legislation, are complex and in some cases not immediately apparent. For example, some amendments that were already enacted in the FAA, such as the Helms and Biden provisions, appear to be added to other foreign assistance-related legislation for emphasis. In other cases, the provisions may have been added so that they apply to additional categories of foreign aid not covered under the FAA. Moreover, some restrictions and requirements stand on their own, while others seek to clarify and amend other existing restrictions. The Leahy amendment, for instance, defines the term \"motivate\" as written in the Helms amendment, while the Livingston amendment seeks to clarify prohibitions in the DeConcini amendment.
