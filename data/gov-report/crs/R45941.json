After a sequester order is issued, Medicare payments are sequestered beginning on the first day of the following month and remain in effect during the following one-year period, even if there is an intervening sequester order. The total amount sequestered from Medicare depends on actual Medicare spending in a given year rather than an amount based on OMB's estimate.

Under section 251A(3)(B), the remaining $0.842 billion is the reduction required for budget accounts with direct spending.", "The implementation of the reductions involves the following steps:", "Step 3 . As required by section 251A(5)(B), the discretionary spending limit for the defense category is lowered by the amount calculated in step 2, which results in a discretionary defense cap for FY 2020 of $576.175 billion.", "Step 4 . As required by section 251A(6), the percentage reduction for nonexempt direct spending is calculated by dividing the direct spending reduction amount ($0.842 billion) by the sequestrable budgetary resources ($9.844 billion) for budget accounts with direct spending, which yields a 8.6 percent sequestration for budget accounts with nonexempt direct spending.", "Nondefense Function Reduction", "Steps 1 and 2 on Table D-3 show the calculation of the reduction required for discretionary appropriations and direct spending within all other functions besides 050 (nondefense function). The calculation is more complicated than the calculation for the defense function due to a two percent limit in the reduction of Medicare non-administrative spending and a special rule for applying the reduction to student loans. Steps 3 and 4 on Table D-3 reflect the implementation of the reductions calculated in steps 1 and 2 through an adjustment to the discretionary spending limit for the nondefense category and a sequestration of direct spending in the nondefense function. ", "The calculation of the reduction involves the following steps:", "Step 1 . Total spending in the nondefense function must be reduced by $54.667 billion. The portion of Medicare subject to the two percent limit is estimated to have combined FY 2020 and FY 2021 outlays of $765.495 billion from FY 2020 budgetary resources, so a two percentage point reduction would reduce outlays by $15.310 billion, leaving a reduction of $39.357 billion to be taken from discretionary appropriations and other direct spending in the nondefense function.", "Step 2 . Pursuant to section 251A(4), the remaining reduction of $39.357 billion is allocated proportionately between discretionary appropriations and other direct spending in the nondefense function. The base ($653.518 billion) is the sum of the FY 2020 discretionary spending limit for the nondefense category ($578.000 billion) and the remaining sequestrable direct spending base ($75.518 billion). The latter amount equals OMB's 2020 Budget baseline estimates of total sequestrable direct spending outlays in the nondefense function in FY 2020 and FY 2021 from direct spending sequestrable resources in FY 2020 ($841.013 billion) minus the portion of Medicare subject to the two percent limit ($765.495 billion). Discretionary appropriations account for 88.44 percent of the remaining base in the nondefense function, and direct spending accounts for 11.56 percent.", "As required by section 251A(4), applying these percentage allocations to the remaining required reduction for programs in the nondefense function yields the reduction for discretionary appropriations ($34.807 billion) and for remaining direct spending ($4.550 billion).", "The implementation of the reductions involves the following steps:", "Step 3 . As required by section 251A(5)(B), the discretionary spending limit for the nondefense category is lowered by the amount calculated in step 2, which results in a discretionary nondefense cap for FY2020 of $543.193 billion.", "Step 4 . The remaining reduction ($4.550 billion) to direct spending is applied as a uniform percentage reduction to the remaining budget accounts with sequestrable direct spending and by increasing student loan fees by the same uniform percentage, as specified in sections 251A(6) and 256(b). Each percentage point increase in the sequestration rate is estimated to result in $0.010 billion of savings in the direct student loan program. Solving simultaneously for the percentage that would achieve the remaining reduction when applied to both the remaining sequestrable direct spending ($75.518 billion) and to student loan fees yields a 5.9 percent reduction. This percentage reduction yields outlay savings of $0.059 billion in the direct student loan program and $4.491 billion from the remaining budget accounts with nonexempt direct spending.", "Appendix E.
