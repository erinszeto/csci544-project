The farm bill required USDA to propose rules to implement these provisions.", "On June 22, 2010, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) published a proposed rule to implement regulations (9 C.F.R. 201) on livestock and poultry marketing practices as mandated by the 2008 farm bill. The proposed rule, commonly referred to as the \"GIPSA rule,\" added new regulations to clarify conduct that violates the P&S Act. The P&S Act regulations are used by USDA to ensure fair competition in livestock and poultry markets.", "In what some saw as a major change from current practice, GIPSA proposed that a violation of the P&S Act does not require a finding of \"harm or likely harm to competition.\" The proposed rule set criteria for \"unfair, discriminatory, and deceptive practices\" and \"undue or unreasonable preference or advantages\" that violate the P&S Act. The proposed rule also included arbitration provisions to ensure that contract growers have a meaningful opportunity to participate in arbitration and the right to decline arbitration.", "According to proponents of the proposed rule implementing the farm bill provisions, the rule brought fairness to contracts and reshaped interactions between producers and large meat packers and poultry processors. Opponents argued that the proposed rule went far beyond the intent of Congress in the 2008 farm bill, and that the rule altered business practices to the detriment of producers, consumers, and the industries.", "USDA issued a final rule on December 9, 2011, which went into effect on February 7, 2012. The final rule, a significant modification of the proposed rule, included four provisions that address, respectively, suspension of the delivery of birds, additional capital investments, remedy of breach of contract, and arbitration.", "In November 2011, before USDA finalized the GIPSA rule, Congress passed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 (P.L. 112-55), which prohibited USDA from finalizing or implementing the most contentious parts of the rule. Congress continued to enact such appropriations riders in FY2013, FY2014, and FY2015.", "In addition, the FY2013 and FY2015 appropriations acts included language to rescind three provisions that USDA had finalized in 2011. These were the definition of the \"suspension of delivery of birds,\" the 90-day notification period required when a poultry company intends to suspend the delivery of birds to a grower, and the provision that made the rule applicable to live poultry. In February 2015, USDA removed the three provisions from its regulations.", "For the first time in four years, the enacted Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) did not include a GIPSA rider prohibiting USDA from finalizing and implementing rules on livestock and poultry marketing.", "Also, the GIPSA rules were addressed during the debate over the 2014 farm bill. Section 12102 of the House-passed 2013 farm bill (H.R. 2642) permanently prohibited USDA from finalizing or implementing GIPSA provisions that have been temporarily halted in appropriations acts. The Senate-passed farm bill (S. 954) did not contain a similar provision.

On November 3, 2011, after nearly a year of review, USDA notified stakeholders that a final rule and an interim final rule on livestock and poultry marketing practices had been sent to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for final review.", "USDA indicated that the final rule would contain provisions covering the suspension of delivery of birds, additional capital investment, breach of contract, and arbitration\u2014four provisions addressed in Sections 11005 and 11006 of the 2008 farm bill. Also, USDA said the final rule would contain a section on swine and poultry contracts. Importantly, USDA also indicated that it would not go forward with proposed and controversial provisions that banned packer-to-packer sales and limited the relationship between packers and packer buyers. USDA also dropped the requirement that written records providing justification for pricing differentials be maintained.", "However, on November 18, 2011, the FY2012 Agriculture Appropriations Act ( P.L. 112-55 ) was enacted and included a general provision that limited USDA's ability to finalize a large portion of its proposed rule. Section 721 of the act placed specific conditions and prohibitions on which parts of the proposed rule USDA could finalize. It required that the combined annual cost to the economy from a final rule or an interim final rule must be less than $100 million. Section 721\u00a0also prohibited USDA from using any funds to implement eight specific provisions of the proposed rule, regardless of the annual cost to the economy of the final or interim final\u00a0rule.

It included four provisions from the proposed rule, addressing suspension of the delivery of birds, additional capital investment, remedy of breach of contract, and arbitration. However, it did not include many of the most contentious provisions, either because of congressional prohibitions enacted in P.L. 112-55 or because USDA decided not to pursue some provisions at this time.", "For more information on USDA and congressional actions affecting the proposed rule, see \" Congressional Limits in FY2012 Appropriations ,\" and \" USDA's Final Rule ,\" below."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) is the USDA agency that promulgates regulations under the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 (P&S Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7181 et seq.; see box, \"The Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921\") to oversee livestock and poultry markets. GIPSA is responsible for monitoring, reviewing, and investigating livestock and poultry markets to promote fair competition; providing payment protection through bonding and packer trusts, and guarding against deceptive and fraudulent trade practices.", "Some farmers and ranchers and their advocate groups believe that as the meat and poultry industries have become increasingly concentrated over time, competition has eroded, and producers have little say in market transactions with large meat companies. In addition, some claim USDA has not used the P&S Act sufficiently to protect livestock and poultry producers, especially small producers, from perceived unfair trade practices of large meat companies.", "During 2010, in order to address ongoing concerns about competition in the livestock and poultry industries, USDA and the Department of Justice (DOJ) jointly held five workshops to discuss competition and regulatory issues in agriculture. The five workshops covered farming, poultry, dairy, livestock, and margins (the difference between the price producers receive and the price consumers pay). These workshops provided an opportunity for stakeholders from various sectors of the meat and poultry industries to air their concerns.", "USDA issued a proposed GIPSA rule on livestock and poultry marketing practices in mid-2010. Proponents and opponents espoused widely differing interpretations of it. According to USDA and supporters of the proposed rule, the regulations allowed for more effective and efficient enforcement of the P&S Act. According to USDA, the interaction between meat companies would be more transparent, as the proposed rule required meat packers and poultry processors to justify pricing differences and provide sample contracts to GIPSA. The proposed rule defined and gave examples of practices that GIPSA considered unfair that would violate the P&S Act. The proposed rule would bring fairness to marketing transactions, according to supporters.", "Opponents of the proposed rule claimed that there would be unintended consequences that would adversely affect normal livestock and poultry marketing practices. They argued that the proposed rule amounted to the government stepping in to manage the day-to-day working of markets, which would lead to inefficiencies, increased litigation, and the loss of gains that the industry has experienced over the years.", "The proposed rule was issued with a 60-day comment period. After considerable comment and feedback, the comment period was extended for an additional 90 days ending November 22, 2010. The proposed rule generated more than 61,000 public comments.", "Some Members of Congress expressed considerable interest in the GIPSA rule throughout the comment period, and during the 112 th Congress there has been considerable interest in overseeing USDA's implementation of the final rule.

Others argue that this consolidation occurred in previous decades and has stabilized in recent years, bringing with it efficiencies that benefit producers and consumers alike. Furthermore, barring collusion, others argue that it only takes two interested buyers to have sufficient competition for a market to work properly."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Industry Consolidation", "paragraphs": ["Market concentration in the meat and poultry industries has increased over the last two decades, with a few firms now dominating each sector. The \"four-firm concentration ratio\" measures the four largest firms' share of the market and is commonly cited as a summary indicator of concentration and overall structural change in the industry. The historical evolution of industry concentration ratios for the slaughter of fed cattle (steers and heifers), hogs, and poultry is shown in Figure 1 below. From 1986 to 2008, the four-firm share of slaughter increased from 55% to 79% for cattle, 33% to 65% for hogs, and 34% to 57% for poultry. The concentration ratios appear to have stabilized in the mid-1990s for the cattle sector, around 2003 for the hog sector, and since about 2006 for the poultry sector.", "Recent estimates of the various marketing strategies employed by the three major livestock species are displayed in Table 1 . Some in the industry are concerned that the share of cash transactions is not sufficient to adequately determine cash prices, which is critical because the cash market is often used as input for contracts or other marketing arrangements. The cash market still comprises a relatively large share (estimated at 41% in 2008) of fed cattle sales. The hog sector's cash market share of sales has been declining over the past several decades and now stands at less than 10% of all sales. However, the hog cash market is still fairly robust and provides the basis for much of the formula and forward contract pricing. In the poultry sector, cash sales of broilers are essentially nonexistent, with production contracts accounting for nearly all transactions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legal Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Previously, producers initiated several closely watched lawsuits under the P&S Act challenging the contracting and marketing practices of large meat and poultry companies.

Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc. \u2014a group of cattle feeders in 1996 sued Iowa Beef Packers (IBP), which was bought by Tyson in 2001, for violating the P&S Act. This was reportedly the first class action certified for producers against a packer in the P&S Act's long history. Following eight years of litigation, a jury in early 2004 agreed with producer arguments that the packer had used \"captive supplies\" to control the supply of cattle available on the market, thereby causing lower cattle prices. The jury set damages at more than $1.2 billion. However, the federal judge in the case set aside the verdict on the grounds that the jury had insufficient evidence to find that Tyson had no legitimate business reason for using captive supplies.", "The plaintiffs appealed, but a U.S. Court of Appeals in August 2005 upheld the lower judge's decision. The appeals court rejected the plaintiffs' argument that there was a violation of the P&S Act. \"If a packer's course of business promotes efficiency and aids competition in the cattle market, the challenged practice cannot, by definition, adversely affect competition,\" the court declared. The plaintiffs and their supporters asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case, but the Court declined to do so in early 2006.", "In a more recent example, in January 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the case, Terry v. Tyson Farms, Inc. , brought by a Tennessee poultry grower against Tyson Farms. Terry sued Tyson in federal court in 2008 claiming unfair practices under the P&S Act because Tyson would not allow him to view the weighing of his birds when they were delivered to the plant.

An agriculture competition title was included in an early version of the farm bill ( S. 1628 ) but was removed in the Senate Agriculture Committee markup. During subsequent floor action on the bill, the Senate approved some individual competition amendments that were enacted in the final 2002 farm bill. One gave producers the right to discuss their contracts with family members and advisors, and the other extended new P&S Act protections to swine producers with production contracts (Sections 10502 and 10503 of P.L. 107-171 ).", "In February 2007, ahead of deliberations on the 2008 farm bill in the 110 th Congress, Senator Harkin introduced the Competitive and Fair Agricultural Markets Act of 2007 ( S. 622 ) to clarify and strengthen the P&S Act and the Agricultural Fair Practices Act of 1967 (7 U.S.C. \u00a72301 et seq.).

The bill also would have set up production contract and enforcement provisions. Parts of S. 622 were incorporated into the Senate-passed version ( S. 2302 ) of the farm bill, which contained a new title on Livestock, Marketing, Regulatory, and Related Programs (Title X). The Senate version of the farm bill also contained a provision to ban packer ownership of cattle.

The enacted farm bill requires that contracts clearly disclose the right of a producer or grower to decline the arbitration provision. The law also provides that producers and growers could opt for arbitration even after declining the arbitration provision at the time of contract execution, if both sides agree in writing to take a dispute to an arbitrator.

The farm bill specifically directed the Secretary of Agriculture to establish criteria in four areas: first, criteria to determine if producers or growers are treated with undue or unreasonable preference or advantage; second, criteria to determine whether poultry dealers give enough notice to poultry growers before suspending the delivery of birds; third, criteria to determine if required additional capital investments during a poultry or swine contract were a violation of the P&S Act; and fourth, criteria to determine if poultry growers or swine producers are given enough time to remedy a breach of contract before contracts are terminated.

The proposed rule addressed the poultry grower and swine producer contract provisions in the 2008 farm bill and also included regulations that prohibit what USDA has deemed unfair market practices. The proposed rule introduced new requirements for contracts and market practices with the aim of creating a fairer, transparent market for livestock and poultry producers.

The second involve undue or unreasonable preferences. The other unlawful actions under Section 202 include conduct where packers, swine contractors, or poultry dealers apportion supply, control prices, or create monopolies that restrain commerce (harm to competition), or aid and abet in these actions. Sections 201.2 and 201.3 of the proposed rule specifically addressed the first two unlawful acts of Section 202 of the P&S Act.", "When courts have heard P&S Act cases, the rulings usually have required that plaintiffs prove that the conduct of meat packers or poultry processors has harmed competition. Proponents of the proposed rule claimed that it is nearly impossible for an individual grower or producer to prove a broad charge of harm to competition.", "In Section 201.2 of the proposed rule, GIPSA defined competitive injury as any action that distorts competition in the marketplace. GIPSA defined likelihood of competitive injury as any reasonable basis that competitive injury will occur. This could be conduct by packers, contractors, or poultry dealers that raises costs for competitors or misuses market power to distort competition with rivals. In addition, the proposed rule extended the definition of likelihood of competitive injury to conduct by packers, contractors, and poultry dealers directed toward livestock producers and poultry growers. Conduct that depresses prices to producers and growers or prevents producers and growers from competing with other producers or growers can be a competitive injury or harm to competition.

Sample criteria included whether or not a poultry grower or swine producer has the discretion to decide against making the investment, whether or not they are coerced into making the investment, and whether or not other similar growers or producers are required to make additional capital investments. Also, it could be considered a violation of the P&S Act if a poultry or swine contractor plans to substantially reduce or shut slaughter or processing facilities within 12 months of requiring additional capital investments. But contractors could get a waiver from that regulation for catastrophic or natural disasters, or other emergencies. If additional capital investments were required, the grower or producer would have to be given a contract of sufficient length to allow them to recoup 80% of the cost of the investment.", "Section 201.218 of the proposed rule set criteria to determine if a contract grower or producer has been given sufficient opportunity to remedy a breach of contract. The proposed rule required that a written notice be given to the contract grower or producer and that the notification identify the breach, when it occurred, and how it can be remedied. Growers and producers would also have the chance to rebut a breach of contract claim. Contractors would also consider the welfare of the animals that growers or producers are responsible for when considering actions and timelines for remedying a breach of contract.", "Last, USDA proposed in Section 201.212(c) that packer-to-packer sales of livestock be banned. This would include affiliated companies and wholly-owned subsidiaries. A packer could receive a waiver for catastrophic or natural disasters.

Section 201.94 required that packers, swine contractors, and live poultry dealers keep written records to justify differential pricing. The justification would have to provide the cost-benefit basis for different prices. GIPSA noted in its rule discussion that participation in a branded product program could be justification for a packer paying premium prices to cattle producers. Section 201.214 prohibited discounting base pay by live poultry dealers who use the tournament system to pay poultry growers. In a tournament system a poultry grower's birds are ranked or compared with the performance of other growers.

GIPSA argued in its discussion of the proposed rule that USDA has long believed that unfair or deceptive practices or unreasonable or discriminatory preferences (Sections 202 (a) and (b) of the P&S Act) can be a violation of the P&S Act without a finding of harm to competition. GIPSA contended that Congress intended the same. They said that unlike in Sections 202 (c)-(e), which specifically note conduct that harms competition or creates monopolies, Congress did not include \"harm to competition\" and \"creates monopolies\" conditions in parts (a) and (b), and would have done so if it believed that harm to competition was necessary for determining a violation.", "GIPSA noted that courts of appeal have disagreed with USDA's view on harm to competition and stated that the courts are inconsistent with the language of the P&S Act in rulings that require findings of harm to competition. GIPSA said the courts have failed to defer to USDA's interpretation of the regulations. This line of reasoning was supported by the August 13, 2010, letter from the group of 21 Senators to Secretary Vilsack, which stated:", "A cardinal principle is that the courts are to give deference to the interpretation of laws by the federal agencies that are charged with implementing and administering them. Specifically, for instance, GIPSA is to be accorded deference in its interpretation, spelled out in the proposed rule, that the P&S Act protects individual producers against \"unfair, unjustly discriminatory, or deceptive practice[s] or devices[s]\" without a necessity of showing such conduct has an impact on the broader market.", "In Sections 201.210 and 201.211 of the proposed rule, GIPSA proposed to establish criteria for determining conduct that violates the P&S Act. GIPSA contended that conduct that is unfair or deceptive, or discriminatory, may not harm the larger market or harm competition within that market, but producers or growers may be hurt financially by the packer or poultry processor actions, and GIPSA said this would violate the P&S Act.", "Proponents of the rule contended that it is too difficult to prove harm to competition because sufficient or compelling evidence is difficult to acquire. GIPSA cited numerous examples where individual producers have been harmed by packer or poultry processor behavior that did not necessarily involve harm to competition. For example, some chicken growers have stated that even though there are two poultry processors in their areas, it is understood that growers can only grow for one company and cannot switch. Small hog producers claim that packers offer lower prices for small lots of hogs, even if hogs are comparable to larger lots from large producers.

Likewise, packers could only enter an exclusive arrangement with a dealer who has been identified as the packer's buyer and has officially notified GIPSA. USDA argued that the regulation would open livestock markets to more buyers and prevent collusion between multiple packers using one dealer as an exclusive agent, which it says could lead to price manipulation. GIPSA noted that this would especially benefit the cow/bull slaughter market, where a single dealer often buys for multiple packers, by opening the market to more dealers.", "Rule opponents argued that restricting livestock dealers to a single packer could impose a burden on packers, especially small packers who lack the resources to send multiple dealers across the countryside to various auction houses, sale barns, or feedlots.

Similarly, a single dealer may need to interact with multiple packers in order to obtain sufficient earnings.

They would have been required to rank growers in settlement groups with other growers with like poultry growing facilities.", "Proponents of the proposed rule, specifically some poultry producers, contended that the tournament system is \"designed to appear like a method to allow growers to compete fairly for pay based on performance. However, because the inputs that determine a producer's performance are supplied by the poultry company itself, the ranking system has become a back-door, anticompetitive mechanism for poultry companies to shift risks to growers and to discourage dissension.\" Proponents argued that because poultry processors provide inputs, such as chicks and feed, the contract growers have little control over the performance of their flocks.

Since the proposed rule prohibits discounts to base pay, poultry processors could reduce base pay below current levels to protect from paying poor performers more than if discounts were allowed. Premiums on base pay to the best growers might not match current levels. They argued that the current system already reflects the fundamentals of a free market that rewards efficiency.

Combined with the belief that the proposed rule would lead to more litigation because a lower standard than harm to competition would be applied, opponents believed that buyers might no longer want to pursue alternative marketing arrangements (AMAs) that pay premiums for delivering livestock or poultry with particular traits. Opponents asserted that buyers use these and other contracting arrangements to ensure a steady supply of animals (as well as other agricultural commodities) to keep high-capacity plants operating efficiently; such arrangements also allow for necessary price adjustments for quality, grade, or other market-prescribed factors. The proposals for change would hurt producers too, opponents added, because many of them use contracts or other marketing agreements with packers to limit their own exposure to price volatility and to obtain capital.

To gain industry-wide acceptance, this could be clarified so that companies could avoid uncertainty or error. Criteria could include feed/pasture information, genetics, and medical history, for example. Also, livestock that command market price premiums typically have identifiable physical attributes that distinguish them from \"average quality\" livestock. Top livestock producers may already keep records that would be suitable for enforcement of the rule. However, rule critics, in their comments, cited several examples of market situations where price differentials might emerge (for example, due to timing or geographic market conditions) for essentially the same livestock product.", "To further illustrate, critics offered the example of a packer that needs an additional 1,000 head of cattle to run its plant at peak efficiency. In its first market price offer, it might be able to obtain only 500 head. As a result, it makes a second higher-priced offer to obtain the second 500 head, even though all of the cattle are of comparable quality. In responding to market conditions, the packer did not exert any undue market power in acquiring the 1,000 head. Yet it is not clear if this transaction would violate the law or what documentation would justify this type of price differential.", "Status: USDA decided not to finalize the proposed provision on recordkeeping.
