In 2013, Michelle Bachelet and her center-left \"New Majority\" coalition won the presidency and sizeable majorities in both houses of the Chilean Congress after campaigning on a platform of ambitious reforms designed to reduce inequality and improve social mobility. Since her inauguration to a four-year term in March 2014, President Bachelet has signed into law significant changes to the tax, education, and electoral systems. She has also proposed a number of other economic and social policy reforms, as well as a process for adopting a new constitution. Although a significant majority of the public initially supported the reforms, Chileans have grown more divided over time, with some groups pushing for more far-reaching policy changes and others calling for Bachelet to scale back her agenda. Disapproval of the reforms, a corruption scandal that implicated her son, and Chile's slowing economy have taken a toll on President Bachelet's approval rating, which has declined to 29%.", "Chile's economic growth has slowed considerably in recent years, falling to 1.9% in 2014. Analysts have largely attributed the slowdown to the end of the global commodity boom and the coinciding drop in copper prices, which have a significant impact on the Chilean economy. There are also indications that the Bachelet Administration's policy reforms may have reduced business confidence and dampened growth. In order to stimulate the economy, the Chilean government has implemented expansive fiscal and monetary policies over the past year. Growth is forecast to accelerate slightly to 2.3% in 2015 and gradually increase in the following years.", "President Obama and President Bachelet have sought to build upon the long-standing partnership between the United States and Chile. Commercial ties are particularly strong. Total trade in goods and services reached $31 billion in 2014, more than quadrupling since the implementation of a free trade agreement in 2004. Trade and investment flows could increase if the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement, which includes the United States, Chile, and 10 other nations in the Asia-Pacific region, is approved. The United States and Chile also work together to address regional and global security challenges, such as instability in Haiti. The United States provided Chile with an estimated $1 million in foreign aid in FY2015 to strengthen the capabilities of Chilean security forces and foster closer security ties. The countries' mature partnership includes additional collaboration on issues such as energy development and scientific research.", "The 114th Congress is currently considering several measures related to U.S.-Chilean relations. Congress may consider implementing legislation for the TPP agreement under the rules and procedures set forth in the Bipartisan Comprehensive Trade Priorities Act (P.L. 114-26, \"trade promotion authority\"), which both houses passed and the President signed into law in June 2015. The Senate also may consider a bilateral income tax treaty with Chile (Treaty Doc. 112-8), which was signed in 2010, submitted to the U.S. Senate for its advice and consent in 2012, and reported favorably by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on November 10, 2015.

The country declared independence from Spain in 1810 but did not achieve full independence until 1818. Chile enjoyed mass electoral democracy from 1932 until 1973, when the Chilean military, under the control of General Augusto Pinochet, deposed the democratically elected Marxist government of President Salvador Allende (1970-1973). More than 3,200 people were killed or \"disappeared\" and some 38,000 people were imprisoned and/or tortured during Pinochet's 17-year dictatorship. Chile ultimately restored democratic governance in 1990.", "A center-left coalition of parties, known as the \"Coalition of Parties for Democracy\" ( Concertaci\u00f3n ), governed Chile for two decades after the return to democratic rule. While the Concertaci\u00f3n governments were significantly constrained by authoritarian provisions in the Pinochet-era constitution, they were able to enact incremental political, economic, and social reforms. They largely maintained the market-oriented economic framework they inherited from Pinochet and built upon it by negotiating a broad network of trade agreements designed to foster export-led development. Chile has implemented trade agreements with some 60 countries and now has open and reciprocal access to major consumer markets, such as China, Japan, the European Union, and the United States. The Concertaci\u00f3n also institutionalized countercyclical fiscal policies and gradually strengthened Chile's social safety net. Sebastian Pi\u00f1era of the center-right \"Alliance for Chile\" ( Alianza ) coalition broke the Concertaci\u00f3n's hold on power, serving as president from 2010-2014, but his administration largely maintained the same policy mix.", "Analysts credit Chile's policy framework for the significant economic and social gains that the country has made over the past 25 years. Real annual economic growth has averaged over 5% since 1990, lifting Chile's gross domestic product (GDP) to $258 billion and per capita GDP to $14,480 in 2014. The percentage of Chileans living below the national poverty line fell from 39% in 1990 to 8% in 2013, and the percentage of Chileans living in extreme poverty fell from 13% to 2.5% during the same time period. ", "Nevertheless, many Chileans have expressed discontent with the socioeconomic situation in their country. They are dissatisfied with the country's high level of inequality and believe that the country's economic gains have not translated into better living conditions and public services for most Chileans. The Gini coefficient, which is used to measure income concentration, has barely changed over the past decade, remaining near 0.53. Although it falls to 0.50 when taxes and government transfers are taken into account, it is well above the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average of 0.31. Moreover, intergenerational social mobility is low since the education system tends to replicate existing class disparities. ", "Chileans have also become increasingly dissatisfied with their political leaders and institutions, which have proven unable or unwilling to address these socioeconomic concerns. The country's unique binomial electoral system, a legacy of the Pinochet dictatorship, significantly limits the responsiveness of the Chilean government. Under the binomial system, deputies and senators are elected from two-member electoral districts that require a coalition to win by two-to-one margins in order to secure both seats. Since it effectively ensures a relatively equal distribution of power between the two major political coalitions regardless of voters' preferences, elections are extremely limited in their ability to produce change. Moreover, municipal and regional governments have little authority and few resources to address local concerns since political power is heavily concentrated in the central government. Given these constraints on electoral democracy, many Chileans have taken to the streets in recent years to voice their demands and hold their leaders accountable. Students calling for the government to guarantee free, high-quality education have organized the largest and most persistent of the protests."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "President Bachelet's Reform Agenda", "paragraphs": ["Seeking to capitalize on popular discontent and return to power, the four parties of the Concertaci\u00f3n joined with various social movement leaders, the Communist Party, and other left-leaning groups to form the \"New Majority\" ( Nueva Mayor\u00eda ) coalition for Chile's 2013 general elections. The coalition selected former President Michele Bachelet (2006-2010) as its presidential candidate and pledged to implement a series of ambitious policy changes designed to reduce inequality and improve social mobility. The three pillars of Bachelet's platform were a major fiscal reform, an overhaul of the education system, and a new constitution. Bachelet easily defeated the Alianza's Evelyn Matthei, 62%-38%, in a second round runoff election. In legislative elections held concurrently with the first-round presidential vote, Bachelet's coalition secured one of the largest congressional majorities since Chile's return to democracy, with 67 of 120 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 21 of 38 seats in the Chilean Senate (see Figure 1 ).", "President Bachelet has quickly moved forward with her policy agenda since assuming office for a four-year term in March 2014. Her first major initiative was a fiscal reform, which she signed into law in September 2014. It will be phased in over four years and is designed to increase revenues by 3% of GDP ($8.2 billion) by 2018. The majority of the new revenues will come from increasing the corporate tax rate from 20% to at least 25%. The reform also abolishes a business tax credit, taxes stationary sources of pollution such as fossil fuel power plants, increases taxes on tobacco and alcohol, reduces the top individual tax rate from 40% to 35%, and offers new incentives to small- and medium-size enterprises for savings and investment. Bachelet intends to use the additional revenue resulting from the fiscal reform to finance changes to Chile's education system, ensure the government budget is structurally balanced, and strengthen public health, pension, and social protection programs.", "Since the enactment of the fiscal reform, much of the political debate in Chile has focused on overhauling the education system. President Bachelet signed into law several initial education reforms in May 2015. Those changes, which are scheduled to take effect in March 2016, will cut off government funding to for-profit educational institutions and forbid primary and secondary schools that receive government funding from selectively admitting students. The Chilean Congress is still debating additional education reforms, including measures to strengthen teacher training, transfer school supervision from municipalities to the central government, and guarantee free post-secondary education for most students. The Bachelet Administration's 2016 budget proposal would enable 200,000 students whose families are in the bottom half of the income distribution to attend accredited nonprofit higher education institutions without paying tuition.", "In October 2015, President Bachelet announced a process for fulfilling her third major electoral pledge, the adoption of a new constitution. Over the course of the next year, the Bachelet Administration intends to educate citizens about the issues involved, hold a national dialogue to hear what Chileans would like to include in the constitution, and send a measure to the Chilean Congress that would authorize the next Congress\u2014scheduled to take office in 2018\u2014to select a mechanism for considering a new constitution. The new constitution would need to be approved by congressional supermajorities and a national referendum. The current constitution was adopted in 1980 under the Pinochet dictatorship. While many provisions have been amended since the reestablishment of democracy, some sectors of Chilean society still view it as illegitimate. Bachelet highlighted a number of potential constitutional changes in her electoral platform, including the recognition of various citizen rights and decentralization of power to regional governments. ", "As a result of an overhaul of the electoral system that President Bachelet signed into law in April 2015, the next Chilean Congress will be elected through proportional representation. Under the new system, each of Chile's 15 regions will elect between two and five senators, and Chileans will be divided into 28 multi-member electoral districts that will elect between three and eight deputies, depending on their population. The electoral reform will increase the number of seats in the Chamber of Deputies from 120 to 155 and the number of seats in the Senate from 38 to 50. It will also require political parties to ensure that no more than 60% of their candidates are the same gender. While advocates of the previous binomial electoral system maintain that it fostered political stability and consensus-based politics, detractors note that it significantly limited the ability of Chilean citizens to enact policy changes and hold their leaders accountable.", "In addition to these large-scale reforms of Chile's tax, education, and political systems, Bachelet and her New Majority coalition are pushing ahead with a number of other notable policy initiatives. These include a union-empowering labor reform, the creation of a state-run pension fund to compete with private retirement plans, decriminalization of abortion in certain circumstances, and repeal of the amnesty law that shields members of the Pinochet regime and security forces who committed human rights abuses between 1973 and 1978. They have already enacted a law establishing civil unions for same-sex couples. Many of these policy changes only require simple majorities in Congress and are likely to be enacted in some form.", "In the aftermath of a series of scandals that have tarnished much of the Chilean political establishment over the past year, the Bachelet Administration has focused on advancing anti-corruption policies. Chilean authorities have brought charges against several business executives and politicians from the right-wing Independent Democratic Union party\u2014part of the opposition Alianza coalition\u2014who allegedly were involved in a scheme to illegally finance the party and evade taxation. Other corruption scandals have implicated members of the governing New Majority Coalition. One case involves Bachelet's son, who is accused of using his influence during the presidential campaign to secure a $10 million real estate loan from one of Chile's most prominent businessmen. These corruption scandals have reinforced public perceptions in Chile that wealth and power are too concentrated in the hands of a small number of business and political elites who use their connections to exert influence and advance their economic interests. In an attempt to regain the initiative, Bachelet has introduced a series of anti-corruption bills, including measures to make campaign financing more transparent and impose tougher sanctions for corruption.", "A little over a year and a half into her term, the Chilean public remains divided over President Bachelet's reform agenda. While students, unions, and other groups have continued to hold demonstrations and have called on Bachelet and the Chilean Congress to enact more far-reaching policy changes more quickly, some economic and political analysts maintain that Chilean policymakers should slow down in order to reassure the business community and establish broader consensus on significant policy changes. Similar divisions have emerged within Bachelet's ideologically diverse New Majority coalition, which ranges from the Communist Party on the far left to the Christian Democratic Party in the center. Opinion polls have shown that nearly all of Bachelet's reforms have had broad public support upon their introduction, but they have become less popular over time as they have been subject to protracted debates in the Chilean Congress.", "President Bachelet's approval rating has declined significantly since she took office, with divisions regarding her reform agenda, recent corruption scandals, and the weakening economy (see \" Economic Challenges \" below) taking a toll on her popularity. In October 2015, 29% of Chileans approved of Bachelet's performance in office while 67% disapproved. Bachelet's approval rating has slightly improved from a low of 24% in August 2015, but is still far below the 54% approval rating she had upon taking office in March 2014. Chileans appear to be dissatisfied with the entire political class as the approval ratings for the governing New Majority coalition (22%), the opposition Alianza coalition (15%), the Senate (14%), and the Chamber of Deputies (10%) are even lower."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Economic Challenges", "paragraphs": ["President Bachelet is also attempting to address Chile's slowing economy. According to many analysts, Chile has the most competitive and fundamentally sound economy in Latin America, but it remains heavily dependent on the copper industry, which accounted for over half of Chile's exports and 11% of the country's GDP in 2014. While the global commodity boom contributed to an extended period of economic growth and job creation last decade, copper prices have steadily declined since 2011, taking a toll on the economy. Chile's economic growth slowed to 1.9% in 2014. Economic analysts attribute the deceleration to a sharp decline in private investment stemming from the drop in copper prices and other external factors, as well as a fall in business confidence that appears to be related to the Bachelet Administration's reforms.", "The Chilean government has sought to stimulate economic growth over the past year. The Bachelet Administration's 2015 budget increased public expenditure by nearly 10%, boosting spending on infrastructure and allocating additional resources for education, healthcare, and social welfare programs. Chile is in a relatively strong position to pursue countercyclical fiscal policies since gross public debt remains low (15.1% of GDP at the end of 2014) and it can draw from its Economic and Social Stabilization Fund, which holds $14.1 billion (equivalent to about 5.5% of GDP). The Chilean Central Bank has complemented the Bachelet Administration's fiscal stimulus with an expansionary monetary policy.", "Buoyed by these measures, Chile's annual economic growth is forecast to accelerate slightly to 2.3% in 2015. Growth is expected to remain well below the 2005-2014 average of 4.3% for several years, however, as the slowdown in China's economy, lower global commodity prices, and other global developments weigh down the country's open economy.

They experience higher poverty levels, lower education levels, and poorer living standards than the general Chilean population, and have long sought official recognition of their rights and restoration of their territories. Some Mapuche groups have employed militant means to achieve those objectives, occupying ancestral lands and destroying vehicles, machinery, and buildings located upon them. While most of the attacks have resulted in damaged property, a Mapuche activist was convicted of killing an elderly couple by setting fire to their remote ranch in 2013.", "The September 2014 anarchist bombings in Santiago and ongoing attacks by Mapuche activists in southern Chile have led to a renewed focus on Chile's antiterrorism law. The law dates to the Pinochet regime but has been amended several times since the return to democracy. It sets harsher penalties for crimes deemed to be terrorist acts and allows the government to detain those accused of such acts and hold them without bail before trial, among other provisions. Local and international human rights groups have criticized the Chilean government numerous times over the years for invoking the law to prosecute Mapuche activists. In July 2014, for example, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ordered the Chilean government to overturn the convictions of eight Mapuche activists who had been charged under the anti-terrorism law. While some legislators from the New Majority coalition have called for the anti-terrorism law to be repealed, the recent attacks have led others to call for a stronger anti-terrorism legal framework. ", "The Bachelet Administration has proposed several amendments to the anti-terrorism law, which are currently pending in Congress. They include changes to allow the infiltration of terrorist organizations by covert police officers and to extend the law to cover so-called \"lone-wolf\" terrorists. Bachelet has also announced special preventative measures to protect truckers after a series of arson attacks in southern Chile.

Those preferences allowed Chile to consolidate democratic governance and produce significant improvements in the living standards of its citizens, but they inhibited the political system's ability to address Chile's high level of inequality. Discontent with the limits of the post-Pinochet policy consensus propelled President Bachelet and her New Majority coalition to sizeable electoral victories. While their ambitious fiscal, educational, and constitutional reforms have produced uncertainty and could be damaging to the country's economy and stability if mishandled, they have the potential to foster inclusive growth and revitalize Chile's democratic institutions.", "U.S.-Chilean relations are likely to remain friendly in the coming years as a result of shared values and common interests. The countries currently cooperate on a range of issues, including trade, security, energy, and scientific research. Congressional approval of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and a bilateral income tax treaty could lead to higher levels of trade and investment, while approval of a pending extradition treaty could lead to enhanced security cooperation. The United States and Chile may also discover new areas for collaboration as Chile's ongoing transition to a higher level of economic development enables it to take on additional regional and global responsibilities.", "Map of Chile", "Chilean Political Party Acronyms"], "subsections": []}]}}
