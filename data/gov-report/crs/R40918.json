Title VI of the bill include a number of new provisions to raise revenues to pay for health care reform. These provisions include excise taxes, annual fees on health insurers, and limits on tax deductions for out-of-pocket health care expenses.", "In general, the Senate Finance bill would require adult individuals to maintain health insurance, with some exceptions. Employers would not be required to provide health insurance, although certain employers with more than 50 full-time employees who did not provide insurance could be required to pay a tax, under certain circumstances. Several insurance market reforms would be made, such as modified community rating and guaranteed issue and renewal. Both the individual mandates and the employer requirements would be linked to essential health benefits coverage. Essential health benefits coverage would include (1) coverage under a qualified health benefits plan (QHBP); (2) new group or individual coverage that meets or exceeds minimum health benefits; (3) grandfathered employment-based plans; (4) grandfathered nongroup plans; and (5) other coverage, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Individual and small group coverage under qualified health benefits plans would be allowed to be offered through non-profit, member-run health insurance companies. Such non-profit insurers would be eligible for grants and loans distributed through the new Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program. QHBP exchanges would offer a choice of private plans for coverage in the individual and small group markets. Based on income, certain individuals could qualify for a credit toward their premium costs and a subsidy for their cost-sharing; the credits and subsidies would be available only through an exchange. States would have the flexibility to establish basic health plans for low-income individuals not eligible for Medicaid. Existing plans would be grandfathered; however, once the bill is fully implemented, the private market reforms applicable to the small group market would also apply to grandfathered small group plans.

Either a state would establish separate exchanges to offer individual versus small group coverage, or the Secretary of Health and Human Services (hereafter referred to as the \"Secretary\" or \"HHS Secretary\" unless noted otherwise) would contract with a nongovernmental entity to establish and operate exchanges in states that did not establish them. Exchanges would not be insurers but provide eligible individuals and small businesses with access to private plans in a comparable way. Certain individuals with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level could qualify for credits toward their premium costs and subsidies towards their cost-sharing. This financial assistance would be available only through exchanges. States would be provided the flexibility to establish basic plans for low-income individuals not eligible for Medicaid. Existing plans offered by employers as well as plans offered in the individual market (the nongroup market) would be grandfathered.

This report summarizes key provisions affecting private health insurance in Titles I and VI of America's Healthy Future Act of 2009, as ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Finance on October 19, 2009. Although most of the provisions would be effective beginning in July 1, 2013, the table in the Appendix shows the timeline for implementing provisions effective prior to that date.", "Although the description that follows segments the private health insurance provisions into various categories, these provisions are interrelated and interdependent. For example, the bill includes a number of provisions to alter how current private health insurance markets function, primarily for individuals who purchase coverage directly from an insurer or through a small employer. S. 1796 would require that insurers not exclude potential enrollees or charge them premiums based on pre-existing health conditions. In a system where individuals voluntarily choose whether to obtain health insurance, however, individuals may choose to enroll only when they become sick. This can lead to a situation known as \"adverse selection,\" which may result in higher premiums and greater uninsurance. When permitted, insurers often guard against adverse selection by adopting policies such as underwriting health insurance policies based on individual health status and excluding coverage for pre-existing conditions. If reform eliminates many of the tools insurers use to guard against adverse selection, America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), the association that represents health insurers, has stated that all individuals must be required to have coverage (\"individual mandate\"), so that not just the sick enroll.", "Furthermore, some individuals currently forgo health insurance because they cannot afford the premiums. If individuals are required to obtain health insurance, one could argue that adequate premium subsidies must be provided by the government and/or employers to make practical the individual mandate to obtain health insurance, which is in turn arguably necessary to make the market reforms possible. In addition, premium subsidies without cost-sharing subsidies may provide individuals with health insurance that they cannot afford to use. So, while the descriptions below discuss various provisions separately, the removal of one from the bill could be deleterious to the implementation of the others.", "The private health insurance provisions are presented under the following topics, with the primary CRS contact listed for each:", "Individual mandate and employer requirements: the mandate for individuals to maintain health insurance and any requirements for employers.

People may get health coverage in the private sector or through a publicly funded program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. In 2008, 60% of the U.S. population had employment-based health insurance. Employers choosing to offer health coverage may either purchase insurance or choose to self-fund health benefits for their employees. Other individuals obtained coverage on their own in the nongroup market. However, there is no federal law that either requires individuals to have health insurance or requires employers to offer health insurance. Approximately 46 million individuals (15% of the U.S. population) were estimated to be uninsured in 2008. ", "Individuals and employers choosing to purchase health insurance in the private market fit into one of the three segments of the market, depending on their situation\u2014the large group (large employer) market, the small group market, and the nongroup market.", "More than 96% of large employers offer coverage. Large employers are generally able to obtain lower premiums for a given health insurance package than small employers and individuals seeking nongroup coverage. This is partly because larger employers have a larger \"risk pool\" of enrollees that makes the expected costs of care more predictable. Employers generally offer large subsidies toward health insurance, thus making it more attractive for both the healthier and the sicker workers to enter the pool. So, not only is the risk pool large in size, but it is also contains diverse risks. States have experimented with ways to create a single site where individuals and small employers could compare different insurance plans, obtain coverage, and sometimes pool risk. Although most of these past experiments failed (e.g., California's PacAdvantage ), other states have learned from these experiences and have fashioned potentially more sustainable models (e.g., Massachusetts' Connector ). There are private-sector companies that also serve the role of making various health insurance plans easier to compare for individuals and small groups (e.g., eHealthInsurance), available in most, but not all, states because of variation in states' regulations.", "Less than half of all small employers (less than 50 employees) offer health insurance coverage; such employers cite cost as the primary reason for not offering health benefits. One of the main reasons is a small group's limited ability to spread risk across a small pool. Insurers generally consider small firms to be less stable than larger pools, as one or two employees moving in or out of the pool (or developing an illness) would have a greater impact on the risk pool than they would in large firms. Other factors that impact a small employer's ability to provide health insurance include certain disadvantages small firms have in comparison with their larger counterparts: small groups are more likely to be medically underwritten, have relatively little market power to negotiate benefits and rates with insurance carriers, and generally lack economies of scale. Allowing these firms to purchase insurance through a larger pool, such as an Association, Gateway or an Exchange, could lower premiums for those with high-cost employees.", "Depending on the applicable state laws, individuals who purchase health insurance in the nongroup market may be rejected or face premiums that reflect their health status, which can make premiums lower for the healthy but higher for the sick. Even when these individuals obtain coverage, there may be coverage exclusions for certain conditions. Reforms affecting premiums ratings would likely increase premiums for some, while lowering premiums for others, depending on their age, health, behaviors, and other factors.", "States are the primary regulators of the private health insurance market, though some federal regulation applies, mostly affecting employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI). The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires that coverage sold to small groups (2-50 employees) must be sold on a guaranteed issue basis. That is, the issuer must accept every small employer that applies for coverage. All states require issuers to offer policies to firms with 2-50 workers on a guaranteed issue basis, in compliance with HIPAA. As of January 2009 in the small group market, 13 states also require issuers to offer policies on a guaranteed issue basis to self-employed \"groups of one.\" And as of December 2008 in the individual market, 15 states require issuers to offer some or all of their insurance products on a guaranteed issue basis to non-HIPAA eligible individuals. ", "Most states currently impose premium rating rules on insurance carriers in the small group and individual markets. The spectrum of existing state rating limitations ranges from pure community rating to adjusted (or modified) community rating, to rate bands, to no restrictions. Under pure community rating, all enrollees in a plan pay the same premium, regardless of their health, age or any other factor related to insurance risk. As of December 2008, only two states (New Jersey and New York) use pure community rating in their nongroup markets, and only New York imposes pure community rating rules in the small group market. Adjusted community rating prohibits issuers from pricing health insurance policies based on health factors, but allows it for other key factors such as age or gender. Rate bands allow premium variation based on health, but such variation is limited according to a range specified by the state. Rate bands are typically expressed as a percentage above and below the index rate (i.e., the rate that would be charged to a standard population if the plan is prohibited from rating based on health factors).", "Federal law requires that group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group health coverage must limit the period of time when coverage for pre-existing health conditions may be excluded. As of January 2009 in the small group market, 21 states had pre-existing condition exclusion rules that provided consumer protection above the federal standard. And as of December 2008 in the individual market, 42 states limit the period of time when coverage for pre-existing health conditions may be excluded for certain enrollees in that market. Moreover, while there are a handful of federal benefit mandates for health insurance that apply to group coverage, there are more than 2,000 cumulative benefit mandates imposed by the states. ", "One issue receiving congressional attention is whether a publicly sponsored health insurance plan should be offered as part of the insurance market reform. Some proponents of a public option see it as potentially less expensive than private alternatives, as it would not need to generate profits or pay brokers to enroll individuals and might have lower administrative costs. Some proponents argue that offering a public plan could provide additional choice and may increase competition, since the public plan might require lower provider payments and thus charge lower premiums. Some opponents question whether these advantages would make the plan a fair competitor, or rather provide the government with an unfair advantage in setting prices, in authorizing legislation, or in future amendments. Ultimately, opponents are concerned that these advantages might drive private plans from the market.", "Health insurance is provided by organizations that are either for-profit or non-profit in terms of their tax status. Some studies have suggested that non-profits perform better in key areas such as quality. For example, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in 1999 found that non-profit health maintenance organizations (HMOs) scored higher on all 14 Healthplan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS\u00ae) quality measures studied. These results were generally replicated in a study published in 2006 of 272 health plans conducted by researchers at the University of California at Berkeley and the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA). Health insurance co-operatives, a subset of non-profit plans, have performed particularly well as detailed in recent case studies of Group Health Cooperative of Seattle (GHC) and HealthPartners of Minnesota. ", "As of 2008, 47% of the enrollment in private health plans was in non-profit health insurance organizations. However, there are relatively few health insurance co-operative organizations in the United States. Some Congressional attention has been focused on options to incentivize the creation of new health insurance co-operatives. Advocates of this position argue that co-operatives invest retained earnings back into the plan or return the dollar to the membership, thus resulting in lower premiums, lower cost-sharing, expanded benefits, and innovations such as wellness programs, chronic disease management, and integrated care. Opponents of the proposal assert that co-operatives have not been successful in most of the country and that evidence is lacking that co-operatives would make health insurance more affordable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Health Plans Defined Under Title I", "paragraphs": ["S. 1796 would establish new health insurance plans and define existing ones in the private market applicable to Title I.

Any plan offered through the Exchange (described below) must be a QHBP.

Additionally, individuals whose required contribution for a calendar year exceeds 8% of household income would be exempt from the mandate. For tax years after 2013, the 8% would be adjusted by the Secretary to reflect the excess rate of premium growth and the rate of income growth for the period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Employer Requirements", "paragraphs": ["S. 1796 would not mandate employers to provide employees with coverage, however employers with more than 50 full-time employees (defined as working on average at least 30 hours per week) who did not provide coverage could be required to pay a penalty for certain employees.", "For those employers that chose to offer health insurance, the following rules would apply:", "Current employment-based plans would be grandfathered. Small employers could offer full-time employees and their dependents coverage in a QHBP. Large employers could offer full-time employees the opportunity to enroll in a group health plan, as long as the plan met requirements relating to annual and lifetime limits, annual limits on cost-sharing, and provided preventive items and services with cost-sharing only as allowed. An employer would not be treated as meeting the employer requirements for an employee, if (1) the employee is eligible for a premium credit because the employee's required contribution exceeds 10% of the employee's household income or (2) the plan's share of the total allowed costs of benefits provided under the plan is less than 65% of the costs (this requirement would not apply to QHBPs). Employers would not have to provide coverage for seasonal workers. Employers would be required to file a return providing the name of each individual for whom they provide essential health benefits coverage, the number of months of coverage, and any other information required by the Secretary. They would also be required to provide notice to employees about the existence of the exchange, including a description of the services provided by the exchange. A firm with more than 50 employees that chose not to offer health insurance could be subject to a penalty if any of its full-time employees were enrolled in a QHBP for which a premium credit or cost-sharing subsidy is allowed or paid for, for that employee. The penalty assessed to the employer for each such employee would be equal to the sum of the average annual credit and the average annual cost-sharing subsidy. However, the total penalty for an employer would be limited to $400 times the average number of the firm's employees. For example, consider an employer who did not offer health coverage and had 100 employees of which 30 full-time employees qualified for credits or subsidies through an exchange plan. If the penalty amount set by the Secretary of HHS for that year is $3,000 per employee, the total penalty for the firm would be $90,000 (30 x $3,000). Since the maximum amount an employer must pay per year is limited to the number of employees multiplied by $400, which in this case is $40,000 (100 x $400), the employer must pay only $40,000 (the lesser of $40,000 and the $90,000 calculated tax).

In 2011 and 2012, the credit could cover up to 35% of a qualified employer's share of health insurance coverage. Beginning in 2013, a qualified small employer purchasing insurance through the exchange could receive a tax credit for two years that covers up to 50% of the employer's contribution. Small businesses with 10 or fewer full-time employees and with average taxable wages of $20,000 or less could claim the full credit amount. This credit would be phased out as average employee compensation increased from $20,000 to $40,000 and as the number of full-time employees increased from 10 to 25. Employees would be counted if they received at least $5,000 in compensation, but the credit would not apply toward insurance for employees whose compensation exceeded $80,000 (highly compensated employees). Adjustments would be made for inflation after 2010. Full-time employees would be calculated by dividing the total hours worked by all employees during the tax year by 2,080 (with a maximum of 2,080 hours for any one employee). Seasonal workers would be exempt from this calculation. Non-profit organizations with 25 or fewer employees would also be eligible to receive tax credits if they meet the same requirements.

", "In addition to the specific provisions in S. 1796 that would directly modify these tax-advantaged plans, this proposal would also modify the definition of qualified medical expenses. Under current law qualified medical expenses for FSAs, HSAs, and HRAs can include over-the-counter medications. S. 1796 would restrict this practice and excludes over-the counter prescriptions (except those prescribed by a physician) as a qualified medical expense. According to the JCT, this provision would increase revenues by $5.4 billion over 10 years (see Table 3 ).

Medical expenses include health insurance premiums paid by the taxpayer, but also can include certain transportation and lodging expenses related to medical care as well as qualified long-term care costs, and long-term care premiums that do not exceed a certain amount. About 7% of tax returns for tax year 2007 reported a deduction for medical expenses. Taxpayers with adjusted gross income below $50,000 accounted for 52% of those taking this itemized deduction for medical expenses. S. 1796 would increase the threshold to 10% of AGI for taxpayers who are under age 65 which would limit the amount of medical expenses that can be deducted. Taxpayers over age 65 would still be subject to the 7.5% limit under current law. According to the JCT, this provision would raise revenues by $15.2 billion over 10 years (see Table 3 ).
