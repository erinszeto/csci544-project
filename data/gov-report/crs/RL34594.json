In recent years, five crops (corn, wheat, cotton, rice, and soybeans) account for over 90% of government commodity payments to farmers.", "The 2008 farm bill generally continues the farm commodity price and income support framework of the 2002 farm bill, with modifications. It continues the direct payment, counter-cyclical payment, and marketing loan programs for the 2008-2012 crop years, but adjusts target prices and loan rates for some commodities. The law also creates a pilot revenue-based counter-cyclical program (\"ACRE\") beginning with the 2009 crop year. The new law also has a pilot program for planting flexibility, new restrictions on base acres developed for residential use, and elimination of benefits to farms with fewer than 10 acres of program crops.

The 2008 farm bill revises payment limitations for the commodity programs by tightening some limits and relaxing others. Limits are tightened by (1) reducing the adjusted gross income (AGI) limit to $500,000 of non-farm AGI and $750,000 of farm AGI, (2) eliminating the \"three-entity rule,\" which allowed individuals to double their payments by having multiple ownership interests (doubling by having a spouse continues), and (3) requiring \"direct attribution\" of payments to a living person. Limits are relaxed by eliminating any limit on the marketing loan program. The new rules do not take effect until the 2009 crop year.", "Implementation has been problematic in two ways. First, the Administration did not allow farmers to combine land before enforcing the 10-acre restriction, an allowance Congress mentioned only in report language. Consequently, Congress passed H.R. 6849 to suspend enforcement of the 10-acre provision for one year and offset the cost with reductions in computer technology outlays and changes to the new permanent disaster program. The bill awaits the President's signature.", "The second implementation issue is that USDA is considering using prices from crop years 2006 and 2007 for setting the 2009 ACRE revenue guarantee, rather than the immediate past two years of 2007 and 2008, as Congress intended.

Imbalances develop because consumers do not respond to price changes by buying proportionally smaller or larger quantities (food demand is price inelastic). Similarly, farmers do not respond to price changes by proportionally reducing or increasing production (supply is price inelastic). These imbalances may contribute to volatile farm income, which can result in inadequate (or exaggerated) resource adjustments by farmers. Moreover, the long time lag between planting and harvest may magnify imbalances because economic and yield conditions may change.", "The economic argument against the farm commodity programs is that, like any subsidy, the farm programs distort production, capitalize benefits to the owners of the resources, encourage concentration of production, and comparatively harm smaller domestic producers and farmers in lower-income foreign nations.", "The objectives of federal commodity programs are to stabilize and support farm incomes by shifting some of the risks to the federal government. These risks include short-term market price instability and longer-term capacity adjustments. The goals are to maintain the economic health of the nation's farm sector so that it can utilize its comparative advantages to be globally competitive in producing food and fiber.", "Federal law mandates support for a specific list of farm commodities. For most of these commodities, support began during 1930s Depression-era efforts to raise farm household income when commodity prices were low because of prolonged weak consumer demand. While initially intended to be a temporary effort, the commodity support programs survived, but have been modified away from supply control and management of commodity stocks into direct income support payments.", "Critics of commodity programs usually acknowledge the underlying economic conditions that make stability more difficult to achieve for agriculture than for some other sectors. However, they argue that (1) current programs are highly distorting of world production and trade, (2) the levels of subsidies are high and have become capitalized into land prices and rents that raise the cost of production and make the United States less competitive in global markets, and (3) the benefits are concentrated among a comparatively small number of commodities produced on a small number of large farms.", "When farm programs were first authorized in the 1930s, most of the 6 million farms in the United States were small and diversified. Policymakers reasoned that stabilizing farm incomes using price supports and supply controls would help a large part of the economy (25% of the population lived on farms) and assure abundant food supplies. In recent decades, the face of farming has changed. Farmers now comprise less than 2% of the population. Most agricultural production is concentrated in fewer, larger, and more specialized operations. About 8% of farms account for 75% of farm sales (these 175,000 farms had average sales over $1 million). Most of the country's 2 million farms are part-time, and many operators rely on off-farm jobs for most of their income.", "Supporters of commodity subsidy programs may not contradict the critics, but do point out that other nations have distorting subsidy programs and/or trade barriers that should be eliminated if the United States is to make reforms. Landowners are concerned about a loss of rents and wealth if land prices drop in response to a reduction in the subsidies. Similarly, rural communities are concerned about any large decline in the real estate tax base that supports local schools, roads, and other community services. While large farms receive most of the production-linked subsidy payments, recipients argue that lower input costs and marketing efficiencies make large farms efficient and small farms uneconomic in the production of bulk commodities. Therefore, targeting subsidies to small farms, recipients say, would encourage inefficient production."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Authorizing Legislation", "paragraphs": ["The authority for USDA to operate farm commodity programs comes from three permanent laws, as amended: the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (P.L. 75-430), the Agricultural Act of 1949 (P.L. 81-439), and the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Charter Act of 1948 (P.L. 80-806). Congress typically alters these laws through multi-year omnibus farm bills to address current market conditions, budget constraints, or other concerns.", "If a new farm bill is not enacted when an old one expires, we would revert to the permanent laws mentioned above for the commodities programs. Under permanent law, eligible commodities would be supported at levels much higher than they are now, and many of the currently supported commodities might not be eligible. Since reverting to permanent law is incompatible with current national economic objectives, global trading rules, and federal budgetary policies, pressure builds at the end of one farm bill to enact another.", "The 2008 farm bill ( P.L. 110-246 ) contains the most recent version of the commodity price and income support programs.

Peanuts are supported similarly. Farmers receive constant \"direct payments\" tied to historical production (except pulse crops do not receive direct payments despite being a covered commodity).

In addition, an individual must comply with certain conservation and planting flexibility rules. A term commonly used in federal regulations is \"actively engaged in farming,\" which generally means providing significant contributions of capital (land or equipment) and labor and/or management, and receiving a share of the crop as compensation. Conservation rules include protecting wetlands, preventing erosion, and controlling weeds. Planting flexibility rules allow crops other than the program crop to be grown, but generally prohibit planting fruits or vegetables on subsidized acreage.", "Modern farming enterprises usually involve some combination of owned and rented land. Two types of rental arrangements are common: cash rent and share rent.", "Under cash rental contracts, the tenant pays a fixed cash rent to the landlord. The landlord receives the same rent, bears no risk in production, and thus is not eligible to receive program payments. The tenant bears all of the risk, takes all of the harvest, and receives all of the government subsidy. Under share rental contracts, the tenant usually supplies most of the labor and machinery, while the landlord supplies land and perhaps some machinery or management. Both the landlord and tenant bear risk in producing a crop and receive a portion of the harvest. Both are eligible to share in the government subsidy.", "Even though tenants might receive all of the government payments under cash rent arrangements, they might not keep all of the benefits if landlords demand higher rent. Economists widely agree that a large portion of government farm payments passes through to landlords, and that government payments raise the price of land.

Of the counter-cyclical payments, only traditional price-triggered counter-cyclical payments are included in the figure. Using corn as an example, if market prices are above $2.35/bushel, neither counter-cyclical nor marketing loan benefits (e.g., LDP) would apply. If market prices are between $1.95 and $2.35/bushel, a counter-cyclical payment would accrue, but no LDP would be available. If market prices are below the loan rate of $1.95/bushel, the maximum counter-cyclical payment of $0.40/bushel is made, and an LDP would be available equal to the difference between the $1.95 loan rate and the market price. Regardless of market prices, however, the direct payment of $0.28/bushel is paid.", "An important consideration for the farm commodity programs is how they are classified for trade purposes. As a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the United States made agricultural policy commitments under the WTO's Agreement on Agriculture. All WTO members agree to submit annual notifications of their farm program outlays to the WTO, and these outlays are subject to specific limits. For the United States, its total spending limit for programs that are considered to be trade distorting is $19.1 billion per year.

For many farms, base acres date to the 1980s, but for some farms base acres were updated in 2002. In addition to its base acreage, each farm has a \"direct payment yield\" for each commodity, which is also an unchanging historical average based on the farm's actual yields over the 1981-1985 period.", "A farmer is not obligated to grow the covered commodity to receive a direct payment for that commodity (e.g., a farm may plant soybeans on corn base acres, and receive the direct payment for corn). The rationale for this planting flexibility is to allow farmers to respond to market signals when choosing crops.", "Because direct payments are constant and allow planting flexibility, they are arguably less distorting of production than prior farm programs that had greater government intervention. Direct payments thus are thus known as \"decoupled\" payments, and the United States has classified them as \"green box\" when reporting agricultural subsidies to the WTO. Green box payments help countries comply with international trade agreements because they do not count against subsidy ceilings.", "However, because the planting flexibility rules still have restrictions on planting fruits and vegetables (discussed later in this report), the direct payment program may be subject to challenge as to whether it qualifies as a green box payment. This challenge was raised during the 2008 farm bill debate as a reason to revise the direct payment program or allow complete planting flexibility, but the program was not changed.", "In the 2008 farm bill, the direct payment rates per commodity remain the same as in the 2002 farm bill ( Table 1 ), but the overall formula to compute the payment contains a 2% reduction in direct payments for crop years 2009-2011. Conferees accomplished this by changing the ratio of base acres on which direct payments are made from 85% to 83.3%. The 85% ratio is restored for the 2012 crop year to maintain a higher baseline for the next farm bill.", "The law eliminates advance direct payments beginning in the 2012 crop year. This delays advance payment of 22% of the direct payment from the December before most crops are planted to the following October at or after harvest, and thus into a new fiscal year. This scores budget savings of about $1.1 billion in FY2012.

Historically, the farm commodity programs have focused on price, but producers have cited insufficient government support during years with natural disasters when yields are low and prices are high. In those years, they have little to sell and thus do not benefit from high market prices, but do not receive counter-cyclical support either. In response to this criticism, the 2008 farm bill creates a revenue-based counter-cyclical program called the Average Crop Revenue Election (ACRE). The ACRE program is an alternative to the traditional price counter-cyclical program, and is based on statewide crop-specific revenue data. ACRE makes payments when actual revenues from a commodity are less than a market-based, moving average revenue guarantee.", "Eligible commodities for either counter-cyclical option include the covered commodities for the direct payment program (wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley, oats, upland cotton, rice, peanuts, soybeans, and other oilseeds), plus four new pulse crops beginning in 2009 (dry peas, lentils, small chickpeas, and large chickpeas)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Traditional Counter-Cyclical Payments (CCP)", "paragraphs": ["Traditional counter-cyclical payments compensate for the difference between a crop's target price and a lower effective market price.

Six out of 10 ongoing commodities receive a target price increase (wheat, sorghum, barley, oats, soybeans, and minor oilseeds), one has a small decrease (cotton), three are unchanged (corn, rice, and peanuts), and four are new in 2009 (dry peas, lentils, small chickpeas, and large chickpeas).", "Some commodity groups argued that their support levels were not high enough relative to other commodities in the 2002 farm bill (e.g., wheat and soybeans).", "The decrease in the cotton target price is the only change in the 2008 crop year.
