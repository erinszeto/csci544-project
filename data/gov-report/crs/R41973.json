EPA that the Clean Air Act's (CAA's) \"sweeping\" definition of \"air pollutant\" embraces \"any air pollutant ... including any physical, chemical ... substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air.\" Also, the Court ruled that EPA could not use policy considerations in deciding whether to regulate GHG emissions; EPA can avoid taking further action \"only if it determines that greenhouse gases do not contribute to climate change or if it provides some reasonable explanation as to why it cannot or will not exercise its discretion.\" Following this decision, EPA found that GHG-induced climate change endangers human health and welfare and has acted to promulgate regulations to control six GHG.", "Most experts, and also the Obama Administration, would prefer new legislation strategically addressing GHG abatement, rather than authorities under the CAA, as a policy vehicle to address climate change.

They may also assume that investment in technology research will reduce GHG abatement costs, making it cheaper to reduce emissions later. Following this approach, the U.S. government has invested many billions of dollars in climate research and \"clean\" technologies over the past two decades, with a small fraction allocated to policies that directly mitigate the risks or promote adaptation to them.", "Some scientists and advocates for emissions abatement action have welcomed the resources for research, but also expressed the likelihood that research may well widen, not narrow, uncertainties. No matter how much is invested in research, critical uncertainties are likely to remain. Some people have argued that research cannot provide \"right\" policy answers and that this strategy constitutes avoidance of difficult decisions. In contrast, others have pointed to analysis that wrong actions taken in the context of uncertainties may result in unnecessary costs. Some have suggested that economic conditions in the future may make addressing climate change more affordable than the present: increasing incomes and improving technologies could make it easier for future generations to pay to address climate change than for people today.", "Research has made significant scientific progress over the past three decades. Still, it may be easier to argue that uncertainties may now be better characterized but not narrowed; some may have widened. It is unclear that further research within the next decade or two will significantly narrow crucial uncertainties, such as prediction of precipitation patterns over the next 50 years (needed to estimate climate change risks, such as impacts on costs of agricultural production or flood control, as examples). If over that period GHG emissions continue to rise, future GHG policies would need to make greater and more rapid reductions in order to avoid any particular level of risk reduction. Federally supported research also has made new technologies available and reduced the costs of others. The lowering of technology costs during that period may or may not offset the added costs of starting later, with greater, more rapid GHG reductions to achieve a given level of risk reduction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Science-Based Goals", "paragraphs": ["Some advocates propose a science-centric approach, looking to physical or biological criteria to identify appropriate policy goals. This assumes that science alone can provide an objective standard of a \"safe\" or \"tolerable\" level or rate for climate change, or at least an inflection point beyond which the projected damages of climate change may rise more steeply. Proponents of this approach may look to past rates of temperature change, past (i.e., pre-industrial) atmospheric concentrations of GHG, or indicators of ecosystem adaptability, for identifying the policy goal. Typically, the science-based approach draws on the estimated relationships between GHG emissions, GHG atmospheric concentrations, global average temperature changes, and projected impacts of climate change for identifying equivalent targets across these different parameters ( Figure 2 and Table 1 ).", " Table 1 summarizes estimates of the amount that climate would change (Column 3, measured as the increase in the global mean temperature above the preindustrial levels) if GHG concentrations in the atmosphere were to rise to different levels (Column 1) and then stabilize there. CO 2 concentrations in 2011 are about 392 parts per million (ppm). GHG levels (Column 2, converted to CO 2 -equivalents and added) are about 450 ppm.

Countries agreed in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to an objective of avoiding \"dangerous\" climate change, often characterized as avoiding a particular temperature increase (first bullet above); negotiations have tended to focus on reducing emissions to levels compatible with achieving that objective of avoiding \"dangerous\" change. The U.S. congressional debate on climate change strategy has focused most strongly on percentage-reduction targets for GHG emissions and on which policy tools to use rather than debating what science-based policy goals might be.", "There are many challenges to using primarily science to set climate change policy targets. First, differing degrees of confidence in scientific findings affects different peoples' willingness to take actions. Arguably, much of the U.S. public debate has been about whether to have confidence in the consensus of climate change scientists.", "Second, policy targets are easiest to communicate with simple metrics, but simple metrics may not clearly reflect the many complex dimensions of climate science. For example, although global average temperature is a common proxy for climate change (\"global warming\"), many risks may be more closely tied to other dimensions, such as changes in local temperature extremes, time of last frost, maximum spring river flow, storm severity, or sea levels. Other impacts may depend strongly on the changing character of precipitation, which may increase or decrease at different locations and times, more than on temperature change. Metrics alternative to global average temperature change are more difficult to characterize as policy targets, and averages may not correlate with adverse impacts.", "Third, scientists, economists, and other experts differ in their views of which climate changes and impacts are important for setting policy. For example, should decisions emphasize what is happening (or not happening) now, or give weight to the distant impacts over many centuries of possible melting of most of Antarctica? Or, is it practical to consider that the Earth's biomes may shift and reorganize substantially over coming decades, when the full impacts of such changes may be impossible to predict? Some people may not weigh impacts occurring outside their state or country as heavily as those at home. Some may give more weight to impacts on humans than on other species or landscapes. Science does not offer tools for handling such policy considerations.", "Fourth, policy-makers and stakeholders have very different preferences for accepting different risks and their willingness to accept risks. As a 2011 National Research Council report states:", "It should be emphasized that choosing among different targets is a policy issue rather than a strictly scientific one, because such choices involve questions of values, e.g., regarding how much risk to people or to nature might be considered too much.", "Sometimes, scientific guidance for limits is available if there are thresholds above which adverse effects begin to occur or the rate of increase of adverse effects becomes more rapid or irreversible. These are called \"critical thresholds\" or \"tipping points.\" Scientists have been examining a host of potential critical thresholds in the climate system: they exist in many ecological systems and could be catastrophic for some populations or systems, or possibly on a global scale (e.g., if the Amazon rainforest were to collapse and shift to a deciduous forest or savannah system). The effects of CO 2 emissions on ocean acidification, though not \"climate change,\" may present thresholds with greater scientific certainty for setting policies than CO 2 effects on temperature. (See text box. )", "For some, appropriate GHG emissions limits may be tied to assessment of technological feasibility (and technology costs). While technologies exist today to begin a trajectory of major GHG reductions, targets that would stabilize GHG concentrations would require development and deployment of new technologies over the longer term. Some congressional proposals have aimed at promoting new technology development and market penetration, though not with a stated quantitative objective.", "An emissions-denoted policy target may be easier than concentrations or temperature targets, given the range of climate changes that could occur with a given increase in GHG emissions. Also, the United States could not unilaterally achieve a federally set concentration or temperature target; it would require a global effort. Further, only emission limits are viewed as a practical basis for allocating responsibilities to the sources of emissions (i.e., private businesses), and for enforcing those limits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Economics-Based Approaches", "paragraphs": ["While many scientists, environmentalists, and other stakeholders may advocate scientifically determined policy goals, other stakeholders frequently advocate that policies should be designed to maximize economic efficiency (or to maximize economic growth measured as Gross Domestic Product, GDP).", "There are several economic approaches that could help define climate change policy, including cost-effectiveness analysis, cost-benefit analysis, or hedging. This section focuses on a cost-benefit approach, which seeks to maximize the economic efficiency of policy."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cost-Benefit Approach", "paragraphs": ["Intuitively, many people only take actions when they perceive that the benefits of the action exceed its costs, though the important benefits and costs may be qualitative, not monetary. For decisions of public policy, many economists and business stakeholders advocate that formal assessment of the costs and benefits of a proposed policy (or policy alternatives) should be performed and that the only options selected should be those wherein the benefits exceed the costs. This preference is predicated on the principle that policies should seek to be efficient, making best use of private and public resources available. Indeed, in 1981, President Ronald Reagan issued Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 13193 3 CFR, 1981). E.O. 12291 requires that regulatory objectives seek to the maximize net benefits to society, although some legislative authorities direct other considerations to be paramount (e.g., protecting the most vulnerable populations).", "There are limitations of formal cost-benefit analysis (CBA), however, and particularly as applied to climate change policy-making. First is the consideration that CBA addresses efficiency, but typically not other policy considerations, such as \"fairness\" (although some economists are testing methods to address some equity issues). Additionally, problems to applying CBA to climate change have been established by a variety of researchers:", "1. Climate change decisions will be made (or not made) by many disparate people and organizations, public and private, in the context of multiple goals, constraints, and secondary effects; the sum of their decisions (and their costs and benefits) would necessarily differ from the options and valuations considered in a cost-benefit analysis. 2. Estimates of costs and of benefits may be unreliable. Several studies following completion of projects or after implementation of policy decisions have shown that prospective estimates may be very inaccurate. Decisions based on inaccurate estimates may be inefficient. Some researchers have found that retrospective evaluations of actual costs or benefits may reveal them to be very different, at least in some cases, than pre-decision projections. 3. CBA methods assume that a policy decision is \"marginal,\" that it can be made in clearly ordered increments from some baseline level, and that the choice can be isolated from significant changes in the structure and output of the entire economy. However, some analysts contend that human-induced climate change is a \"non-marginal\" problem: decisions to address it or not would alter the structure, the path of growth, and even the existence of some economies. At least one study has shown that applying marginal analysis to non-marginal policy questions can produce both quantitatively and qualitatively \"wrong\" decisions. 4. The outcomes of CBA for choices having long-term effects can be strongly determined by the choice of \"discount rates\" to reflect the \"time value of money\"\u2014that is, the observation that people typically would prefer to get a given amount of money today rather than a year from now. Respected economists disagree over what the appropriate discount rate should be for climate change decisions, and even whether discounting should be used at all when choices affect unborn generations. This discounting controversy remains unresolved despite decades of discourse. 5. CBA, at least as practiced, typically uses single point estimates whereas many values important in climate change analysis are uncertain\u2014sometimes widely uncertain. Few, if any, researchers have conducted analyses in ways that adequately reflect the distributions of uncertainties and the interactions of uncertain variables in their analyses. 6. Moreover, the \"average\" values used frequently assume that people are neutral to risks (they equally weight higher versus lower risks), while empirical data indicate that most people seem to be \"risk averse\" (i.e., they would make lower-risk choices even in instances where their expected payoffs on average would be greater with the higher-risk choice). Arguably, differences among people in their aversions to particular kinds of risks in climate change policy choices\u2014whether more attuned to risks of energy cost increases or to employment, or whether more to health and ecological stability\u2014make it more difficult to build consensus on policy. 7. Some critics suggest that CBA does not support an appropriate decision rule. CBA assumes a \"Kaldor-Hicks\" rule\u2014that the optimal public decision should make everyone in aggregate better off, even if those who are made worse off are not compensated by those made better off. Some economists have pointed out theoretical problems in applying the Kaldor-Hicks rule, for example, that it can result in inconsistent decisions. In addition, one economist notes that \"social decision-making necessarily is about weighing up gains and losses and deciding on the relative importance of different individuals' gains and losses.\" CBA typically does not assist in making those trade-offs. Proponents point out that CBA provides one type of information\u2014not that it is the only and exclusive criterion for public policy decisions.", "Economic analyses would be, at best, incomplete and likely biased because of the current state of information and methods. Many values that should be included in a rigorous CBA are unknown, and even unimagined at this stage of understanding. The direction of bias most often is posited to undercount benefits of mitigation policies, though there are reasons that omissions could overstate climate damages as well (e.g., by missing low-cost adaptations that people might make). Despite these challenges, formal CBA arguably provides one of the most complete frameworks for organizing and presenting a vast array of incommensurate impacts for decision-makers. However, CBA is unlikely in the near term to yield a simple or objective \"answer\" on optimal policy for decision-makers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Hedging or Insurance Policies", "paragraphs": ["An alternative economic approach is \"hedging\" or insurance, by adopting policies that would reduce the risks of losses, without certainty of what those risks are. This approach can be similar to buying homeowners' insurance even though the likelihood of fire or other losses is unknown. In this approach, policy-makers might enact some low-cost measures or measures that serve other policy goals. (Sometimes these are called \"no regrets\" measures.) If long-term restructuring of the energy economy might be needed in the future, hedging policies might initiate measures in that direction (such as research support for some new technologies) while further information on risks evolves.

An adaptive approach entails setting an initial policy, then monitoring and evaluating progress toward the stated goal, and making adjustments as knowledge is gained and new opportunities become available. Two proponents of adaptive strategies argue:", "[C]limate change presents a problem of decision-making under conditions of deep uncertainty. We begin with the premise that while we know a great deal about the potential threat of climate change and the actions we might take to prevent it, we cannot now, nor are we likely for the foreseeable future [to], answer the most basic questions, such as is climate change a serious problem and how much would it cost to prevent it? We argue that in the face of this uncertainty, we should seek robust strategies. Robust strategies are ones that will work reasonably well no matter what the future holds.... [R]obust strategies for climate change are possible by means of adaptive-decision strategies, that is, strategies that evolve over time in response to observations of changes in the climate and economic systems. Viewing climate policy as an adaptive process provides an important reconfiguration of the climate-change policy problem.", "Several concerns about adaptive approaches may be raised. First, while an adaptive approach may achieve overall efficiencies compared to less flexible strategies, the efficiencies come at a cost of lessened certainty for investors that a policy will remain fixed (e.g., for investment on long-lived infrastructure). This can raise the risks of certain investments and add to their costs.", "Second, some people conclude that abating climate change would require radical technological change, and perhaps changes in social and economic structures, which cannot be achieved with incremental changes. Experts point to \"path dependence\" of economic structures and technological evolution, in which initial conditions set a trajectory or \"path\" that becomes increasingly difficult to modify as investments build on one another. \"Muddling through\" follows that path dependence, almost by definition. Others propose that successfully addressing climate change requires \"transformational change,\" a change in state that is not merely an extension of the past.", "Also, pursuing adaptive strategies, Lempert and Schlesinger have argued that \"the real measure of ... success\" should not be near-term GHG reductions, but \"rather the new potential for large-scale emissions reductions society has created for the years ahead.\" Though this point may be valid, it may be, alternatively, that expanding the potential for emissions reductions requires incentives to shift from a \"business-as-usual\" path that may not be provided by incrementalism. Transformational change frequently alters power relationships, and may be obstructed by a human tendency to ignore or reject information that does not conform with one's existing beliefs or prior decisions.

Frequently, this step is among the most controversial in establishing control policy. (Alternatively, the policy-makers may not set a particular limit or standard, but require all regulated sources to buy emissions permits.) Typically, at the end of a compliance period (e.g., a year), a source must turn in to the regulating authority a number of allowances at least equal to the tons emitted in that period.", "The second decision is how emissions sources will get their emission allowances.

Giving allowances to particular groups may be a tempting way to increase the acceptability of a GHG control program, or to improve the \"fairness\" of the program, but it could distort incentives and reduce the efficiency of the program. One way (among others) to minimize the transfer of wealth in a GHG control program would be to sell allowances rather than to give them away. Sales, including auctions, would increase the efficiency of an overall GHG reduction. Selling the allowances at a fixed price becomes very much like an emission fee or tax program.

At least one study found that, in some circumstances, technology mandates may be more effective than direct financial incentives.
