Job creation and the development of a domestic renewable energy manufacturing base have joined national security and environmental concerns as reasons for promoting the manufacturing of solar power equipment in the United States. The federal government maintains a variety of tax credits and targeted research and development programs to encourage the solar manufacturing sector, and state-level mandates that utilities obtain specified percentages of their electricity from renewable sources have bolstered demand for large solar projects.", "The most widely used solar technology involves photovoltaic (PV) solar modules, which draw on semiconducting materials to convert sunlight into electricity. By year-end 2013, the total number of grid-connected PV systems nationwide reached more than 445,000. Domestic demand is met both by imports and by about 75 U.S. manufacturing facilities employing upwards of 30,000 U.S. workers in 2014. Production is clustered in a few states including California, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, and Washington.", "Domestic PV manufacturers operate in a dynamic, volatile, and highly competitive global market now dominated by Chinese and Taiwanese companies. China alone accounted for nearly 70% of total solar module production in 2013. Some PV manufacturers have expanded their operations beyond China to places like Malaysia, the Philippines, and Mexico. Overcapacity has led to a precipitous decline in module prices, which have fallen 65%-70% since 2009, causing significant hardship for many American manufacturers. Some PV manufacturers have closed their U.S. operations, some have entered bankruptcy, and others are reassessing their business models. Although hundreds of small companies are engaged in PV-related manufacturing around the world, profitability concerns appear to be driving consolidation, with fewer than a dozen firms now controlling half of global module production.", "In 2012, the United States imposed significant dumping and countervailing duties on imports of Chinese solar products after ruling that U.S. producers had been injured by dumped and subsidized solar equipment from China. In a second case, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) ruled in 2014 and early 2015 that U.S. producers were being injured by imports of Chinese-made modules that avoided the duties imposed in 2012 by incorporating solar cells from Taiwan. While these duties may help U.S. production become more competitive with imports, the cost of installing solar systems might rise. Domestic demand for solar products may also be depressed by the end of various federal incentives. Unless extended, the commercial Investment Tax Credit for PV systems will revert to 10% from its current 30% rate after 2016, while the 30% credit for residential investments will expire.", "Looking ahead, the competitiveness of solar PV as a source of electric generation in the United States will likely be adversely affected by the rapid development of shale gas, which has lowered the cost of gas-fired power generation and made it harder for solar to compete as an energy source for utilities. In light of these developments, the ability to sustain a significant U.S. production base for PV equipment is in question."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Major developments affecting the domestic photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing sector include technological advances, improved production methods, dramatically lower prices for PV modules, and trade frictions, particularly with China. These volatile industry trends have adversely affected the operations of many solar companies, forcing some to reassess their business models and others to close factories or declare bankruptcy. In addition, the rapid growth in shale gas production has the potential to affect the competitiveness of solar power, as cheap natural gas possibly may provide an alternative source of energy at a lower price. If oil and gas prices stay low, demand for renewable energy, including solar, might be hurt. These trends affect the ability of the United States to build a sustained domestic production base for PV equipment.", "U.S. solar manufacturing makes up a small part of the U.S. manufacturing base. In 2014, the nation's solar manufacturing industry directly employed about 32,000 workers, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), a trade group. The U.S. cell and module market, measured by domestic shipment revenues, has grown in size from $3.3 billion in 2008 to $7.1 billion in 2012, reports the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Following an unprecedented period of growth, the number of PV systems in the United States reached more than 445,000 by the end of 2013, more than twice the total at the end of 2011.", "Government support has been instrumental in sustaining the solar industry worldwide. In the United States, tax incentives and stimulus funding have helped to spur new PV installations. In its 2013 annual report, SEIA wrote that \"more solar has been installed in the United States in the last eighteen months than in the 30 years prior.\" Nevertheless, even with direct government involvement, solar energy merely accounts for 0.5% of overall U.S. electricity generation. The Obama Administration actively supports greater deployment of solar energy and sees it as one way to encourage advanced manufacturing in the United States, create skilled manufacturing jobs, and increase the role of renewable energy technology in energy production, among other objectives. In its Solar Progress Report: Advancing Toward a Clean Energy Future , the Obama Administration argues that \"The Administration's investments have helped expand U.S. manufacturing capabilities, including new facilities to produce cost-effective, high quality solar panels as well as startup operations to commercialize novel PV and concentrating solar power (CSP) technologies.\"", "This report looks at the solar photovoltaic manufacturing industry and its supply chain; employment trends; international trade flows; and federal policy efforts aimed at supporting the industry. It does not cover other methods of solar-power generation, such as concentrating solar power plants. Concentrating solar technologies, largely dormant prior to 2006, are suitable mainly for utility-scale generation, whereas solar photovoltaics can be arranged in small-scale installations to produce power for individual buildings and in large installations to supply power to utilities. ", "Even with decreasing PV prices, producing equipment that generates solar power at prices competitive with electricity generated from fossil fuels remains a challenge. This is particularly true for utility-scale installations, as wholesale purchasers of electricity will compare the cost per megawatt hour of solar power directly with the cost of power from other sources. The cost-competitiveness of solar power is better in the residential and business markets, as the relevant comparison is with the delivered cost of electricity rather than with the generating cost. But even if the popularity of solar systems grows, falling equipment prices are likely to undermine efforts to sustain a solar manufacturing base in the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Manufacturing", "paragraphs": ["Solar PV manufacturing, previously undertaken by numerous small firms, is rapidly maturing into a global industry dominated by a smaller number of producers. Cell manufacturers typically have proprietary designs that seek to convert sunlight into electricity at the lowest total cost per kilowatt hour. Vertical integration, whereby manufacturers produce their own components from wafers to modules, is becoming more common, but many PV manufacturers still rely on extensive supply chains for components such as wafers, glass, wires, and racks. Worldwide, the market for solar PV (including modules, system components, and installations) expanded from $2.5 billion in 2000 to $91.3 billion in 2013, according to one estimate."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Manufacturing Process", "paragraphs": ["PV systems do not require complex machinery and thousands of parts. In fact, most PV systems have no moving parts at all. They also have long service lifetimes, typically ranging from 10 to 30 years, with some minor performance degradation over time. In addition, PV systems are modular; to build a system to generate large amounts of power, the manufacturer essentially joins together more components than required for a smaller system. These characteristics make PV manufacturing quite different from production of most other types of generating equipment. In particular, PV systems offer little opportunity for manufacturers to make customized, higher-value products to meet unique needs. Manufacturers offer competing technological approaches to turning sunlight into electricity, but many customers have no reason to care about the technology so long as the system generates the promised amount of electricity. Economies of scale are significant, as increasing output tends to lower a factory's unit costs. ", "Crystalline silicon PV is the main technology used by solar manufacturers, and accounted for about 90% of global PV production in 2013. Production of a crystalline silicon system involves several stages:", "Polysilicon M anufacturing . Polysilicon, based on sand, is the feedstock for the PV and semiconductor industries. It is the material used to make the semiconductors that convert sunlight into electricity. Polysilicon accounts for about a quarter of the cost of a finished solar panel. Approximately 90% of demand for polysilicon comes from the solar PV industry. Production requires large processing plants that may cost of up to $1 billion to build. Historically, polysilicon prices have been volatile because the construction of a new plant can add a large amount of supply to the market. A handful of manufacturers dominate polysilicon production. In 2013, the largest polysilicon manufacturer was GLC Poly from China, followed by Wacker-Chemie from Germany, Hemlock from the United States, and OCI from South Korea. In 2013, nearly half of the world's polysilicon was produced by Chinese and South Korean companies. Wafer M anufacturing . Using traditional semiconductor manufacturing equipment, wafer manufacturers, including companies such as Elkem, LDK Solar, Okmetic, Siltronic, Nexolon, and SunEdison (formerly MEMC), shape polysilicon into ingots and then slice the ingots into thin wafers. The wafers are then cut, cleaned, and coated according to the specifications of the system manufacturers. Cell M anufacturing. Solar cells are the basic building blocks of a PV system. They are made by cutting wafers into desired dimensions (typically 5 x 5 or 6 x 6 inches) and shapes (round, square, or long and narrow). The manufacturer, such as Yingli, Trina Solar, or Sharp, then attaches copper leads so the cell can be linked to other cells. Minimizing the area covered by these leads is a key issue in cell design, as the lead blocks sunlight from reaching parts of the cell surface and thus reduces potential energy output. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) estimated in 2011 that a manufacturing plant to produce 120 megawatts (MW) of cells per year would require an investment of around $40 million. Module M anufacturing. Modules, which normally weigh 34 to 62 pounds, are created by mounting 60 to 72 cells on a plastic backing within a frame, usually made of aluminum. Chinese manufacturers have come to dominate module manufacturing, making up about 70% of the total global production in 2013. The module is covered by a special solar glass, which protects the unit against the elements and maximizes the efficiency of the unit that coverts sunlight into power. Production of solar glass is highly capital intensive, and approximately 60% of the global market is controlled by four manufacturers: Ashai, NSG Group (Pilkington), Saint Gobain, and Guardian. The glass is expensive to ship, so glass producers tend to locate near module manufacturers. In some countries, module manufacturing is highly automated; in others, more labor-intensive processes are used.", "A newer technology, thin-film PV, accounts for about 20% of total solar PV production. Rather than using polysilicon, these cells use thin layers of semiconductor materials like amorphous silicon (a-Si), copper indium diselenide (CIS), copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS), or cadmium telluride (CdTe). The manufacturing methods are similar to those used in producing flat panel displays for computer monitors, mobile phones, and televisions: a thin photoactive film is deposited on a substrate, which can be either glass or a transparent film. Afterwards, the film is structured into cells. Unlike crystalline modules, thin-film modules are manufactured in a single step. Thin-film systems are usually less costly to produce than crystalline silicon systems, but have substantially lower efficiency rates. On average, thin-film cells convert 5%-13% of incoming sunlight into electricity, compared to 12%-21% for crystalline silicon modules. Looking ahead, relatively newer thin-film technology may offer greater opportunities for technological improvement. In the United States, First Solar is the largest thin-film panel manufacturer, with an annual production capacity of 280 MW.", "Crystalline silicon systems and thin-film systems all make use of a variety of other components, known as \"balance of system\" equipment. These include batteries (used to store solar energy for use when the sun is not shining), charge controllers, circuit breakers, meters, switch gear, mounting hardware, power-conditioning equipment, and wiring. In the United States, inverters are also needed to convert the electricity generated from direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC) electricity compatible with the electric grid. Usually, balance of system components are not made by the system manufacturers, but are sourced from external suppliers.", "Similar to many other advanced manufacturing industries, solar panel manufacturing depends on a global supply chain (see Figure 1 ), with PV manufacturers sourcing products at each stage of the value chain from suppliers located anywhere in the world. For instance, PV manufacturers purchase the majority of their solar factory equipment for wafer, cell, and module production from European and U.S. firms such as Roth & Rau (Germany), Applied Materials (United States), GT Solar (United States), and Oerlikon Solar (Switzerland). As an example, a system produced by the U.S. firm SunPower may include wafers from its AUO joint venture partner in Malaysia, cells manufactured at its factory in the Philippines, and modules from its assembly facilities in Mexico or France.", "Each solar panel assembler uses different sourcing strategies, and the levels of vertical integration vary across the industry. At one extreme, SolarWorld, based in Germany, is highly integrated, controlling every stage from the raw material silicon to delivery of a utility-scale solar power plant. At the other extreme, some large manufacturers are pure-play cell companies, purchasing polysilicon wafers from outside vendors and selling most or all of their production to module assemblers. A number of solar manufacturers seem to be moving toward greater vertical integration for better control of the entire manufacturing process. Vertical integration also reduces the risk of bottlenecks holding up delivery of the final product.", "Labor costs account for less than 10% of production costs for U.S. solar cell and module producers. According to Suntech, a Chinese module manufacturer, labor makes up 3%-4% of the cost of making crystalline solar panels. A 2011 study by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) reported that even the more labor-intensive module assembly process is being automated, and that module assembly in China and the United States uses similar levels of automation. International transport costs for finished modules are also small, in the range of 1%-3% of value, producers have told the ITC.", "Production and transportation costs do not appear to be the major considerations in determining where manufacturing facilities are located. In 2011, according to a National Renewable Energy Laboratory presentation, Chinese producers had an inherent cost advantage of no greater than 1% compared with U.S. producers; in the U.S. market, China suffered a 5% cost disadvantage before the imposition of antidumping and countervailing duties in 2012 and 2015."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Production Locations", "paragraphs": ["With neither labor costs nor transportation costs being decisive, many manufacturers that opened new facilities over the past decade chose to locate them in countries with strong demand\u2014which generally have been countries with attractive incentives for PV installations.

Together, they comprised about two-thirds of the world's PV installed capacity of nearly 139 GW in 2013. Since 2011, a number of European governments have reduced solar incentives such as feed-in tariffs (FITs), which require utilities to purchase renewable power at generous rates. These policy changes contributed to lower demand for solar PV installations in Europe, adversely affecting European solar manufacturing. In Germany, for example, the market decreased significantly. In 2013, 40 companies manufactured 1,230 MW of PV cells and modules, compared with 62 PV companies with production of about 2,700 MW in 2008. The Japanese government has sustained its domestic solar PV market by offering various inducements, which include a feed-in tariff, tax incentives, and direct grants for solar PV.

China followed up with countervailing duties on U.S. polysilicon of up to 6.5%.

In the 113 th Congress, the Renewable Energy Parity Act of 2014 ( S. 2003 ) was introduced by Senators Michael Bennet and Dean Heller to make firms eligible for tax credits for projects that are already under construction before the credit's expiration date, instead of having to wait until those projects are competed and in service. More than two dozen Members of Congress have voiced their support for modifying the construction qualification to the solar investment tax credit to ensure that solar projects underway will come to fruition.

However, although the per-watt cost of solar PV systems has declined significantly, in most areas of the country solar power is still not competitive with power generated from fossil fuels. The cost disadvantage could widen if subsidies are unavailable or if retail electricity prices decline due to the lower price of natural gas.

In 1839, a French physicist, Alexandre Edmond Becquerel, discovered the photovoltaic effect, and in 1883, an American inventor, Charles Fritts, made the first primitive solar cell. Progress in modern solar cell manufacturing began in the 1940s and 1950s when Russell Ohl discovered that a rod of silicon with impurities created an electric voltage when illuminated and three scientists at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey (Daryl Chapin, Calvin Fuller, and Gerald Pearson) developed the first commercial photovoltaic cell. ", "Further advancing PV cell manufacturing was the space race of the 1960s, with the competition between the United States and the former Soviet Union driving demand for solar cells, which were, and still are, used to power some spacecraft and satellites. The first generation of photovoltaic manufacturing firms included such names as Hoffman Electronics, Heliotek, RCA, International Rectifier, and Texas Instruments. The technology, however, remained too expensive for other uses, and the market remained very small. The Japanese manufacturer Sharp pioneered the use of photovoltaics on earth, using them to power hundreds of lighthouses along the Japanese coast, but it could not identify other applications for which photovoltaics were cost-competitive.", "The oil crises of the 1970s hastened the development of modern solar panels by a second generation of PV firms, which focused on ground applications. Major oil and gas companies entered the field. Exxon underwrote the Solar Power Corporation. Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) purchased Solar Technology International and renamed it ARCO Solar in 1977; its corporate descendant is now part of SolarWorld, presently the largest cell manufacturer in the United States. First Solar, one of the biggest manufacturers of PV thin-film cells, can trace its roots to Toledo, OH, where it was established in 1984 as Glasstech Solar.", "The first direct federal support for solar manufacturing was during the Carter Administration. The Energy Tax Act (ETA) of 1978 provided tax credits for homeowners who invested in solar and certain other technologies. Additionally, the federal government through the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act required utilities to purchase power produced by qualified renewable power facilities. ", "Notwithstanding this support, production of solar PV power in the United States remained small. By the mid-1980s, domestic photovoltaic manufacturers were selling products at a loss, and many were struggling. President Reagan's Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) to 10% in 1988, where it remained until 2005. Because of these policy changes, combined with the sustained drop in petroleum prices, solar manufacturing slumped until 2005, when President George W. Bush signed the Energy Policy Act (EPAct). That law included a 30% ITC for property owners who installed commercial and residential solar energy systems."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
