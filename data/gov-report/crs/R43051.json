{"id": "R43051", "title": "The Administrative Process by Which Groups May Be Acknowledged as Indian Tribes by the Department of the Interior", "released_date": "2014-05-28T00:00:00", "summary": ["In 1978, the Department of the Interior (Department) adopted a final rule setting forth the process by which a group may be recognized (also acknowledged) as an Indian tribe by the Department. Prior to that time, the Department made decisions on an ad hoc basis. However, in the wake of the treaty fishing rights case United States v. Washington and eastern land claims, more groups started seeking recognition as Indian tribes, and the Department could no longer manage the recognition requests on a case-by-case basis. The acknowledgement process, codified in 25 C.F.R. Part 83, sets forth a uniform process and uniform criteria for acknowledging that groups exist as Indian tribes.", "The key to federal acknowledgment under the current regulations is continuous political existence of an Indian group from historical times to the present. The federal acknowledgment process does not create tribes, and it does not give groups sovereignty. Rather, it acknowledges a political entity that already exists. To do this, 25 C.F.R. Section 83.7 provides seven mandatory criteria that groups must satisfy in order to establish that they exist and have existed as an autonomous political entity. First, in order to be acknowledged, a group must establish that it has been identified as an Indian entity from 1900 to the present. Second, it must establish that it has existed as a community from historical times to the present. Third, it must establish that it has exercised political control over its members from historical times to the present. Fourth, the group must provide a copy of its governing document, including membership criteria. Fifth, the group must establish that its members descend from a historical Indian tribe or historical Indian tribes that combined and functioned as a single autonomous political entity. Sixth, the membership must be composed principally of persons who are not members of a federally recognized tribe. Finally, the group must establish that it is not the subject of congressional legislation terminating or forbidding the federal-tribal relationship.", "The current regulations assign responsibility to the Assistant Secretary\u2014Indian Affairs (Assistant Secretary) to issue initial proposed findings and then final determinations. The Office of Federal Acknowledgment (OFA) makes recommendations to the Assistant Secretary on the proposed findings and the final determinations. A final determination may be appealed on limited grounds to the Interior Board of Indian Appeals.", "Acknowledgment as an Indian tribe means that the group becomes a federally recognized tribe with which the United States has a government-to-government relationship. This relationship makes the tribe and its members eligible for certain benefits, as well as subject to certain protections. It also means that the tribe may exercise jurisdiction over its territory and members generally free from state law, subject to limitations of federal law.", "After years of criticism of the acknowledgment process, the Department of the Interior has proposed several changes to the acknowledgment regulations. First, the proposed rule would change some of the criteria. Second, the proposed rule would assign responsibility for the proposed findings to OFA but keep responsibility for the final determinations with the Assistant Secretary. In rendering the proposed finding, OFA would consider the criteria in stages. Petitioners could appeal a negative proposed finding at any of the stages. The appeal would be heard by a judge within the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) who would issue a recommended decision for the Assistant Secretary to consider in issuing the final determination. The Assistant Secretary's decision would be final for the Department."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In the 19 th century and first half of the 20 th century, the federal government made determinations about which groups of Indians were tribes on an ad hoc basis when negotiating treaties and determining which groups of Indians could reorganize their governments under the Indian Reorganization Act. In the 1970s, the number of requests for tribal recognition by the Department of the Interior (Department) increased exponentially in the wake of the decisions in United States v. Washington , which recognized tribal treaty fishing rights in the Pacific Northwest, and Joint Tribal Council of Passamaquoddy v. Morton , which recognized a tribal land claim on the East Coast. Faced with many requests for tribal recognition, in 1978, the Department adopted a uniform process and uniform criteria for considering whether a group should be acknowledged as an Indian tribe.", "Acknowledgment or recognition as an Indian tribe has important legal and practical significance. One scholar on tribal acknowledgment explains the significance of tribal recognition as follows:", "An administrative determination that a group is a tribe (i.e., that it merits federal acknowledgment or recognition) establishes a government-to-government relationship between it and the United States. A positive determination under the regulations means that the group has inherent sovereign authority independent of the state in which it is located and independent of the United States, although it remains a domestic dependent nation. A group acknowledged under the regulations has continuously existed throughout history. A tribe, consequently, has sovereign immunity and may exercise jurisdiction over its territory and establish tribal courts, administer funds under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, establish gaming facilities under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, bring a land claim under the Indian Trade and non-Intercourse Act, exercise treaty hunting and fishing rights, and obtain other federal benefits and exercise their own sovereign authority, except as limited by federal law. General prohibitions or limitations also apply to federally recognized tribes. For example, possession of liquor is prohibited in Indian country absent publication of a certified liquor ordinance, and the sale of land is limited. Thus, a determination that a group is or is not a tribe is a decision with significant impacts on the group itself, federal and state governments, other Indian tribes, and non-Indians."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Acknowledgment Process", "paragraphs": ["The process set forth in 25 C.F.R.

Therefore, groups that recently came together and \"[s]plinter groups, political factions, communities or groups of any character that separate from the main body of a currently acknowledged tribe\" may not be acknowledged. Groups that were subject to congressional termination may not use the process to be acknowledged. Finally, groups that have been through the process and failed may not re-petition for acknowledgment.", "The acknowledgment process begins when a group files a letter of intent, signed by the governing body of the group, requesting that the group be acknowledged.
