In the last several years, ATF has become embroiled in several controversies related to its mishandling of firearms-related criminal investigations, such as a Southwest border gun trafficking operation that allowed hundreds of firearms to be smuggled to Mexico and an undercover store front operation in Wisconsin that allegedly involved the exploitation of disabled individuals in minority communities. ", "Gun control advocates, conversely, maintain that Congress has not provided ATF with adequate funding and has placed undue conditions on the funding it has provided the agency. As discussed in this report, ATF's FY2016 budget justification asserts that the agency does not have enough resources to monitor the firearms industry, nor conduct routine firearms traces for other law enforcement agencies. As one option, Congress may want to assess whether ATF is properly balancing its administrative (regulatory) and enforcement missions, given recent decreases in firearms-related violent crime and ongoing budget constraints. As Ta b le 1 shows, for FY2016, Congress appropriated $1.24 billion for ATF in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 ( P.L. 114-113 ).

Those challenges include the following:", "1. future attrition and retirement of ATF special agents and support staff; 2. maintaining productivity in the face of increased workloads in both areas, ATF \"law enforcement operations\" and \"investigative support services\"; and 3. an urgent need to provide accurate intelligence data and to expand law enforcement capabilities to combat violent crime, including active/mass shooter incidents.", "As shown in Table 2 , the Administration requested $1.261 billion for ATF for FY2016, an increase of 5.3%. This proposed net increase of $63.4 million over ATF's FY2015 appropriation included $8.1 million to \"address deficiencies in Investigative Support Services.\" These deficiencies, according to ATF, are the result of increased application workloads under the National Firearms Act (NFA) of 1934 and increased firearms trace requests under the Gun Control Act (GCA) of 1968. It also included $30.2 million for \"staffing restoration\" and $25.1 million in other \"base adjustments.\"", " Table 2 also shows breakouts for the ATF FY2015 enacted budget, FY2016 base budget (current services), and FY2016 request by two budget decision units. Those decision units include \"law enforcement operations (LEO)\" and \"investigative support services (ISS).\" These two budget decision units include the amounts of resources and staff allocated to the agency's enforcement and regulatory operations, respectively. ATF adopted this budget decision unit structure during the FY2015 budget request and appropriations cycle. ", "Prior to the FY2015 budget decision unit realignment, the ATF budget structure included three budget decision units: (1) firearms, (2) explosives and arson, and (3) alcohol and tobacco. While not shown in Table 2 , the majority of resources in terms of dollars, positions, and full-time equivalents (FTE) were and are still allocated principally for firearms-related enforcement and regulatory operations. In prior years, those operations accounted for over three-quarters of the ATF budget. Arson and Explosives accounted for one-fifth of the ATF budget.", " Table 2 and Table 3 also show that the anticipated FY2015 FTE level funded through appropriations was 4,880 and the requested FY2016 FTE level was 5,106, or a net increase of 226 FTEs. Table 2 and Table 3 show the permanent positions associated with the funded FTE, of which five FTEs were associated with the requested additional 10 permanent positions for FY2016. The $30.2 million for \"staffing restoration\" included funding to \"restore\" another 221 FTEs not associated with new positions, for a net increase of 226 FTE, but only 10 permanent positions. According to ATF, the need to restore the 221 FTEs was exacerbated by a three-year, DOJ-wide hiring freeze. ", "The $25.1 million for \"base adjustments\" essentially represented the estimated level of resources that ATF projects would be needed for upcoming fiscal year (FY2016) to provide the same level of services that it anticipated providing during the current fiscal year (FY2015).", "In addition, for FY2016, the Administration requested that ATF's authority to participate in a personnel management demonstration project be terminated. This demonstration project had allowed ATF to provide some employees with retention pay to compensate them for pay caps that are otherwise required under federal law. In lieu of the demonstration project, ATF sought permanent legislative authority to compensate several employees without a reduction in pay. Section 206 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 ( P.L. 114-113 ) provides ATF with that requested authority.", " Table 4 shows ATF permanent positions by selected Office of Personnel Management (OPM) job series for fiscal years 2012-2015, for which Congress appropriated funding, and the Administration's FY2016 request. For example, special agents (criminal investigators\u2014OPM job series 1811), who are authorized to make arrests and carry firearms, accounted for nearly half of the permanent positions under the FY2016 request. Industry Operations Investigators (inspectors\u2014OPM job series 1801), who are not authorized to make arrests or carry a firearm, accounted for 16.3% of the permanent positions under the FY2016 request. Besides a FY2013 reduction, the level of funded positions for these two job series discussed above has not changed. According to ATF, the FY2013 reduction in permanent positions was due to sequestration and the three-year DOJ hiring freeze noted above. The level of funded positions for Intelligence Analysts (OPM job series 132) and Attorneys (OPM job series 905) has also remained level, but those job series did not see an FY2013 reduction. Nor did \"other\" positions see an FY2013 reduction.

The Administration, moreover, has maintained that the ATF has been hamstrung by appropriations limitations listed in the Appendix to this report, an increase in the number of FFLs, and a surge in firearms-related commerce. For FY2014, for example, ATF reported that it could only conduct 10,000 FFL compliance inspections, a 24% decrease from the previous year, and only 7% of the FFL population. ", "Meanwhile, for FY2015, ATF reports that it has allocated $1.014 billion (84.6%) of its $1.198 billion appropriation under its \"law enforcement operations\" budget decision unit. ATF proposes allocating a similar percentage (84.4%) for FY2016 for this budget decision unit. This means that less than 16% of ATF appropriated funding would be allocated for its other budget decision unit, \"investigative support services,\" which funds other mission-critical activities, including FFL qualification and compliance inspections, administrative actions, and firearms traces, as well as other firearms and explosives regulatory efforts. ", "While ATF has traditionally allocated a greater share of its resources towards its enforcement mission over its regulatory (administrative) mission, the emphasis on enforcement over administration might have arguably been increased by ATF's transfer from the Department of the Treasury to DOJ. If firearms-related violent crime should continue to decrease nationally, Congress could consider whether ATF should allocate a greater share of its resources towards it regulatory mission, particularly the monitoring of FFLs and explosives licensees and permittees. ", "In addition, Figure 1 illustrates the net annual increase in the U.S. civilian gun stock, which has fluctuated over the 32-year period (1980-2011). Nevertheless, in 2003, the net annual increase in the U.S. civilian gun stock was a little less than 5 million additional firearms. Since 2003, the net annual increase has generally grown. By 2011, the net annual increase in the civilian gun stock was more than 9 million firearms.

Federally licensed gun dealers are commonly referred to as federal firearms licensees, or FFLs. The GCA prohibits the interstate mail-order transfer of all firearms and interstate transfer of handguns generally (except by FFLs). It sets forth categories of persons to whom firearms or ammunition may not be sold, such as persons under a specified age or with criminal records. It also requires FFLs to maintain records of all commercial gun sales.", "Although the United States does not maintain a registry of firearms or firearm owners (except for NFA weapons, like machineguns, short-barreled shotguns, and silencers), under ATF direction, FFLs maintain a decentralized system of transaction records, through which ATF can sometimes trace a firearm from its manufacturer or importer to its first private owner of record. Over the years, successful firearm traces have generated leads in criminal investigations and have generated data that illustrate wider illegal trafficking trends and patterns. During 2004, ATF processed about 259,000 trace requests. During FY2012, ATF processed about 341,000 trace requests for domestic and international law enforcement agencies. ", "The release of raw, unfiltered firearms trace data to the public has been the source of controversy in the past, especially when the identities of federally licensed gun dealers who might not have broken any law are released. Congress has placed a limitation on ATF concerning the release of firearms trace data through legislative language in the salaries and expenses account and in a stand-alone provision that requires ATF to include data caveats in any trace data reports.

Yet homicide rates, whether with or without firearms, were lower from about 1999 through 2013 than they were in 1968. During the same years, estimated firearms-related robberies and aggravated assaults have decreased similarly. If violent crime committed with firearms should continue to trend downward, Congress could consider whether ATF should allocate greater resources towards its regulatory mission as one cost-saving measure.

Based on the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports and Supplementary Homicide Reports (UCR-SHR), BJS estimated that there were 987 four or more victim homicide incidents from 1980 to 2011, or an average 31 incidents per year. While the bulk of those incidents were mass murders, it is probable that some of those incidents were serial murders committed over extended time periods, or spree murders that lasted longer than roughly 24 hours.

Duwe observed:", "The mass murders that often capture the public's imagination are those in which an offender publically guns down victims for no apparent rhyme or reason. Of the 250 incidents that took place from 1900 through 1999, 191 involved offenders who used firearms. Excluding those that occurred in connection with criminal activity such as robbery, drug dealing, and organized crime, there were 116 mass public shootings during the twentieth century.", "Duwe defined mass public shooting as \"any incident in which four or more victims are killed publicly in a workplace, school, restaurant, or other public place with guns and within 24 hours.\" ", "With data provided by Duwe, CRS also compiled a 44-year (1970-2013) dataset of firearms-related mass murders that could arguably be characterized as \"mass public shootings.\" These data show that there were on average:", "one (1.1) incident per year during the 1970s (5.5 victims murdered, 2.0 wounded per incident), nearly three (2.7) incidents per year during the 1980s (6.1 victims murdered, 5.3 wounded per incident), four (4.0) incidents per year during the 1990s (5.6 victims murdered, 5.5 wounded per incident), four (4.1) incidents per year during the 2000s (6.4 victims murdered, 4.0 wounded per incident), and four (4.5) incidents per year from 2010 through 2013 (7.4 victims murdered, 6.3 wounded per incident).", "These decade-long averages suggest that the prevalence, if not the deadliness, of \"mass public shootings\" increased in the 1970s and 1980s, and continued to increase, but not as steeply, during the 1990s, 2000s, and first four years of the 2010s.", "As one possible oversight issue, Members of Congress could query ATF as to how it proposes to address \"mass shootings\" through leveraging its core law enforcement competencies.
