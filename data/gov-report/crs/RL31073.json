The dollars involved are significant, and considerations of \"winner\" and \"loser\" states bear heavily on discussions of policy choices reflected in alternative formulations. This is likely to be the case again, when Congress considers legislation to reauthorize the act. Because the current allocation formula is now more than 25 years old, while needs and population have changed, the issue of how to allocate state-by-state distribution of federal funds remains an important topic. In May 2016, EPA issued a report requested by Congress on the allotment of CWA water infrastructure funding. It concludes that, for the majority of states, the current allotment does not adequately reflect reported water quality needs or the most recent Census data on population. It provides several possible options to update the allotment in the future, but does not recommend or identify a preferred option."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Congress established a statutory formula governing distribution of financial aid for municipal wastewater treatment in the Clean Water Act (CWA) in 1972.

Congress has appropriated more than $91 billion since 1972. The formula originally applied to the act's program of grants for constructing such projects. That grants program was replaced in the law in 1987 by a new program of federal grants to capitalize state revolving loan funds (SRFs) for similar activities.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in consultation with states, has prepared 15 clean water needs surveys since then to provide information to policymakers on the nation's total funding needs, as well as needs for certain types of projects. Legislation to fund water infrastructure projects has been on Congress's agenda regularly since the 107 th Congress.

These amendments did not modify the existing allotment formula, but requested EPA to conduct a review of the current allotment formula and submit a report to Congress.

Two types of trends and institutional preferences can be discerned in these actions. First, there are differences over the use of need and population factors in the allocation formula itself. During the 1970s, the Senate strongly favored reliance on use of population factors in the allocation formula, while the House strongly advocated a needs-based approach. During the 1980s, the period when categorical eligibilities were restricted in order to emphasize water quality benefits, the Senate favored needs as the basis for grants distribution, while the House position generally was to retain formulas used in prior years, which incorporate both needs and population elements. When population has been used as a factor, differences have occurred over whether a current or future year population estimate is appropriate, but there is no clear trend on this point.", "Second, until recently, there have been gradual increases in restrictions on types of wastewater treatment projects eligible for federal assistance. Beginning with a limitation that denied use of federal funds for stormwater sewer projects in 1977, debate over categorical eligibility has had two elements. One has been fiscal: a desire to not fund types of projects with the highest costs and often the most unreliable cost estimates. The other focus has been environmental: a desire to use federal resources to assist projects which benefit water quality protection most directly. While some of these eligibility restrictions presented Congress with rather straightforward choices, others have been more complex. Some continue to be debated, such as whether certain types of projects should be fully eligible for federal aid or should be the responsibility of state and local governments. The 2014 CWA amendments enacted as part of WRRDA revised the list of project categories that are SRF-eligible to include some that have been eligible by practice, such as stormwater management and treatment, and to identify newly-eligible categories, such as decentralized wastewater treatment systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Formula and Other Changes", "paragraphs": ["The following table provides a generalized summary of the components of the allocation formula since 1972.

In the 2000 survey, needs for these types of projects were an additional $14 billion.

The formula also included a hold harmless provision, under which no state would receive less in construction grant funds than it was allotted under the previous formula.", "Use of the partial needs categories was based on EPA's recommendation to the Congress that the allocation formula should only include the costs of providing treatment works to achieve secondary treatment (the basic national treatment requirement mandated in the 1972 act), treatment more stringent than secondary as required by water quality standards, and eligible new interceptor sewers, force mains, and pumping stations (categories I, II, and IVB, respectively). These were the core categories representing projects to comply with the basic water quality objectives of the Clean Water Act.

In addition, some States found that under the needs concept they would receive less than they had previously when funds were allocated on the basis of population. The primary reason for this appears to be that these States have not yet accurately identified their true needs for wastewater treatment facilities.", "The committee is very much committed to the allocation of funds on the basis of need.

In response, the next wastewater needs survey (the 1974 survey) was transmitted to Congress in February 1975. Based on that survey, EPA recommended that future formulas focus on needs reported for categories I, II, and IVB.

The House has twice passed reauthorization bills (in 2007 and 2009), but none has received further action.", "Allotment formula issues were again under consideration in the 111 th Congress, but no legislation was enacted. H.R. 1262 , passed by the House in March 2009, and S. 1005 , approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in May 2009, would have revised the current allotment for clean water SRF monies, but in different ways. The House bill would have extended the current formula in full for two years. Under that legislation, beginning in the third year and thereafter, distribution would be determined under a hybrid approach: for appropriated funds up to $1.35 billion, the current formula would apply, and for appropriated funds in excess of that amount, allotment would be done in accordance with funding needs as reported in the most recent clean water needs survey conducted by EPA and states.", "The Senate bill in the 111 th Congress proposed a new state-by-state allotment for clean water SRF capitalization grants that was based on the 2004 needs survey (which was the survey available at the time of the committee's consideration). The revised formula in S. 1005 included certain adjustments, for example, guaranteeing small states a minimum 0.75% share (rather than 0.5% as under current law), and generally insuring that no state would \"gain\" more than 50% compared with its current percentage share or \"lose\" more than 25% compared with its current allotment. ", "In 1996, Congress amended the Safe Drinking Water Act and established a drinking water state revolving loan fund program modeled after the clean water SRF. However, in that act ( P.L. 104-182 ), Congress took a different approach from that in the CWA and directed that drinking water SRF capitalization grants be allotted among the states by EPA based on the proportional share of each state's needs identified in the most recent national drinking water needs survey, not according to a statutory allotment formula.", "While the clean water and drinking water SRFs represent significant amounts of federal financial assistance, Congress has provided other assistance, as well, in the form of grants earmarked in EPA appropriations acts for specific communities, both small and large. For a number of years, congressional appropriators had dedicated a portion of annual water infrastructure assistance as earmarked special project grants which are not subject to any statutory or other allotment formula. For example, for FY2010 ( P.L. 111-88 ), Congress appropriated $2.1 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants, $1.4 billion for drinking water SRF capitalization grants, and $187 million in earmarked grants for projects in 319 designated communities or areas. Since the first of these earmarks in EPA appropriations in FY1989, Congress provided $7.5 billion for special project grants. Congress imposed a moratorium on earmarking in FY2011, but could restore it in the future.

For example, EPA's analysis found that the current formula adequately reflects the water quality needs for only 17 states, compared with an allotment based on the most recent needs survey. Similarly, the current formula reflects the water quality needs for only 14 states, compared with an allotment calculated using 2010 population data. The report provides several possible options for updating the allocation formula, without recommendation, based on needs survey data, population data, and other elements, such as the extent of a state's reported water quality impairment. Some of the options described in the EPA report include \"hold harmless\" factors that could constrain potential percentage decreases or increases in funding to individual states."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Expansion of Categorical Eligibilities in 2014", "paragraphs": ["Because the CWA SRF program is the principal source of federal financial assistance for wastewater infrastructure projects, pressure has grown to expand the categories eligible under the program to include additional types needed by communities to meet a wider range of water quality objectives. Congress responded to these concerns in the CWA amendments that were included in WRRDA 2014. These amendments did not modify the existing state-by-state allotment formula or reauthorize SRF capitalization grant funds, but they revised the statutory list of SRF-eligible projects to expressly include some types of projects that have been SRF-eligible by practice (such as measures to manage, reduce, treat, or recapture stormwater; wastewater facility security projects; and reusing or recycling wastewater or stormwater), as well as a number of newly identified categories that now may be assisted by an SRF. These include\u2014", "decentralized wastewater treatment projects (e.g., individual onsite systems), measures to reduce demand for wastewater treatment works capacity through water conservation or reuse, or to reduce the energy consumption needs of wastewater treatment works, development and implementation of watershed projects, and assistance to small and medium wastewater treatment facilities to develop and obtain project financing and to assist such facilities in complying with the CWA (assistance recipients must be a nonprofit entity).", "Arguably, these less-traditional types of projects could benefit water quality protection and improvement, as do traditional infrastructure investments, and supporting them through the SRF would help ensure comparatively secure funding. But expanding the scope of eligibility also arguably dilutes the historic focus of the CWA SRF program, at a time when needs for core projects\u2014wastewater treatment facilities and sewers\u2014are estimated to be more than $195 billion."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Since adoption of the allocation formula that has governed distribution of Clean Water Act assistance since 1987, EPA and the states have produced seven updated needs surveys (in 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2012). In addition, updated population information became available through three subsequent decennial Censuses (in 1990, 2000, and 2010). Although population changes have occurred during that time, and needs for water quality projects also have changed (total needs increased 17% between the 2004 and 2008 surveys, but decreased 20% between the 2008 and 2012 surveys), none of this more recent information is reflected in the currently applicable distribution formula. The recent needs surveys have included estimates of needs for traditional wastewater project categories, but they also have included estimates for newer categories, such as stormwater management\u2014now identified separately from combined sewer overflow correction\u2014recycled water distribution, and decentralized wastewater treatment systems (e.g., onsite and clustered community systems often found in rural areas).", "Crafting an allotment formula has been one of the most controversial issues debated during reauthorization of the Clean Water Act. The dollars involved are significant, and considerations of \"winner\" and \"loser\" states bear heavily on discussions of policy choices reflected in alternative formulations. This is likely to be the case again, when Congress reauthorizes the wastewater infrastructure funding portions of the act. In part because the current allocation formula is now more than 25 years old, the issue of how to allocate state-by-state distribution of federal funds remains an important topic of interest to policymakers and state and local officials."], "subsections": []}]}}
