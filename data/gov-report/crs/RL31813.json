Charter schools are public schools that operate independently of traditional local public schoolsystems under a charter granted by a public entity. The 104th Congress authorized theestablishment of charter schools in the District of Columbia, under the District ofColumbia School Reform Act of 1995 ( P.L. 104-134 ). Under the District ofColumbia's charter school law, charters may be granted by either the District ofColumbia Board of Education or the District of Columbia Public Charter SchoolBoard. In accordance with requirements implemented under P.L. 104-134 , bothDCPS schools and public charter schools are funded on a per-pupil basis accordingto a uniform per student funding formula (UPSFF).

The Act appropriated $16.9 million for charter school activities,including $8 million for a credit enhancement revolving fund, and $5 million for afacilities improvement fund. In addition, the act established the Office of PublicCharter School Financing and Support and amended the District of Columbia SchoolReform Act of 1995 to establish the Charter School Fund. The act also included aprovision directing the General Accounting Office to provide a detailed analysis ofDistrict and nationwide efforts to establish adequate charter schools facilities. (16) These provisions were intended to address major issues confronting charter schoolsin the city -- finding, financing, and renovating adequate facilities. ", "For FY2004, District officials have requested $6 million in federal special payments for charter schools. The House version of H.R. 2765 did notinclude any additional funding for District of Columbia charter schools for FY2004. The Senate version of the District of Columbia Appropriations Act would provide$13 million for public charter schools in the District of Columbia as part of a $40million federal payment for school improvement. (17) The charter school componentincludes $8 million for the Direct Loans Fund for Charter School Improvementestablished under P.L. 108-7 and $5 million for a new \"City Build\" charter schoolinitiative.

In its FY2004 budget submission, the Bush Administration requested $75 million for aChoice Incentive Fund that would provide competitive awards to states, localeducational agencies (LEAs), and community based organizations (CBOs) thatexpanded opportunities for parents of children who attend low-performing schoolsto attend higher-performing public schools (including charter schools) and privateschools. Under the administration's proposal, a portion would be reserved for schoolchoice programs in the District of Columbia. ", "On May 1, 2003, Mayor Anthony Williams endorsed a Bush Administration school choice initiative intended to provide scholarships to assist eligible Districtschoolchildren to attend private elementary and secondary schools. The mayor'sendorsement followed that of Peggy Cafritz, President of the District of ColumbiaBoard of Education, who announced her support for vouchers in a Washington Post editorial on March 29, 2003. (18) The mayorand board of education president endorsedthe concept of private school vouchers as a means of improving educational optionsfor District public-school children and transforming the city's faltering publicschools. Local supporters of a voucher program insist that it must be federallyfunded and must not reduce funding for the city's traditional public schools andpublic charter schools. ", "The mayor's support of a voucher program has been criticized by the city's Delegate to Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton, who characterized the BushAdministration proposal as an affront to home rule. (19) Opponents of the voucherprogram contend that it will drain needed funds from public education and will be ofminimal benefit to the majority of District school children. While the U.S. SupremeCourt has ruled in Zelman v. Simmons-Harris that the Constitution permits publicfunding of school vouchers for attendance at religiously affiliated schools ininstances where parents have the opportunity of selecting from a range of options thatincludes public and private secular schools, many still object to allowing public fundsto be used to pay tuition for attendance at religiously affiliated schools.

(22) On September 5, 2003,during floor debate on H.R.2765, the House considered two school voucher-related amendments to thebill. Delegate Norton introduced H.Amdt. 367 , which would havedeleted from the bill the proposed $10 million to fund the school choice program. The amendment failed to pass by a vote of 203 to 203 (Roll Call Vote No. 479). TheHouse approved by a vote of 209 to 206 (Roll Call Vote No. 490) an amendmentoffered by Representative Tom Davis.

It would authorize a five-year school choice program in the District ofColumbia. It would prevent entities participating in the program from discriminatingagainst participants and applicants on the basis of race, color, national origin,religion, or sex, but would allow for single-sex schools operated by religiousorganizations as long as single-sex schools are consistent with the religious tenets orbeliefs of the school.
