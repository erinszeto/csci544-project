", "Policy considerations not only affect how the fees are set, but also who should pay. In the case of USCIS, these policy considerations can conflict with each other. For instance, while the agency pursues revenue adequacy as a goal, it nevertheless does not collect fees from asylees and refugees on humanitarian grounds. Similarly, USCIS aims for equity in establishing fee levels, but when attempting to adjust fees for naturalization petitions on par with other petition fee adjustments, it confronts a vocal immigration advocacy community as well as its own broader policy objectives to foster citizenship.

Going back earlier, GAO noted that when the 3 million individuals who legalized under IRCA in 1986 became eligible for naturalization in 1995, the application backlog increased markedly. Processing backlogs may affect processing times for other petitions as resources within the agency are reconfigured to address urgent needs.

Since it was announced in November, the agency has made plans to hire over 1,000 full and part-time personnel to handle the workload.

Such delays underscore both the agency's limited personnel resources and its continued reliance on a largely paper-based system.", "In addition to these issues, immigration observers continue to express concerns over several perennial issues related to USCIS. The most frequently cited concern involves fee levels. Some evidence suggests that the current naturalization petition fee, in particular, poses a barrier to individuals wishing to become U.S. citizens, a critical step toward political and civic incorporation. While immigrant advocacy groups argue that lower fees would increase the numbers of LPRs who naturalize, USCIS has not signaled any plans to adjust its fee structure to address this concern beyond maintaining the naturalization petition fee at its current level.", "Appendix A. History of USCIS Fee Funding", "In its original version, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (INA) prescribed fees for certain immigration services. Furthermore, a general \"user\" statute in Title V of the Independent Offices Appropriations Act of 1952 granted government agencies the authorization to charge fees for services performed. Legislation in 1968 removed the enumeration of statutory fees under the INA, and subsequently immigration fees were prescribed in regulations under the authorization of the latter \"user\" statute.", "Following the 1968 legislation, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) continued to periodically adjust fees as it deemed necessary. However, the second term of the Reagan Administration saw more concerted efforts to make INS adjudication functions fee-reliant. At the same time that Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), which included a legalization program for certain unlawfully present aliens, the INS decreased fees for stays of deportation but increased them for certain other deportation-related motions. In the publication of the final fee schedule after passage of IRCA, the agency stated that it believed it was legally required to recover all of its costs for services it provided. The 1987 amendment to the fee schedule added fees for the legalization program under IRCA, and despite opposition to the $185 filing fee, the INS maintained the charge was needed to ensure the program was self-funding. ", "In 1988, Congress mandated the creation of the Immigration Exam Fee Account (IEFA) in the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1989, such that the funding for the legalization fees could be isolated and a portion of those fees retained by the agency. These fees would then be available to the INS to recover some of the costs associated with providing immigration services. The following fiscal year, the IEFA was amended in the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1990, giving INS the authority to retain and expend all of the adjudication fees collected. The purpose of this change was that funding for the Adjudications and Naturalization Program of the INS would be financed solely through this mechanism. ", "Following the passage of the Immigration Act of 1990, the INS experienced a period of unprecedented growth in applications and petitions for immigration services. This growth was further compounded in 1995 when approximately 3 million individuals who had legalized under IRCA became eligible to naturalize. ", "At roughly the same time, GAO released a report on the financial practices of the INS that found inadequate controls over fee funding and vulnerability to fraud and other abuses. GAO also found that despite a large increase in fee funding, the agency suffered from inadequate service processing times and weak leadership and management. The INS responded to this report through centralization initiatives and by stating that its new fee schedule of 1991 would reduce the growing applications backlog. Yet, by 1993 observers expressed growing concerns that increased fees had not yielded the promised performance improvements. Some asserted that the INS was using a portion of funds from the IEFA for enforcement activities rather than adjudication services.", "Between 1993 and 2001, the INS continued to receive criticism for not meeting its service objectives, despite increases in funding from fees and appropriations. Many observers continued to assert that INS was using a portion of its immigration services collections to fund non-service activities such as border security and interior enforcement. This suspected interweaving of service and non-service funding prompted a push to separate the service and enforcement functions of the INS. In 1997, the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform recommended that the INS be dismantled and the adjudication and enforcement functions be divided up between the Department of State and the Department of Justice (DOJ), respectively. The Clinton and Bush Administrations, however, categorically rejected the proposed dismantling of INS and instead encouraged internal reforms.", "Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress decided to formally separate INS's enforcement and adjudication functions. With the passage of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (HSA), Congress dissolved the INS and established USCIS, a new immigration adjudication agency, within the newly formed Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The INS did attempt to increase its fees in FY2003 to cover anticipated additional costs related to security checks, but DOJ did not act upon the request due to the upcoming transition of immigration functions from DOJ to DHS. Since its creation, USCIS has been largely dependent upon fees to fund its services, with direct appropriations provided primarily for temporary projects.", "Appendix B.
