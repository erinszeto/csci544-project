The FDA uses a temporary restraining order (TRO) to respond to an emergency situation where immediate, temporary relief is needed, such as responding to the presence of a public health threat, which the FDA must immediately control. A TRO generally lasts for 10 days, with a possible additional 10-day extension before the FDA must seek additional enforcement action if necessary. A request for a TRO filed in court by the FDA may be subject to an ex parte hearing (where the defendant is not present). Upon gathering evidence in support of a TRO, the FDA should file the request for a TRO within 60 days. As a general rule of practice, a court considers evidence older than 60 days to be \"untimely\" and insufficient to support a TRO request.", "A preliminary injunction is a court order that temporarily requires the industry participant to stop the allegedly violative behavior prior to the final determination of the merits of a legal claim. A preliminary injunction filed by the FDA may be subject to a full hearing where the parties present evidence by affidavit or by the testimony of witnesses.", "A permanent injunction is a final order of the court requiring the industry participant to stop the violative behavior. A federal district court generally issues a permanent injunction following a hearing where the court found that the industry participant violated provisions of the FFDCA and there is a likelihood that the violations would continue without judicial intervention. Defendants in an injunction proceeding and the government may also agree to a \"Consent Decree of Permanent Injunction\" as the result of a negotiated settlement. Under the consent decree, the industry participant and the government agree to terms relating to the resolution of the past violative conduct by the industry participant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Process for Filing an Injunction", "paragraphs": ["The FDA, in partnership with the Department of Justice, first files a complaint for an injunction after the FDA has presented \"timely evidence\" of an FFDCA violation. Timely evidence includes the agency's identification of a health hazard or a gross consumer deception that requires immediate action to stop the violative practice. The agency may also seek an injunction if significant amounts of violative products owned by the same industry participant have entered interstate commerce or if an industry participant has refused a voluntary recall or has issued an inadequate recall. The agency may also choose to file for an injunction if a seizure is impractical or uneconomical. However, filing for an injunction does not preclude further enforcement action by the FDA such as a recall or criminal prosecution. ", "The FDA can strengthen its request for an injunction action in the complaint by demonstrating that the agency provided the defendants with adequate notice of the alleged violation(s) and an opportunity to correct the alleged violation(s). While prior notice is not legally required, such information can demonstrate the defendant's resistance to FFDCA compliance to a court, and thus support the agency's request for judicial involvement with an injunction. Types of notice may include letters, meetings, and telephone calls. Notice is adequate if it is given to individuals with authority to prevent or correct violations and includes sufficient information to show that the proper action to correct these violations has not yet been taken. ", "Courts have found that corporate officers as well as the corporate entity itself may be subject to FDA enforcement actions, including an injunction. The Supreme Court has stated that \"the public interest in the purity of its food is so great as to warrant the imposition of the highest standard of care on distributors.\" Because corporate agents and corporate entities both have the ability to inform themselves of the conditions of their facilities, the FDA has the authority to seek relief against executives as well as legal corporate entities. Thus, in order to successfully state a claim against individual defendants for the purposes of an injunction, the government must allege that the individuals had responsible relationships related to the furtherance of the transactions that ultimately violated the FFDCA. Pursuing enforcement action against an agent or corporation does not preclude additional enforcement action against the other. The court in U.S. v. Blue Ribbon Smoked Fish, Inc. found that the injunction against the corporate entity did not preclude an injunction against the agents of that entity due to the agents' supervisory and managerial roles over the food processing and the corresponding responsibility for the sanitation of the plant.

After the FDA and the DOJ have filed a complaint requesting an injunction, the court will determine whether the government's complaint meets the legal standard for an injunction. The standard for a statutory injunction initiated by the government, however, differs from the injunction standard for private litigants. A private litigant must establish that he or she is likely to succeed on the merits; that he or she is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; that the balance of equities weighs in favor of the party seeking the injunction; and that the injunction is in the public interest. The government, however, does not need to prove irreparable harm, as courts presume harm is present when a statutory violation has occurred. In order for the court to make such a presumption, the purpose of the statute at issue must focus on protecting public interest, such as food safety. The elevated standard of care that food processors must meet that is inherent in the FFDCA justifies this difference in legal standards. ", "In order for the court to issue an injunction, the government must show that the defendant has violated the FFDCA and \"some cognizable danger of recurrent violation\" of the statute is present. When evaluating the risk of recurrent violations, courts may infer a likelihood of future violations from past unlawful conduct. More specifically, courts may consider \"the bona fides of the expressed intent to comply, the effectiveness of the discontinuance and, in some cases, the character of past violations\" to determine whether the defendant would continue to violate the FFDCA. For example, the court in U.S. v. Chung's Products found a danger of recurrent violations when the defendant refused to provide information about the conditions and records of a facility, impeded entry of FDA investigators, and repeatedly failed to put in place the FFDCA required controls for C. botulinum. This record of noncompliance, according to the court, showed a \"cognizable danger of future violations necessitating a permanent injunction.\" ", "The scope of the injunction depends on the specific legal violations. A court may adjust the scope of the injunction depending on the likelihood that future violations may occur and whether the injunction can prevent these recurring violations. The court in U.S. v. N.Y. Fish, Inc. found multiple FFDCA violations by the defendants and the absence of any credible actions by the defendants to remedy even the most serious of the violations. While the court acknowledged that an injunction where the defendant has already taken remedial measures is overbroad and unnecessary, the court found that a broad injunction was appropriate in this case because of the inaction by the defendants and the likelihood that alleged violations would continue.", "Courts generally find the possibility that an injunction may put a party out of business as irrelevant with regards to determining the necessity and scope of an injunction. In U.S. v. Blue Ribbon Smoked Fish, the defendant-corporate agents opposed the substance of the government's proposed permanent injunction, arguing that the injunction would force the company out of business. The court, however, disagreed, stating that the injunction would not require the defendant company, Blue Ribbon, to stop processing food altogether, but to stop processing food \"that is or has become adulterated.\"", "After the court has issued the order for an injunction, the FDA monitors the injunction throughout the entire term of such injunction.

The complaint names the United States as the plaintiff and the goods as the defendant. The federal district court then issues a warrant for the arrest (seizure) of the article of food through in rem jurisdiction. Pursuant to the arrest warrant, a U.S. Marshal then seizes the violative goods and takes them into custody. The U.S. Marshall may physically remove the goods from the industry participant's warehouse or may sequester the goods from inventory in such a way to ensure that the goods subject to the seizure are separated from the rest of the inventory. Neither the industry participant nor the courts are involved in the seizure process until the FDA files a complaint for forfeiture.

If the court finds that the government has successfully met the legal standard, the court orders the condemnation of the food. If the court finds that the government has not met the legal standard, the court will release the goods from seizure. The government must prove by the preponderance of the evidence that the articles seized were food that travelled in interstate commerce and that this food was adulterated or misbranded when introduced into, while in, or while held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce. The government may use warning letters sent to the owner, expert testimony, and samples collected during inspections as evidence. If the owner chooses to argue against the seizure, the owner of the seized articles must show that the articles were improperly subject to seizure because the product is not adulterated or misbranded as defined by the FFDCA.

Constructive destruction involves using the article for another purpose, such as donating misbranded food to a charity. The U.S. Marshall may sell the goods, if legally permissible, to recover the costs of the seizure, or may convert the goods to another use, such as for animal food. The government may also destroy the article of food by burning, burial, or dumping, in accordance with other relevant laws, such as the National Environmental Policy Act. ", "If the owner filed a claim to the article of food, the owner may then agree to the entry of a Consent Decree, which would provide for the sale, destruction, or reconditioning of the article, as dictated by the court and agreed to by the federal government.

Under the decree, the owner who claims the goods is required to post a penal bond to the court at twice the retail value of the goods seized. The penal bond ensures that the owner complies with the conditions of the decree, as the owner must forfeit the penal bond if the terms and conditions of the decree are not kept. The owner must then destroy, recondition, or sell the article as dictated by the terms of the decree. Available methods of destruction include those followed by the U.S. Marshall as described in the previous paragraph. Reconditioning (such as through reprocessing or relabeling) must bring the article of food into compliance with FFDCA provisions, under FDA supervision. Courts generally defer to the FDA's discretion regarding the supervision of reconditioning plans. The owner bears the cost of bringing such article in compliance. When the court orders the sale of the goods, the owner must pay all money collected during a sale (less legal fees, costs, and charges) into the U.S. Treasury.", "If the article was imported into the United States, the owner may export the article in lieu of destruction.

The owner must also meet the export provisions of the FFDCA and show that the product is within the specifications of the foreign country purchaser and must label the shipping package of the goods \"FOR EXPORT ONLY.\" The owner cannot sell these products domestically.

Park, the Supreme Court found that a district court's jury instructions appropriately focused on the issue of the defendant's authority over the unsanitary conditions that led to the alleged violations. The defendant, Park, was the chief executive officer (CEO) of Acme Markets Inc. The government charged both the corporation and the defendant with violating the FFDCA. While the corporation pled guilty to the allegations of violating FFDCA's adulteration provisions, the defendant, Park, pleaded not guilty. The district court instructed the jury that in order to find the defendant guilty, he must have had \"a responsible relationship to the issue.\" The Court of Appeals reversed the district court's conviction, finding that the court's instructions may have left the jury with the erroneous impression that the defendant could be found guilty in the absence of \"wrongful action\" on his part. The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision, finding that the FFDCA imposes upon persons with supervisory authority the responsibility to seek out and remedy violations and to prevent such violations. According to the Court, the government does not need to show that the official had awareness of the criminal conduct due to the public safety context of the FFDCA. The Court justified this interpretation by emphasizing that the corporate official has the ability and opportunity to correct and prevent such violations while the public may not.", "Thus, under the Park doctrine, a responsible corporate official can be held liable for a first-time misdemeanor under the FFDCA without proof that the corporate official acted with intent or even negligence. Such corporate official does not need to have any actual knowledge of, or participation in, the specific offense to be held liable under this doctrine. The FDA claims that this doctrine has a strong deterrent effect for defendants and other regulated entities. When considering whether to pursue a Park doctrine prosecution against a corporate official, the FDA examines the individual's position in the company and his or her relationship to the violation. The FDA also considers whether the corporate official had the authority to prevent the violation. The Court in Park found that the failure to fulfill this duty imposed by the FFDCA and the position of authority provides a \"sufficient causal link\" for criminal prosecution and culpability.
