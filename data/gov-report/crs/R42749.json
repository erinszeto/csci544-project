Its purpose is to promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by persons with disabilities.", "Administration and Senate Actions", "Many U.S. policy makers, including President Obama and some Members of Congress, agree that existing U.S. laws and policies are compatible with CRPD. In fact, some CRPD provisions appear to be modeled after U.S. disability laws. The United States has historically recognized the rights of individuals with disabilities through various laws and policies, including the Americans with Disabilities Act.", "In July 2009, President Obama signed CRPD. The Administration transmitted it to the Senate for advice and consent to ratification in May 2012. Since then, Members of the Senate have taken several actions related to CRPD:", "The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations (SFRC) held a hearing on the Convention in July 2012 and later that month reported the treaty favorably to the full Senate by a vote of 13 in favor and 6 against, subject to certain conditions.

Critics of the Convention maintain that treaties are the \"supreme Law of the Land\" under the Constitution, and that U.S. ratification of CRPD could supersede federal, state, and local laws. Supporters assert that CRPD is a non-discrimination treaty that does not create new obligations. They contend that U.S. laws meet, and in some cases exceed, CRPD requirements. Debate may also center on the following issues:", "Role of the CPRD committee. Critics are concerned that recommendations of the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Convention's monitoring body, could deem U.S. laws to be in violation of CRPD and presume authority over the private lives of U.S. citizens. Supporters, including the Obama Administration, emphasize that committee decisions are non-binding under international and domestic law. Possible impact on U.S. citizens and businesses abroad. Some CRPD proponents contend that U.S. ratification may (1) improve the lives of U.S. citizens with disabilities living, working, or traveling abroad, and (2) \"level the playing field\" for U.S. companies that, unlike many of their foreign counterparts, already comply with higher disability standards. The extent to which U.S. ratification of CRPD may positively affect U.S. businesses or disabled U.S. citizens living or traveling abroad remains unclear. Role in U.S. foreign policy. Supporters contend that U.S. ratification may enhance U.S. credibility as it advocates the rights of persons with disabilities globally. Opponents argue that existing U.S. laws and policies are robust enough examples of U.S. commitment to the issue. Abortion. Some critics worry that the term \"sexual and reproductive health\" in CRPD could be a euphemism for abortion. Supporters note that the word \"abortion\" is never mentioned in the Convention and contend that no U.S laws related to abortion would be created as a result of U.S. ratification. Parental rights. Some are concerned that the U.S. ratification may give governments, and not U.S. parents, the right to make educational and treatment-related decisions for their disabled children. Others, including the Obama Administration, hold that existing federal, state, and local laws protect parental rights.", "Other issues that Senators may wish to consider include challenges to evaluating CRPD's effectiveness, obstacles to CRPD implementation, and the role and participation of civil society in CRPD mechanisms.", "For information on U.S. efforts to address the rights of persons with disabilities domestically, see CRS Report 98-921, The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA): Statutory Language and Recent Issues, by [author name scrubbed].

(The committee makes non-binding recommendations and has no authority over U.S. law.) Senators may also debate the potential benefits to U.S. ratification, such as the ability of the United States to advocate and share its experiences regarding the rights of disabled persons in global fora, and improved disability rights for U.S. citizens living and traveling abroad.

States Parties agree to \"undertake to ensure and promote the full realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all persons with disabilities without discrimination of any kind on the basis of disability.\"", "The Convention sets broad goals of autonomy, equality, acceptance, and accessibility for individuals with disabilities. It does not provide a definition of \"disability.\" It acknowledges that the term is an \"evolving concept\" that results from \"the interaction between persons with impairments and attitudinal and environmental barriers that hinders full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.\" (For example, a person in a wheelchair might fail to gain employment not because he or she uses a wheelchair, but because environmental barriers\u2014such as stairs, lack of ramps, or insufficient transportation\u2014impede access to the work place.)

The Convention's provisions can grouped into five general themes: ", "Equality and non-discrimination \u2014CRPD prohibits discrimination and requires States Parties to recognize that \"all persons are equal before and under the law and are entitled without any discrimination to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law.\" Accordingly, States Parties are required to take steps to ensure that reasonable accommodations are provided to persons with disabilities. Accessibility and personal mobility \u2014States Parties must take measures to ensure that persons with disabilities have equal access to the physical environment, to transportation, to information and communications, and to other facilities open or provided to the public. States Parties also must ensure \"liberty of movement\" and freedom of disabled persons to choose their nationality and residence on an equal basis with others. Education \u2014States Parties are required to \"ensure an inclusive education system at all levels.\" Persons with disabilities must be offered the same opportunities for free primary and secondary education as others in their communities, and their individual requirements must be reasonably accommodated. Within the general education system, persons with disabilities shall receive the support required \"to facilitate their effective education.\" Work and employment \u2014CRPD recognizes the right of disabled persons to work on an equal basis with others in an environment that is \"open, inclusive and accessible to persons with disabilities.\" Parties agree to prohibit employee discrimination against disabled persons and, if necessary, to adopt laws barring such discrimination in the employment process, including recruitment, hiring, retention, promotion, and termination. Health \u2014The Convention calls on States Parties to ensure that persons with disabilities have equal access to the same range, quality, and standard of free or affordable health care and programs as provided to other persons\u2014including in the areas of sexual and reproductive health. Under the Convention, health care professionals must provide equal care to persons with disabilities. ", "CRPD offers other broad legal protections, such as ensuring that persons with disabilities are not deprived of liberty, either unlawfully or arbitrarily. In addition, States Parties are required to take measures to protect disabled persons from exploitation and violence and abuse, as well as in emergency situations such as armed conflict, humanitarian crises, and natural disasters. States Parties must also take steps to ensure that persons with disabilities are able to attain and maintain maximum independence through comprehensive habilitation and rehabilitation services.

More broadly, supporters point out that many of CRPD's provisions call on States Parties to take \"all appropriate measures\" [emphasis added], thereby leaving it to governments to determine what actions are appropriate based on their domestic laws and policies. Supporters also emphasize that CRPD brings increased global attention to rights of disabled persons, and that ratification has led some countries to adopt laws and policies to improve disability rights. These and other selected issues are discussed in more detail in the following sections. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Role of the Disabilities Committee", "paragraphs": ["Opponents of CRPD ratification are concerned about the role of the Disabilities Committee in monitoring States Parties' compliance with CRPD. Specifically, critics are concerned that committee recommendations and decisions could supersede U.S. laws and presume authority affecting the lives, freedoms, and decisions of private citizens. Opponents highlight decisions made by other human rights treaty committees that in their view advocate abortion, undermine parental rights, or make recommendations that extend beyond the scope of the treaty. They worry that such decisions or recommendations could be used in U.S. courts to challenge existing laws and policies. ", "Proponents of the CRPD ratification, including the Obama Administration, emphasize that any decisions or recommendations made by the committee are \"advisory only\" and non-binding under international and domestic law. Supporters also note that there are no established rules in CRPD for enforcing the committee's decisions or addressing treaty non-compliance. Moreover, several human rights treaties ratified by the United States have monitoring committees similar to CRPD, and there appears to be no instance where a U.S. federal court or the executive branch has construed a committee's recommendations or decisions as having the force of law. ", "To address concerns related to the committee's role and authority, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC) adopted an understanding to accompany CRPD, which stated that the committee has no authority to compel action by States Parties, and that the United States does not consider conclusions, recommendations, or general comments issued by the committee as constituting customary international law or to be legally binding on the United States in any manner. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CRPD as an Instrument of U.S. Foreign Policy", "paragraphs": ["Supporters of CRPD contend that U.S. ratification would enhance the United States' credibility as it advocates the rights of persons with disabilities globally. For example, Obama Administration officials state that ratification will put the United States in the best possible position to influence the international community on disability rights, and that non-ratification would make it \"difficult\" to advance such interests. Supporters also emphasize that as a leader in disability rights, the United States could work within the framework of CRPD, such as in the Conference of States Parties, to provide expertise, guidance, and technical assistance to countries that seek to improve the well-being of disabled persons, particularly in the areas of education, employment, and accessibility. Moreover, many supporters suggest that, as a State Party, the United States could engage with the Disabilities Committee to nominate and vote for committee experts\u2014including, perhaps, a U.S. citizen\u2014to leverage U.S. expertise and influence the work of the committee. ", "On the other side, opponents argue that the United States does not need to ratify CRPD to demonstrate its credibility and leadership in disability rights. They suggest that U.S. laws and policies, such as the ADA, are robust examples of U.S. commitment to the issue. Critics also express concern regarding CRPD provisions that would obligate the United States to report to the treaty's monitoring body, the Disabilities Committee. Specifically, they worry that instead of providing a forum to share U.S. expertise or advocate disability rights, the committee might be used as a platform for political criticism of the United States, particularly by countries with lesser human rights standards. Opponents also emphasize that U.S. ratification itself may not enhance the rights of disabled persons in countries with poor human rights records. Any such improvements, they argue, can only be made by the governments of these countries. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Possible Impact on U.S. Citizens and Businesses Abroad", "paragraphs": ["When advocating for U.S. ratification of CRPD, many supporters highlight two key benefits for the United States. First, proponents contend that U.S. ratification, as well as the United States' overall support for the treaty, may improve the lives of U.S. citizens with disabilities living, working, or traveling abroad\u2014including students, retirees, veterans, and members of the U.S. Armed Forces. Currently, many developed countries do not have comparable disability services or infrastructure. This makes it difficult for U.S. citizens to be employed, move freely, and have the same rights and access to disability-related services in other countries as they would in the United States. Supporters suggest that as more countries ratify the Convention and implement its provisions, disability rights and services in other countries may improve. ", "Second, some CRPD supporters maintain that U.S. ratification would help U.S. companies that already comply with higher disability standards. Since the ADA was enacted in 1990, U.S. businesses have been required to make reasonable accommodations for their employees and customers, while businesses in countries with less stringent laws and policies have not been required to do so. Proponents suggest that CRPD ratification by the United States and other countries may lead foreign companies to institute such standards and thus help \"level the playing field\" for U.S. businesses. In addition, some maintain that increased global standards for and awareness of disabilities rights through CRPD ratification may provide new economic opportunities for U.S. companies. Supporters note that if international disabilities standards were to improve, new markets could emerge for U.S. companies that develop, manufacture, and sell disability-related products and technologies.", "The extent to which U.S. ratification of CRPD may positively affect U.S. businesses or disabled U.S. citizens living or traveling abroad is not entirely clear. States Parties to CRPD are responsible for implementing its provisions, and U.S. ratification of the treaty does not guarantee that all countries will fulfill their obligations under the Convention. Ultimately, CRPD's impact on disability rights and on the scope of the global market for disability-related services, expertise, and products will become more apparent as individual countries begin to implement the Convention's provisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Impact on Parental Authority", "paragraphs": ["Some opponents of CRPD contend that the treaty undermines the rights of parents of disabled children. Specifically, many take issue with Article 7(2), which states, \"In all actions concerning children with disabilities, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.\" Critics believe that this provision may give governments, and not U.S. parents, the right to make educational and treatment-related decisions for their disabled children. Additionally, opponents are concerned that the Disabilities Committee could have the authority to make decisions regarding the \"best interests\" of disabled children in the United States. For example, homeschooling advocates worry that the committee could declare homeschooling inconsistent with the best interest of the child, thereby undermining the right of parents to educate their children as they see fit. To address these concerns, in July 2014 the committee agreed to a homeschooling understanding, which states, \"Nothing in the Convention limits the rights of parents to homeschool their children.\"", "Supporters of the Convention, including the Obama Administration, maintain that CRPD would not undermine the rights of U.S. parents. They contend that existing federal, state, and local laws provide adequate protection for parents to do what they believe is in the best interests of their children. These protections, they emphasize, would be ensured through proposed reservations, understandings, and declarations (RUDs) to CRPD that include a non-self executing declaration and private conduct and federalism reservations. To further alleviate concerns about parental rights, SFRC adopted an understanding that states that the use of \"best interests of the child\" in Article 7(2) will be applied and interpreted as it is under U.S. law, and that nothing in Article 7 requires a change to existing U.S. law. More broadly, some supporters emphasize that concerns about CRPD's potential impact on parental rights should be viewed in the context of other provisions that appear to support the role of parents and families in the lives of disabled children."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Possible Impact on Abortion Laws and Policies", "paragraphs": ["The debate over U.S. ratification of CRPD reflects concern as to whether, and to what extent, the treaty might address abortion. In particular, some critics have raised questions about CRPD Article 25, which states that States Parties shall", "a) Provide persons with disabilities with the same range, quality and standard of free or affordable health care and programmes as provided to other persons, including in the area of sexual and reproductive health and population-based public health programmes; [and]", "b) Provide those health services needed by persons with disabilities specifically because of their disabilities, including early identification and intervention as appropriate, and services designed to minimize and prevent further disabilities, including among children and older persons\u2026.", "Many CRPD opponents maintain that abortion is an issue that should be handled at a state or local level, and not by an international body. They are concerned that the term \"sexual and reproductive health\" could be interpreted to be a euphemism for abortion. They also worry that U.S. ratification could obligate the United States to provide persons with disabilities access to free or affordable abortions or to overturn parental notification laws, thereby undermining current laws that ban federal funding for abortion. When advocating these views, critics note that after CRPD was adopted by the General Assembly, a Bush Administration official remarked that the United States understood that the phrase \"reproductive health\" in Article 25(a) did not include abortion. They further emphasize that Poland, Malta, and Monaco included reservations or declarations to CRPD that stated that nothing in Article 25 shall be interpreted to include abortion. Some opponents also suggest that the Disabilities Committee could interpret Article 25 to include abortion.", "CRPD advocates note that the word \"abortion\" is never mentioned in the treaty and contend that no U.S laws related to abortion would be created as a result of U.S. ratification. They maintain that references to sexual and reproductive health and health services are non-discrimination requirements that would not obligate the United States to modify its existing abortion laws or other health services. The Obama Administration emphasizes that Article 25, and the treaty as a whole, already complies with obligations under the ADA; specifically, any health care programs and benefits provided under domestic law, including those related to \"sexual and reproductive health,\" should also be provided to disabled persons. Supporters also point out that any recommendations made by the Disabilities Committee related to abortion are not legally binding. As discussed earlier, CRPD has no established mechanisms for treaty non-compliance; it relies primarily on States Parties to fulfill their treaty obligations. ", "To address ongoing concerns about CRPD's potential impact on existing abortion laws, SFRC approved an understanding stating that nothing in the Convention, including Article 25, addresses \"the provision of any particular health program or procedure.\" The understanding amended a previous proposal by Senator Marco Rubio that stated that Article 25(a) does not include abortion or create any abortion rights, nor could it be interpreted to constitute the support, endorsement, or promotion of abortion (including as a method of family planning). Although the amended measure was adopted by SFRC, several Senators have expressed dismay that the word \"abortion\" was not specifically mentioned in the understanding.

As a result, there is minimal evidence demonstrating its effectiveness or potential areas for improvement. Evaluating the country-specific or global impact of the treaty may be particularly difficult because there is a lack of consistent or comparable data on persons with disabilities worldwide and often within countries and regions. Challenges to implementation \u2014As States Parties take steps toward implementing the treaty's provisions, Senators may wish to monitor any challenges these countries face and how, if at all, CRPD mechanisms such as the Conference of States Parties or Disabilities Committee may assist with such issues. The United States may also consider ways that it can contribute to these bodies and share its expertise in disability rights as a CRPD observer. Role of civil society \u2014Civil society, including human rights and disability rights groups, play a particularly important role not only in raising awareness of disability issues, but also in holding governments accountable to their CRPD commitments. As such, the United States may wish to monitor and encourage the full participation of civil society in CRPD mechanisms, particularly the Disabilities Committee, which is charged with evaluating reports from States Parties\u2014some of which have weak disability rights standards.", "Appendix A.
