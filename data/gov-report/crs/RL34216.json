Proposals in the 110 th Congress to require brokers to report adjusted basis on publicly traded securities sold by individuals are examined in this report. Basis reporting can help clarify the actual amount of capital gains and thus the tax revenue from such gains may rise if capital gains have been under reported. Basis is \"the amount a taxpayer uses to determine the cost of acquiring an asset, which is used to determine the asset's capital gain or loss.\" The original cost may have to be altered in order to calculate the appropriate \"adjusted basis\" for tax calculations. For example, the original cost of a purchase of stock would be adjusted upwards to account for brokerage fees.", "The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) defines the tax gap \"as the aggregate amount of true tax liability imposed by law for a given tax year that is not paid voluntarily and timely.\" The IRS defines the true tax liability for any given taxpayer as \"the amount of tax that would be determined for the tax year in question if all relevant aspects of the tax law were correctly applied to all of the relevant facts of that taxpayer's situation.\" For the 2001 tax year, IRS estimated that the gross tax gap was approximately $345 billion. After enforcement efforts and late payments, this gross tax gap was reduced over several years by an estimated $55 billion to equal a net tax gap of $290 billion as reported in 2007.", "Current law requires brokers to report annually the name, address, and gross proceeds of each sale by a taxpayer to the IRS. Brokers are also required to report this information to each customer. The term broker includes \"a dealer, a barter exchange, and any other person who (for a consideration) regularly acts as a middleman with respect to property or services.\" An individual taxpayer's gain or loss is the difference between the amount realized on the sale of property and the adjusted basis. Because brokers are currently not required to report adjusted basis to the IRS, there is no third-party reporting of adjusted basis; consequently, the ability of the IRS to verify the amount of capital gains and losses reported by individuals is limited. Brokers would incur significant costs in reporting adjusted basis, but taxpayers would be relieved of the often substantial costs of calculating adjusted basis to determine capital gains and losses from the sale of securities. According to the IRS, third-party reporting increases voluntary tax compliance.", "For tax year 2001, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that an estimated 8.4 million out of an estimated 21.9 million taxpayers (or 38%) with securities transactions misreported their securities gains and losses. GAO calculated that the most frequent reason for this misreporting of securities gains and losses was the inaccurate reporting of basis of securities sold.", "The issue of reporting basis is complicated by the following current computation rules:", "If a taxpayer has acquired stock in a corporation on different dates or at different prices and sells or transfers some of the shares of that stock, and the lot from which the stock is sold or transferred is not adequately identified, the shares deemed sold are the earliest acquired shares (the \"first-in-first-out rule\"). If a taxpayer makes an adequate identification of shares of stock that it sells, the shares of stock treated as sold are the shares that have been identified. A taxpayer who owns shares in a regulated investment company (\"RIC\") generally is permitted to elect, in lieu of the specific identification or first-in-first-out methods, to determine the basis of RIC shares sold under one of two average-cost-basis methods described in Treasury regulations.", "A proposal to report basis was included in the President's FY2008 Budget and is discussed in this report.

This time period may be approximately two years after Treasury regulations have been written. Witnesses emphasized that some financial intermediaries would have to develop new systems to report basis and other intermediaries would have to reprogram existing systems. From Treasury's perspective, additional time to implement the reporting of basis would result in lost tax revenue.", "Second, two witnesses maintained that the flexibility in the methods of reporting basis should be maintained. Currently, a taxpayer may use the \"first-in-first-out rule\" or the specific identification rule. A taxpayer who owns shares in a mutual fund may use either of these rules or one of two average-cost-basis methods. Many mutual funds report basis to their customers using an average cost method. From the IRS perspective, requiring the use of one standard rule such as \"first-in-first-out\" would expedite the use of cost basis data for IRS matching purposes.", "Third, two witnesses believed that filing requirements should be prospective, based on the date of purchase, or brokers should not be held accountable for errors in data on current and prior reports of adjusted basis. Many brokers do not have records concerning basis and must rely on customers or third parties for information.", "Fourth, two witnesses expressed opposition to extending gross proceeds reporting (and thus adjusted basis reporting) to corporate customers because the Secretary of the Treasury already has the authority to extend gross proceeds reporting to corporations, without legislative action if corporations are a significant source of noncompliance.", "Fifth, one witness stated that the volume of transfers of securities would preclude a paper transfer system providing brokers with data to calculate adjusted basis; hence, an electronic system would be necessary.

These witnesses maintained that the legislative language in the Senate Finance Committee's draft proposal did not address many issues such as the reporting of gifted and inherited securities and the reporting of options transactions. Congress could specify many of these issues in legislative language, which would result in congressional preference being implemented and a reduced need for Treasury discretion in writing rules.", "Seventh, two witnesses maintained that the deadline for filing 1099 statements should be delayed by two weeks, which is addressed by S. 636 , the Reduce Wasteful Tax Forms Act of 2007.

Numerous implications for drafting legislation to report basis may be derived from their testimony.", "Investment Company Institute", "The Investment Company Institute (ICI) emphasized three points concerning reporting of basis:", "First, a mandatory basis-reporting regime will be costly, and the cost ultimately will be borne by fund investors. Second, sufficient time must be provided to ensure that necessary programming and systems challenges are addressed effectively. Finally, the flexibility the current law provides to mutual funds and their shareholders to compute cost basis under any available method (first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\"), specific identification, and average cost, in the case of fund shareholders) must be maintained. We recognize that allowing this flexibility will limit the use of cost basis information for Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") matching purposes.", "The ICI indicated that many mutual funds currently provide average cost basis information to a substantial portion of their shareholders, but some funds (particularly smaller funds) do not provide any cost basis information. No mutual fund provides cost basis information to all of its shareholders because the fund managers do not have or cannot have access to the necessary information or are not confident that the information is accurate. The ICI maintains that mutual funds would \"need sufficient lead time to program their systems to provide cost basis information to all of their shareholders in all circumstances.\" The date applicable to basis reporting should be the later of \"December 31 of the calendar year that ends more than 18 months after the date of enactment or December 31 of the first calendar year that ends at least twelve months after the issuance of final regulations by the Secretary.\" The ICI maintained that filing requirements should be prospective based on the date of purchase if the fund has not reported cost basis data. If a fund wishes to try and reconstruct basis using \"good faith efforts\" then the mutual fund would have reasonable cause for any errors. The internal transfer of shares in mutual funds results in complex recording issues. The ICI recommends that the written statement requirement for data on the transfer of stock may also be met using electronic transmittal.", "Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association", "The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) represents the interests of more than 650 securities firms, banks, and asset managers. SIFMA made five major recommendations.", "(1) SIFMA strongly opposes the proposal to extend gross proceeds reporting (and thus adjusted basis reporting) to corporate customers and recommends this proposal be dropped. The Secretary of the Treasury already has the authority to extend gross proceeds reporting to corporations and can exercise this authority without legislative action if corporations are a significant source of noncompliance.", "(2) The Secretary of the Treasury should be granted broad regulatory authority to implement the new reporting requirements and to provide safe harbors, uniform adjusted basis calculation rules, simplifying assumptions, and limited exceptions if justified.", "(3) The new reporting regulations should be effective for securities acquired 18 months after Treasury regulations are finalized (rather than 18 months after date of enactment). Brokers cannot develop or modify their basis reporting systems if they do not know the rules they must follow.", "(4) The definition of \"applicable security\" should be clarified.", "(5) S. 636 , the Reduce Wasteful Tax Forms Act of 2007 ... should be incorporated into the proposal. The new reporting requirements will greatly increase year-end processing for brokers and custodians, thus increasing the number of corrected 1099 and cost basis statements that will have to be issued to taxpayers and the IRS.

The reason is that timing and accounting differences would result in mismatches in gross figures being reported to corporate customers and the IRS. Hence, the Clearing House states that \"the cost to implement gross proceeds and basis reporting on payments to corporations will ... be prohibitive with no foreseeable benefit to the Internal Revenue Service or the corporate customers.\" The Clearing House maintains that financial institutions and brokers would be unable to report adjusted basis and holding period information for certain securities such as foreign securities and securities purchased as part of a dividend reinvestment program. The Clearing House argues that the proposal's requirement that persons transferring securities to a broker provide that broker with a written statement which includes data to calculate adjusted basis \"is inefficient, burdensome, unmanageable and susceptible to error.\" The Clearing House believes that the volume of transfers of securities would preclude a paper transfer system and necessitate an electronic system.", "The Clearing House represents large banks that do not collect and send basis or holding period data to their customers; hence, these large banks would have to develop necessary information systems, which would be time consuming. In addition, large banks are currently integrating multiple information reporting systems. Consequently, the Clearing House advocates an effective date for compliance with the proposal of either three years after the date of the passage of the law or two years after the finalization of relevant Treasury regulations.", "American Bankers Association", "A representative of the American Bankers Association (ABA) provided written comments that stated that the Finance Committee's proposal raised significant issues among its members. The ABA indicated that while banks serving in fiduciary and related capacities were required to meet Section 6045 filing requirements, they may not be directly involved in either the purchase or sale of securities; hence, they do not have direct access to the necessary information concerning basis or have access only through third-party reporting. The ABA maintains that the proposal should require that banks receive information from the party that files Form 1099-B, and banks should be able to rely on the accuracy of information from third parties, particularly clients, without penalty. The ABA argues that the proposal should be effective prospectively and allow sufficient time to implement after regulations have been established. The ABA maintains that taxpayers should be allowed to continue to select the method of accounting for gains and losses on securities sold. Finally, the ABA states that the IRS should be provided with broad authority to provide exceptions or safe harbors where determining adjusted basis is difficult or impossible.", "National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts", "The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) represents U.S. real estate investment trusts (REITs) and publicly traded real estate companies worldwide.
