(1) During the 1980s, the United States along with othercountries had funded, through Pakistan, the mujahedin forces fighting against the Soviet Union, aswell as providing humanitarian aid to the large refugee camps in Pakistan. After the Soviet Unionleft Afghanistan and dissolved, the United States sharply reduced its programs. From FY1994, theUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID) did not have a mission inAfghanistan, but continued to provide aid mainly through U.N. agencies and non-governmentalorganizations (NGOs). During the violent civil war that lasted throughout the 1990s, the UnitedNations continued to seek a peace agreement, which would allow for sustained reconstruction. However, with the failure of several peace agreements, the international donor community focusedprimarily on humanitarian aid because the conditions were not stable for long-term development anddonors did not want to provide assistance to the Taliban, which came to power in 1996. Between1996 and 2001, the United States alone provided half a billion dollars in emergency aid toAfghanistan. (2)", "The assistance situation changed dramatically once the Taliban was removed from power, allowing for the implementation of humanitarian assistance and the development of reconstructionplans. These plans quickly took shape with the Bonn Accord on December 5, 2001, which led to theformation on December 22, 2001 of an interim government led by Hamid Karzai. The centralgovernment was further strengthened in June 2002 through the loya jirga , which was attended by1,550 delegates. It chose a new government to run Afghanistan for the next two years during whichtime a new constitution is to be drafted and elections are to be held. At the loya jirga , Karzai waschosen to lead the new government named the Islamic Transitional Government of Afghanistan(ITGA). The Afghan government has been working with the international donor community onreconstruction programs and plans, since a major donor conference in January 2002 in Tokyo andsubsequent ongoing meetings with international donors. ", "As a result of decades of violent conflict, Afghanistan is in great need of substantial reconstruction, from roads and schools to a broad range of development projects encompassing thewhole country. According to USAID, the decades of civil war and proxy regional war have createdfour intertwining and competing economies in Afghanistan. (3) These economies create conflictingincentives for Afghans and their neighbors and have a determining influence on the future ofAfghanistan. ", "There is the war economy, an economy of arms trafficking, looting, kidnaping, black market activity, and the brokering of violence. Different factions, funded by neighboringcountries, control border crossings, generate revenue from trade and illicit smuggling, supportmilitias through arms purchases, and thus fuel violence. Some contend that this economy createsincentives for the continuation of conflict;", "Connected with the first is the drug economy. (4) Poppy trade provides substantialincome for some Afghans, but also has led to skyrocketing addiction rates in the region and createdincentives leading away from other forms of agriculture critical to the sustained livelihood of thecountry; ", "As a result of decades of conflict, deep poverty, and on-going drought, manyAfghans rely on the benevolence of the international community, which has created a humanitarianaid economy. While humanitarian aid is essential in the short-term, the influx of money and peoplecan create distortions in local markets and provide few incentives for local production. As a result,development aid agencies will be critical to assisting Afghans with local production;", "Agriculture has always been a mainstay of the Afghan economy, and, before the civil war, Afghanistan had been self-sustaining in agricultural production. In addition,Afghanistan also has other economic sectors, though much weakened by war. The most vibrantsector is transportation, which has long traversed Afghanistan and connected Central Asia with theMiddle East and South Asia, but Afghanistan also has coal mines, oil and natural gas reserves, anda carpet weaving industry.

During the height of theanti-Taliban war and with the preparations for both winters (2002 and 2003), the focus of assistancewas on the continuation of the war and on humanitarian aid and quick-impact projects. Humanitarian, military, and security assistance continue.", "Humanitarian Assistance. The United Nations and other organizations have provided Afghans humanitarian assistance since at least 1979, whenthe Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. (5) As a resultof this long-term involvement, the UnitedNations and other organizations had a basic institutional network in the region to provide and expandhumanitarian assistance. ", "Since the fall of the Taliban regime and the establishment of a new government, this institutional network has been utilized. The Afghan government and the international donorcommunity have sought to focus on reconstruction, but humanitarian relief assistance continues tobe greatly needed. The overwhelming majority of assistance (outside of military aid) to date hasbeen spent on humanitarian needs. The United States has been the largest contributor ofhumanitarian assistance to Afghans. (6)", "Refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) have been the focus of much humanitarian assistance. These groups have been returning to their homes in unexpectedly high numbers. The U.N.High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reports that since March 1, 2002, more than two millionAfghan refugees have repatriated mainly from Pakistan but also from other neighboring countries. This is more than double the number expected by UNHCR. As of August 2002, another 230,000IDPs returned to their homes with the assistance of the International Organization for Migration(IOM). (7) Returnees require continuing humanitarianaid, but they also need transitional assistancefor resettlement, such as housing supplies, seeds and agricultural resources, jobs, and other services.With the return rate higher than expected, UNHCR and other aid agencies remain very concernedthat they cannot provide returnees with the same level of resources as previously and that returneesare also returning to a lack of adequate resources. ", "At the same time, there are many other refugees and IDPs who have still not returned to their homes and require humanitarian assistance. The difficulties of winter are affecting large proportionsof the Afghan population, not only returning refugees and IDPs. In response, aid agencies haveprepositioned food, clothing, and other items, particularly in areas typically isolated during thewinter. Furthermore, the region has been affected by a severe drought since 1999. While some areashave improved, the drought continues, which means that some areas cannot return to previous levelsof agricultural production and continue also to rely on humanitarian assistance. ", "Military Assistance. The international military involvement in Afghanistan, Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), began on October 7, 2001.Twenty-seven nations have deployed more than 14,000 troops in support of OEF. (8) Of these twentyseven, 14 NATO members, NATO Partners, and other countries have been involved through specialoperations forces, the provision of planes and ships, and operations involving surveillance andinterception. OEF continues with 9,000 U.S. troops and about 2,500 non-Afghan, non-Americantroops. These troops in Afghanistan continue to search for Taliban and al Qaeda fighters andweapons caches in southern and eastern Afghanistan. (9) According to the Department of Defense(DOD), the cost of the war in Afghanistan has been $12.595 billion for the United States inFY2002. (10)", "According to the Afghan government, the United Nations, and international NGOs, the lack of security remains the most serious challenge. (11) Former commanders maintain control over their ownareas and continue fighting with their rivals, which further makes difficult the extension of thenational government, the provision of humanitarian assistance, and the initiation and implementationof reconstruction. With the continued fighting and insecurity, the process of demobilization andintegration of combatants has been slow, but on January 10, 2003, the United Nations and theAfghan government announced a plan for 250,000 militiamen to hand over their weapons inexchange for cash, vocational training, and employment assistance. (12)", "The main programs to improve the security situation have been the insertion of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and the creation of an Afghan National Army (ANA) and policeforce. (13) ISAF is a U.N.-mandated, multinationalforce deployed in and around Kabul as apeacekeeping force since December 20, 2001. Twenty-three countries, mostly NATO allies, havecontributed troops or personnel to the 4,500-strong force. The mission of the ISAF is to (1) assistthe interim Afghan government in building a national security infrastructure, (2) assist in thecountry's reconstruction, and (3) assist Afghanistan in training its future security forces. At the endof June 2002, the United Kingdom handed over to Turkey the command of ISAF. Germany and theNetherlands took over command of ISAF on February 10, 2003. U.S. troops provide some assistanceto the ISAF (i.e., logistical, intelligence, and quick reaction force support), but they do not engagein peacekeeping. ", "President Karzai, U.N. officials, and others have asked that ISAF be expanded, so that peacekeeping could take place outside of Kabul, but there has been a lack of international consensuson this issue. (14) In response to security concerns,the Pentagon has initiated a shift from an emphasison military action to one on reconstruction and security. While U.S. military action continues underOEF, by February 2003 the U.S. military planned to put 75% of its effort towards reconstructingsecurity services and supporting civil reconstruction through \"provincial reconstruction teams,\"which would join civilian and military efforts in regional areas outside Kabul. (15) The United Stateswill also be centrally involved in the training of the ANA. According to government officials, theUnited States will keep some troops in Afghanistan for several years.

The internationalcommunity and the Afghan government have sought to establish a common set of goals in order toutilize donor funds most effectively. In agreement with many in the international donor communityduring its six-month tenure, the first transitional government identified intended outcomes of thereconstruction process: political stability and security, access to basic services, an adequate standardof living for its people, economic growth, and, in the long term, independence from foreign aid. (17)", "However, these goals are broad and abstract because Afghanistan not only experienced 23 years of war but also was one of the less developed countries even before the war. Particularly in the caseof Afghanistan, humanitarian assistance, reconstruction, and development are not easily separable. Humanitarian assistance can overlap with the goals of reconstruction, such as by repairing watersystems to provide clean water or by providing basic building materials to repair housing. Reconstruction and development further blend in the case of Afghanistan. These efforts run onparallel and sometimes overlapping tracks.

Building on these initiatives, the international community seesAfghanistan as a test case for new forms of donor coordination.

(18) U.S.government funding has come from three main agencies - USAID, the State Department, andDepartment of Defense (DOD) - and follows several routes to Afghanistan. First, the United Statesprovides bilateral aid to Afghanistan. These bilateral funds are either distributed to NGOs, whichprovide services in Afghanistan, or directly to the Afghan government. At USAID, funds aredistributed through the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), the Office of TransitionInitiatives (OTI), the Office of Food for Peace (FFP), Economic Growth Agriculture and Trade(EGAT) Bureau, and the Asia Near East (ANE) Bureau. (19) At the State Department, funds aredistributed through the Bureau for Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM), Bureau forInternational Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), and Humanitarian Demining Programs(HDP). DOD provides funding through its Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster and Civic Aid(OHDACA) program, which includes three segments: the Humanitarian Mine Action Program, theHumanitarian Assistance Program, and Foreign Disaster Relief Assistance. (20) Military and securityassistance are also provided through the DOD. Other funds are distributed through U.S. Departmentof Agriculture (USDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).", "Second, Afghanistan also receives U.S. aid through multilateral institutions. The most important avenue is through the United Nations and its affiliated agencies, such as U.N. HighCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), U.N. Development Program (UNDP), the World FoodProgram (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO), and through international financialinstitutions, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Some U.S. fundingfor Afghanistan comes from U.S. dues and additional voluntary donations to the United Nationsthrough the State Department's International Organizations account or, in the case of UNHCR,through the State Department's Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) account and EmergencyRefugee and Migration Assistance (ERMA) Fund. Funds for the World Bank and other internationalfinancial institutions are allocated through the Treasury Department within the foreign operationsappropriation bill. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "International Institutions", "paragraphs": ["For countries emerging from conflict, the international donor community has established a series of institutional mechanisms for developing and coordinating reconstruction. Though adaptedto specific situations, these institutional mechanisms are generally the same. In general, theinternational donor community is considered to be made up of international organizations and donorcountries. This section provides an overview of the institutional map of the international donorcommunity working with Afghanistan. ", "Pre-existing Institutions. Many institutions were in place before September 11, 2001. The United Nations and the World Bank demonstrate thelargest institutional presence in conflict and post-conflict areas, though many NGOs and otherinternational actors have long played an essential assistance role in Afghanistan. In Afghanistan in1988, the Geneva Peace Accords were signed, which led to the Soviet withdrawal. With the peaceaccord in place, the United Nations established an active presence in Afghanistan. The UnitedNations commonly maintains separate offices for (1) political and peace processes (Pillar I) and (2)humanitarian and reconstruction operations (Pillar II). Since 1988 in Afghanistan, these offices hadreceived a series of different names, but most recently the Pillar I office was run by the UnitedNations Special Mission to Afghanistan (UNSMA) and the Pillar II office was run by the UnitedNations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA). ", "With each attempt at a sustainable peace, the United Nations sought to implement reconstruction. As the U.N.'s development agency, UNDP in 1993 conducted a major study for theimmediate rehabilitation and long-term reconstruction of Afghanistan in response to peace accordsin that year. As a result, UNDP and others had systematically examined the humanitarian andreconstruction needs of a post-war Afghanistan, but the peace process did not hold and fightingbegan again. ", "In 1997, there was hope again for a peace accord. (21) In Afghanistan, UNDP developed itsStrategic Framework, a new coordinating structure aimed to bring coherence to multilateral, bilateral,and non-government efforts. The UNDP planned to reorient international development accordingto this new structure, and thus Afghanistan played an important role in these new ideas andprograms. As part of this framework, the United Nations organized the International Forum onAssistance to Afghanistan in Turkmenistan, which led to the Afghanistan Support Group (ASG).Made up of the 15 largest donor countries and the EU, ASG met (until recently) twice per year andfocused on coordination of humanitarian relief efforts. (22) Since September 11, 2001, this formalcoordinating structure for humanitarian and reconstruction efforts has been utilized. ", "The World Bank has also had a continuing role. For countries in conflict, the World Bank generally puts them in \"Watching Brief\" status, during which the World Bank monitors the country'seconomy and provides analytical support to international relief agencies at work within its borders,thus supporting preparation efforts for reconstruction. In 1997, Afghanistan entered Watching Briefstatus, which, beyond monitoring, also provided funds for training of Afghan women'snon-governmental organizations based in Pakistan and for training of Afghan teachers in refugeecamps also in Pakistan. ", "New Coordinating Institutions. In November 2001, with the possibility of the fall of the Taliban and a potential opening for sustainablereconstruction work, the international donor community quickly began new initiatives. The donorcountries formed the Steering Group for Assistance in the Reconstruction of Afghanistan inWashington, DC, chaired by the European Union, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. TheSteering Group began an assessment of Afghanistan's needs. To coordinate donor activities on amore operational level, the Steering Group in January 2002 formed the Implementation Group,which met quarterly in 2002 in Kabul, providing further support to the Afghan government. ", "The World Bank with other multilateral organizations organized several conferences where Afghans, NGOs, and donors discussed reconstruction. The World Bank also prepared a TransitionalSupport Strategy (TSS) that outlines a range of tasks, while the UNDP organized an ImmediateTransitional Assistance Program (ITAP). The ITAP sets out immediate tasks and quick-impactprograms. In March 2002, the United Nations formed United Nations Assistance Mission inAfghanistan (UNAMA) bringing together the political (Pillar I) and humanitarian/reconstruction(Pillar II) efforts. Lakhdar Brahimi, Special Representative for the Secretary-General to Afghanistan,organized the Bonn Accord signed on December 5, 2001 and now directs UNAMA. (23)", "Currently, the international donor community has put great emphasis on \"ownership\" - meaning leadership and control - of reconstruction efforts by the country itself. The Afghan government hastaken on an increasingly central role in reconstruction planning and the management of aid funds. In February 2002, the Afghan government established the Afghan Assistance Coordination Authority(AACA) that interacts with donor coordination groups to regulate aid traffic and seeks to ensure thatthe aid provided supports some government programs and is not fragmented or subject to donorcompetition. AACA monitors aid flows through a database - funded and provided by UNDP - thattracks donors, their pledges, and programs. (24) Thedatabase is considered to be about 70% accurate.The Afghan government has also developed its own priorities in its National DevelopmentFramework (NDF), which is going through further revision to become the National DevelopmentBudget (NDB) by March 2003. ", "Consultative Groups are institutional mechanisms associated with the World Bank that provide more control to countries receiving assistance than the \"Watching Brief\" status because countryrepresentatives are members of consultative groups. On December 18, 2002, the ASG dissolveditself and turned over its responsibilities to the new Consultative Group based in Kabul and led byAfghan finance minister, Ashraf Ghani. (25) ThisConsultative Group will differ from the usual modelin that consultative Groups primarily focus on economic development, but the Afghan group willalso maintain an emphasis on humanitarian needs because of continuing serious humanitarianconcerns. (26)", "Donor Conference and Trust Funds. In addition to providing their own assistance to Afghanistan, international organizations and internationalfinancial institutions have administered donor conferences, trust funds, and humanitarian andreconstruction programs. With the Bonn accord and interim government in place, the UNDPorganized a donor conference, in which the interim government presented its reconstruction plansand country representatives and international NGOs made pledges in order to show internationalsupport for those plans. These pledges represent amounts that countries were willing to earmark forAfghanistan. At the first major donor conference, which took place in January 21-22, 2002 in Tokyo,the ITAP was presented and funds pledged. Sixty-one countries and twenty-one internationalorganizations pledged $1.8 billion for 2002. The U.S. government alone pledged $297 million, justunder 25% of total pledges. The cumulative total was $4.5 billion, with some states making pledgesover multiple years and commitments of different time frames. The next major donor conferenceis scheduled for March 2003, during which the Afghan government will present its NationalDevelopment Budget (NDB) and donors direct their pledges toward specific priorities in the NDB. (27)", "The international community has placed great emphasis on paying the Afghan government's current expenditures, most importantly the salaries of government employees, in order to build upgovernment capacity and sustain momentum. Towards this end, several trust funds have beenestablished. Trust funds allow for rapid distribution of monies because they remove theadministrative requirements of multiple funds. Donor countries decide to contribute to these trustfunds and urge others to make contributions. UNDP created the Afghan Interim Authority Fund(AIAF) for donor contributions to the first six months of governmental operations and other relatedactivities, mobilizing $65.8 million for immediate operating costs. AIAF paid the salaries of over100,000 civil servants in the first two months of the government, repairs of ministry and statebuildings, the operation of the Emergency Loya Jirga Commission, the provision of basic equipmentand vehicles for ministries, and the preparation work of experts for the establishment of a CivilService Commission. (28)", "On July 22, 2002, the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) succeeded the AIAF. ARTF provides funds for the government's budget, investment activities and programs includingquick-impact recovery projects, funding to support the participation of Afghan experts residingabroad, and training programs for Afghans. Contributions from donors to date have totaled some $95million, and over $200 million more is expected. (29) In addition, the Law and Order Trust Fund forAfghanistan (LOTFA) is beginning to cover the basic needs of the police in the Kabul region. UNDPmanages this fund in cooperation with the Afghan government and the UNAMA. Activities to becovered through LOTFA include the rehabilitation of police facilities, payment of salaries, trainingand capacity-building, and procurement of non-lethal equipment. The idea is that sufficientresources will be provided to this fund to allow funding activities to be expanded to other provincessoon. (30)", "Coordination Challenges. From decades of experience in Afghanistan, the international community has developed coordinating mechanisms andinstitutions, which have helped to move the reconstruction process forward. Coordination is animportant goal and, as has been demonstrated in previous conflicts, coordinated activities generallylead to fewer unintended consequences, quicker learning processes, and more effective results. (31) Theinstitutional networks have altered over time with UNAMA taking on the main coordinating role inMarch 2002. ", "Some observers argue that the Afghan government, international organizations, NGOs, donor countries, and others are following their own priorities and programs, and are not coordinatedenough. (32) Some have suggested that completecoordination may be both unnecessary and ineffective,especially when different organizations do not share common goals or strategies. (33) For example, theUnited Nations, the United States, and others have supported regime change in Afghanistan, whichhas led to a specific strategy to bolster the regime change with reconstruction. For those inAfghanistan and the region who do not support this goal of regime change or for those who havebeen marginalized by regime change (such as former supporters of the Taliban regime), supposedlyneutral, non-partisan humanitarian assistance could appear partisan. Coordination is a complicatedmatter, but some would argue that there should be coordination only among like-mindedorganizations, such as among humanitarian groups, separate from the coordination of politicalgroups, and separate from the coordination of military oriented groups. (34)"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Funding", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "International and U.S. Funding Levels", "paragraphs": ["Areas of concern include whether the funding levels to Afghanistan are adequate and whether funding is being used for reconstruction. The Afghan government's donor assistance database,which keeps track of aid flows, provides a picture of international funding levels. (For a list of thefunds committed and disbursed by country, see the appendix of this report.) It should be recognizedthat these numbers are self-reported by countries, may include double counting (such as countrypledges that flow through U.N. organizations), and may cover non-monetary items (such as food aidor donation of used goods). In addition, some new projects have not yet been included, such as aroad project proposed by Iran. ", "Donor countries have committed $1.7 billion and, from that, disbursed $1.5 billion. The top donor countries (in descending order by funds committed) are as follows: the United States,European Commission, Japan, Germany, United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, the Netherlands, Italy,France, and China. (35)", "Pledge Fulfillment Problems. With donor countries committing $1.7 billion and disbursing $1.5 billion, the numbers approach the $1.8 billionpledged at the donor conference in Tokyo in January 2002. Throughout the year, however, theAfghan government expressed disappointment and even exasperation for delays in the delivery offunds that slowed reconstruction and, therefore, undermined popular support of the government.According to the Afghan government, as of October 11, 2002, about 67% of the pledges had beendisbursed. (36) Some of these delays could beexplained by the donor countries' need to obtainCongressional or Parliamentary support and appropriations for funds, which takes time. Yet, effortshave been needed to make certain countries deliver their pledges. In addition, some countries havechanged their pledges. For example, for the Kabul-Kandahar-Herat road project, Saudi Arabia haschanged its $50 million pledge to a $30 million low-interest loan. (37) In response to Afghangovernment requests, the U.S. Defense Department and State Department have assigned seniorofficials to raise money from other countries for reconstruction, particularly for the training,equipping, and housing of the Afghan national army. Two of these senior officials went to thePersian Gulf to fund-raise and obtained several new pledges. (38)", "Questions about Funding Levels. Despite the seemingly large pledges, many observers have argued that even the pledged amounts are notadequate. According to the preliminary needs assessment presented in January 2002 by the UNDP,the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Afghanistan would need $15 billion overthe next 10 years. (39) U.S. Secretary of State ColinPowell stated that Afghanistan would need $8billion over the next five years. (40) The Afghangovernment, however, seeks much more money andresources for reconstruction, arguing that 23 years of war necessitates increased funds. The Afghangovernment seeks $22 billion over the next decade and $45 billion over twenty years. (41) Donorcountries at the Tokyo conference pledged around $4.5 billion, about one third of theUNDP-WB-ADB $15 billion estimate, though the $1.8 billion pledge for the first year met theestimated levels. The U.N. Secretary-General has criticized these pledging levels: \"the [Afghan]Government, regrettably, remains very much under-resourced. The total needs of a countryrecovering from over two decades of conflict, destruction and drought outstrip even the $1.8 billiongenerously pledged at the donor conference held in Tokyo on 21 and 22 January 2002.\" (42) In sum,the long-term funds pledged have not reached the amount deemed necessary by the UNDP, WorldBank, and ADB.", "Observers also have found that, in comparison with other countries, Afghanistan has received smaller pledges and less funding. The pledges calculated as per capita annual allocations are farsmaller in Afghanistan than in many other post-conflict situations - $42 for Afghanistan, versus$195 for East Timor, $288 for Kosovo and $326 for Bosnia. (43) As part of this funding, the numbersof peacekeepers have also been comparatively low. The number of people per peacekeeper has beenin Kosovo 48 people, in Bosnia 58 people, in Sierra Leone 304 people, and in Afghanistan 5,380people. (44)", "Making Reconstruction a Funding Priority. The Afghan government has particularly complained that donors have not provided adequate funding forreconstruction. The overwhelming majority of U.S. funding dedicated to Afghanistan has gone toDOD's spending for the war against the Taliban and al Qaeda and DOD's continued activities. ForFY2002, the amount is $12.595 billion. (45) Thattotal is about 24 times greater than the $531 millionthat the U.S. government spent in FY2002 on humanitarian and reconstruction assistance. (46)", "The Pentagon has indicated that some troops are now aiding in road construction and other reconstruction projects as well as performing their normal duties. The $6.1 billion that DODreceived for Afghanistan and the global war on terrorism in H.J. Res 2, P.L. 108-7 , the FY2003Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, covers DOD's continuing costs of deploying forces inAfghanistan and heightening security in the United States in the first quarter of FY2003. ", "In non-military assistance, most funding - some say 70% of FY2002 funds - went towards humanitarian aid-usually considered urgent food, shelter, and medical care. (47) The majority of thisassistance was food aid, which is essential for humanitarian crises but, according to experts, isproblematic in the longer term for reconstruction. According to this view, food aid in anon-emergency situation undercuts market prices for food and decreases the incentive for agriculturalproduction. (48)", "In addition, the Afghan government argues for a different process of funding. Since humanitarian aid generally moves through the United Nations and non-governmental organizations,the Afghan government does not have access to these funds or control over how they are distributed. Moreover, it cannot use these funds to increase capacity building in the government and thereforecannot demonstrate government effectiveness to the Afghan population.

Road and bridge construction, as well road clearing, particularly during the winter snows, have been another majoremployment area for Afghans. Such infrastructural work is also important for the Afghan economyand the extension of the Afghan government across the nation.

(73) Other road construction, aswell as bridge construction, is taking part in different areas of the country. ", "Agricultural Rehabilitation. Rehabilitation of theagricultural sector is one key element in the reorientation of the Afghan economy away from the warand drug economies. In the past, Afghanistan has demonstrated the ability to be not onlyagriculturally self-sufficient, but also an agricultural exporter. As of 1978, Afghanistan was largelyself-sufficient in food and was a significant exporter of agricultural products, especially high-qualityfruit, silk, cotton, and other products. Wheat is grown in every region. Fruit trees (such as apricots,almonds, and walnuts) and grapevines were almost universally found as recently as 2001. Differentregions produce a variety of crops: corn, barley, rice, cotton, beans, onions, potatoes, sugarcane, andvegetables. In 1997-1998, Afghanistan was 70 percent self-sufficient in cereals. Beginning in 1998,however, a severe drought hit Afghanistan. The drought has now lessened in a few regions, andagricultural production has increased there, but the consequences of the successive years of droughtpersist and, in many regions, the drought itself continues. The drought and decades of war havemade self-sufficiency and export production a longer-term goal requiring substantial resources forcrop substitution and the rehabilitation of agricultural production. ", "One significant and complicated issue is the drug economy. The British government is the lead in this area and focuses on eradication of poppy and on the training of eradication officers. The U.S.government has emphasized providing incentives for alternative forms of agricultural production,such as cotton and grape farming. However, aggressive poppy eradication programs couldexacerbate political tensions (by terminating essential cash income for large segments of thepopulation, including powerful vested interests) and precipitate new armed internal conflicts. (74) Therefore, drug eradication programs raises significant security concerns as well.

In addition to road construction and poppy eradicationprograms, the agricultural sector would benefit from:", "Water Access. Lack of water is the most serious obstacle to agricultural production. The irrigation systems need to be reconstructed by drilling wells, rebuilding localirrigation systems, canals, and reservoirs, and promoting water conservation. ", "De-mining. Land mines remain a huge problem throughout Afghanistan. Afghanistan is believed to have one of the worst mine and unexploded ordnance problems in theworld, with 5-7 million still littered about the country. Some say it will take 12 more years andanother $500 million to remove most of the mines. (75) With over 80% of the Afghan populationrelying on agriculture for its livelihood, this is a substantial obstacle not only to refugee and IDPreturns, but to the basic recovery and reconstruction plans as well.", "Farming Resources. Afghan farmers need the means to farm: seeds, new trees to replace those killed by drought, fertilizer, and livestock. USAID has recently funded theimplementation of Famine Early Warning System (FEWS) in Afghanistan, which has long been usedin other regions, monitoring drought and famine conditions. ", "Debt Relief. In order to survive the twin devastations of war and drought,farmers and others accumulated substantial debt. (76) With opium as a significant cash crop distortingthe rest of the agricultural economy, farmers need credit and loans to buy seeds, trees, and otheritems to survive and work outside the drug economy. ", "Urban Reconstruction. The overwhelming majority of refugees and IDPs are returning to Kabul and other major cities because much of thehumanitarian and reconstruction resources are there. This urbanization trend has resulted in an acutehousing shortage and the need to invest in basic services, including water, sanitation, and power. Adding to this problem, the international aid community in Afghanistan has enabled an artificialeconomy to flourish by increasing housing rents, reducing availability, and thus making the currentsituation even more difficult. ", "Energy. As of spring 2002, seventy percent of Afghanistan's power was hydroelectric, but the long-term drought has meant that hydroelectricplants have been running at less than full capacity. In addition, years of war significantly damagedthe power network. To provide energy to the country, the Afghan government has recently signedagreements with its neighbors to connect its power grids with those of Turkmenistan andUzbekistan. (77) USAID, ECHO, and IOM have alsoprovided money for a coal mining and distributionprogram. Furthermore, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, and Afghanistan have signed an agreement to builda $3.2 billion natural gas pipeline through Afghanistan. ", "Education. An initial effort in the area of primary education has been the Back-to-School Campaign run by the United Nations Children's Fund(UNICEF). In March 2002, the Afghan schools officially opened. UNICEF's goal was to help 1.78million children return to school, but, according to UNICEF, up to three times that number may havereturned. (78) This Campaign has provided Afghanschools with essential materials, includingtextbooks, blackboards, pencils, notebooks, teaching aids, tents for use as makeshift classrooms, andother teaching and learning materials. USAID provided 10.6 million textbooks at a cost of $7.75million, as well as support for the airlift of these textbooks to Afghanistan at a cost of $742,000. TheState Department also contributed $2 million to the Back-to-School Campaign.", "While there have been many successes in primary education, other areas have received less attention and funds. For the further expansion of the primary school system, more teachers areneeded. In response to this, the World Bank has been funding tertiary education, especially theteaching of teachers. In addition, secondary education is in need of further funding. ", "Health. Inoculations and basic medical care have helped improve living standards in Afghanistan. For example, nearly six million children have beenimmunized against polio through a program conducted by the Afghan Ministry of Public Health,WHO, and UNICEF. Over four million children have been immunized against measles. Moredirectly related to reconstruction is building the health care capacity in rural areas and therehabilitation of hospitals and clinics. Many hospitals and hundreds of clinics have beenrehabilitated, especially in Kabul. With these areas receiving funding from many sources, USAIDhas turned to rural health care, including the training of midwives and planned construction andrehabilitation of up to 600 primary health care facilities. ", "Communications and Media. A key component of the coordination of reconstruction and the everyday function of the Afghan government iscommunication. Afghanistan relies on cell phone service - which works best in major cities and isprovided through a partnership of the Afghan government and a New Jersey-based company - andsatellite phones. Telecommunications is a sector attracting private foreign investment. (79) Considering radio an important way to connect the country, the United States has taken the lead theradio sector and provided technical and financial support to Radio Afghanistan.

So far the calls for a Marshall Plan seems to mean only a sustained, long-termcommitment to reconstruction, which in the case of Afghanistan, includes nation building. TheMarshall Plan for Europe was substantially different from what is evident in Afghanistan. First, theEuropean Marshall Plan would have been $103 billion in today's money spread out over four years,which is much more than the amount currently provided by the United States, even including themilitary assistance. Second, the European Marshall Plan was also a regional strategy for WesternEurope, as opposed to a national strategy.
