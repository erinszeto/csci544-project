Most individuals (or their spouses) aged 65 and older who have worked in covered employment and paid Medicare payroll taxes for 40 quarters receive premium-free Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance). Those entitled to Medicare Part A (regardless of whether they are eligible for premium-free Part A) have the option of enrolling in Part B, which covers such things as physician and outpatient services and medical equipment.", "Beneficiaries have a seven-month initial enrollment period, and those who enroll in Part B after this initial enrollment period and/or reenroll after a termination of coverage may be subject to a late-enrollment penalty. This penalty is equal to a 10% surcharge for each 12 months of delay in enrollment and/or reenrollment. Under certain conditions, some beneficiaries are exempt from the late-enrollment penalty; these exempt beneficiaries include working individuals (and their spouses) with group coverage through their current employment, some international volunteers, and those granted \"equitable relief.\"", "Whereas Part A is financed primarily by payroll taxes paid by current workers, Part B is financed through a combination of beneficiary premiums and federal general revenues. The standard Part B premiums are set to cover 25% of projected average per capita Part B program costs for the aged, with federal general revenues accounting for the remaining amount. In general, if projected Part B costs increase or decrease, the premium rises or falls proportionately. However, some Part B enrollees are protected by a provision in the Social Security Act (the hold-harmless provision) that prevents their Medicare Part B premiums from increasing more than the annual increase in their Social Security benefit payments. This protection does not apply to four main groups of beneficiaries: low-income beneficiaries whose Part B premiums are paid by the Medicaid program; high-income beneficiaries who are subject to income-related Part B premiums; those whose Medicare premiums are not deducted from Social Security benefits; and new Medicare and Social Security enrollees.", "Most Part B participants must pay monthly premiums, which do not vary with a beneficiary's age, health status, or place of residence. However, since 2007, higher-income enrollees pay higher premiums to cover a higher percentage of Part B costs. Additionally, certain low-income beneficiaries may qualify for Medicare cost-sharing and/or premium assistance from Medicaid through a Medicare Savings Program. The premiums of those receiving benefits through Social Security are deducted from their monthly payments.", "Each year, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) determines the Medicare Part B premiums for the following year. The standard monthly Part B premium for 2019 is $135.50. However, in 2019, the hold-harmless provision applies to about 3.5% of Part B enrollees, and these individuals pay lower premiums. (The premiums of those held harmless vary depending on the dollar amount of the increase in their Social Security benefits.) Higher-income beneficiaries, currently defined as individuals with incomes over $85,000 per year or couples with incomes over $170,000 per year, pay $189.60, $270.90, $352.20, $433.40, or $460.50 per month, depending on their income levels.", "Starting in 2018, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA; P.L. 114-10) reduced the income thresholds in the highest two income tiers so that more enrollees will pay higher premiums. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 18; P.L. 115-123) added an additional income tier beginning in 2019 for individuals with annual incomes of $500,000 or more or couples filing jointly with incomes of $750,000 or more.", "Current issues related to the Part B premium that may come before Congress include the amount of the premium and its rate of increase (and the potential net impact on Social Security benefits), the impact of the hold-harmless provision on those not held harmless, modifications to the late-enrollment penalty, and possible increases in Medicare premiums as a means to reduce federal spending and deficits."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Medicare is a federal insurance program that pays for covered health care services of most individuals aged 65 and older and certain disabled persons.

The Medicare program is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and individuals enroll in Medicare through the Social Security Administration (SSA).", "Medicare consists of four parts\u2014Parts A through D. Part A covers hospital services, skilled nursing facility services, home health visits, and hospice services. Part B covers a broad range of medical services and supplies, including physician services, laboratory services, durable medical equipment, and outpatient hospital services. Enrollment in Part B is voluntary; however, most Medicare beneficiaries (about 91%) are enrolled in Part B. Part C (Medicare Advantage) provides private plan options, such as managed care, for beneficiaries who are enrolled in both Part A and Part B. Part D provides optional outpatient prescription drug coverage. ", "Each part of Medicare is funded differently. Part A is financed primarily through payroll taxes imposed on current workers (2.9% of earnings, shared equally between employers and workers), which are credited to the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund. Beginning in 2013, workers with annual wages over $200,000 for single tax filers or $250,000 for joint filers pay an additional 0.9%. Beneficiaries generally do not pay premiums for Part A. In 2019, total Part A expenditures are expected to reach about $328 billion, representing about 41% of program costs. Parts B and D, the voluntary portions, are funded through the Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust Fund, which is financed primarily by general revenues (transfers from the U.S. Treasury) and premiums paid by enrollees. In 2019, about $2.8 billion in fees on manufacturers and importers of brand-name prescription drugs also will be used to supplement the SMI Trust Fund. In 2019, Part B expenditures are expected to reach about $367 billion, and Part D expenditures are expected to reach about $104 billion, representing 46% and 13% of program costs, respectively. (Part C is financed proportionately through the HI and SMI Trust Funds; expenditures for Parts A and B services provided under Part C are included in the above expenditure figures.)", "Part B beneficiary premiums are normally set at a rate each year equal to 25% of average expected per capita Part B program costs for the aged for the year. Higher-income enrollees pay higher premiums set to cover a greater percentage of Part B costs, while those with low incomes may qualify for premium assistance through one of several Medicare Savings Programs administered by Medicaid. Individuals who receive Social Security or Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) retirement or disability benefits have their Part B premiums automatically deducted from their benefit checks. Part B premiums are generally announced in the fall prior to the year that they are in effect (e.g., the 2019 Part B premiums were announced in October 2018).", "In 2019, the standard monthly Part B premium is $135.50.

(See \" Penalty Exemptions .\") In 2018, about 1.4% of Part B enrollees (about 760,000) paid this penalty. On average, their total premiums (standard premium plus penalty) were about 28% higher than what they would have been had they not been subject to the penalty. ", "Those who receive premium assistance through a Medicare Savings Program do not pay the late-enrollment penalty. Additionally, for those disabled persons under the age of 65 subject to a premium penalty, once the individual reaches the age of 65, he or she qualifies for a new enrollment period and no longer pays a penalty.", "The penalty provision was included in the original Medicare legislation enacted in 1965 to help prevent adverse selection by creating a strong incentive for all eligible beneficiaries to enroll in Part B. Adverse selection occurs when only those persons who think they need the benefits actually enroll in the program. When this happens, per capita costs are driven up and premiums go up, causing more enrollees (presumably the healthier and less costly ones) to drop out of the program. With most eligible persons over the age of 65 enrolled in Part B, the costs are spread over the majority of this population and per capita costs are less than would be the case if adverse selection had occurred. ", "As the Part B late-enrollment penalty is tied to Medicare eligibility and not to access to covered services, individuals who live in areas where Medicare benefits are generally not provided, such as outside of the United States or in prison, could still be subject to the Part B late-enrollment penalty if they do not sign up for (or if they drop) Part B when eligible. To illustrate, if a retired Medicare-eligible individual stopped paying Part B premiums while living overseas for a three-year period and reenrolled when returning to the United States, he or she would not be entitled to a SEP. This individual would instead need to enroll during the general enrollment period and could also be subject to late-enrollment penalties based on that three-year lapse in coverage. ", "Additionally, Part B does not have a \"creditable\" coverage exemption similar to that under the Part D outpatient prescription drug benefit. Except for certain circumstances discussed below, having equivalent coverage does not entitle one to a SEP should one decide to enroll in Part B later. For example, an individual who has retiree coverage similar to Part B and therefore decides not to enroll in Part B when first eligible could be subject to late-enrollment penalties if he or she enrolls in Part B at a later time (for example, because the retiree coverage was discontinued)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Calculation of Penalty", "paragraphs": ["The late-enrollment penalty is equal to a 10% premium surcharge for each full 12 months of delay in enrollment and/or reenrollment during which the beneficiary was eligible for Medicare.

", "Generally, individuals who do not enroll in Part B within a year of the end of their initial enrollment period would be subject to the premium penalty. For example, if an individual's initial enrollment period ended in September 2016 and the individual subsequently enrolled during the 2017 general enrollment period (January 1 through March 31), the delay would be less than 12 months and the individual would not be subject to a penalty. However, if that individual delayed enrolling until the 2019 general enrollment period, the premium penalty would be 20% of that year's standard premium. (Although the elapsed time covers a total of 30 months of delayed enrollment, the episode includes only two full 12-month periods.) An individual who waits 10 years to enroll in Part B could pay twice the standard premium amount.", "The late-enrollment surcharge is calculated as a percentage of the monthly standard premium amount (e.g., $135.50 in 2019), and that amount is added to the beneficiary's premium each month. The hold-harmless provision does not provide protection from increases in the penalty amounts. This means that although those who are held harmless in 2018 pay reduced premiums, any late-enrollment penalties are based on the 2019 premium of $135.50 per month. ", "Using the example above in which an individual is subject to a 20% premium penalty, the total monthly premium in 2019 would be calculated as follows (see text box):", "For those subject to the high-income premium (see \" Income-Related Premiums \"), the late-enrollment surcharge applies only to the standard monthly premium amount and not to the higher-income adjustment portion of their premiums. Using the example of a 20% penalty for a beneficiary with an income of between $85,000 and $107,000, the applicable income-related adjustment of $54.10 would be added on to the penalty-adjusted premium of $162.60 ($135.50 + $27.10 penalty), for a total monthly premium of $216.70.", "There is no upper limit on the amount of the surcharge that may apply, and the penalty continues to apply for the entire time the individual is enrolled in Part B.

Some of these beneficiaries may see a decline in their standard of living as their Medicare premiums rise.", "Once a person receives Social Security, his or her benefit is indexed to inflation and thereafter grows with annual Social Security COLAs. However, Medicare premiums are based on the per capita cost growth of Part B benefits, which reflects the growth in the cost of medical care and in the utilization and intensity of services used by beneficiaries, factors that have historically grown faster than CPI-W. Additionally, as there has been a continuing shift from providing care in inpatient (Part A) to outpatient settings (Part B), a greater portion of Medicare spending is expected to be covered by beneficiary premiums. This means that, over time, Medicare premiums are expected to represent a growing proportion of most beneficiaries' Social Security income. Since 2000, Social Security's annual COLA has resulted in a cumulative benefit increase of about 50%, significantly less than the Part B premium growth of close to 200%. The Medicare trustees estimated that average Part B plus Part D premiums would represent close to 12% of the average Social Security benefit in 2018 and would increase to an estimated 17% in 2092. (See Appendix B and Appendix C for historical, current, and projected Part B premiums.) ", "Additionally, while the hold-harmless provision provides protection against increases in the Part B premium, the rule does not apply to Part D premiums or to late-enrollment penalties. Therefore, even in a year with a 0% or a very low Social Security COLA, beneficiaries may still see a decline in benefits as a result of increases in Part D premiums and/or any applicable late-enrollment penalties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impact of the Hold-Harmless Provision on Those Not Held Harmless", "paragraphs": ["The law does not specify how Medicare Part B financing (premiums and general revenues) should be established in years in which the hold-harmless provision applies to a large number of Medicare beneficiaries. Under current law, the only way to generate enough premium revenue to cover 25% of Part B costs is to have those not held harmless shoulder the entire beneficiary share of any increase in premiums. Absent legislation such as BBA 15, the premiums of those not held harmless can therefore be significantly greater than if there were no hold-harmless provision. As the Medicare trustees pointed out in their 2010 annual report, \"(t)his approach to preventing exhaustion of the Part B trust fund account is the only one available under current law,\" despite the \"serious equity issues\" that this method raises. ", "In years in which there has been both a 0% or a very low Social Security COLA and a Medicare premium increase, concerns have been raised about the potential financial impact of the premium increases on those not held harmless as well as on the state Medicaid agencies that pay Part B premiums on behalf of low-income beneficiaries. For example, individuals in retirement systems other than Social Security or RRB may also have not received a COLA but could face significantly higher Medicare premiums than those who qualified for protection under the hold-harmless provision. Some have proposed changes to the hold-harmless provision to avoid the disproportionate impact of premium increases on those not held harmless, such as holding all Part B enrollees harmless in years in which there is no Social Security COLA or allowing Social Security checks to decline as a result of Medicare premium increases in some years. Others have proposed linking the Social Security COLA to a measure of inflation that is based on purchasing patterns of the elderly, such as the BLS's Experimental Consumer Price Index for Americans Aged 62 and Older (CPI-E) or requiring a minimum annual Social Security COLA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Proposals to Modify the Late-Enrollment Penalty", "paragraphs": ["Periodically, proposals have been offered to modify or eliminate the Part B premium penalty either for all enrollees or alternatively for a selected population group. As an increasing number of new Medicare-eligible beneficiaries must actively sign up for Medicare because they are not yet receiving Social Security benefits (e.g., their full retirement Social Security age exceeds the Medicare age of eligibility), there is concern that more people could become subject to late-enrollment penalties. For example, the Medicare Rights Center reported a large number of calls to its hotline related to transitioning to Medicare. Their report notes that \"(m)any individuals who call Medicare Rights are confused by Medicare enrollment rules, and specifically by decision-making related to taking or declining Part B\" and that \"Medicare-eligible people who do not understand Part B enrollment rules and fail to enroll in Medicare when they first became eligible may face late-enrollment penalties, gaps in coverage, and disruptions to access to needed care.\"", "Some proposals have suggested modifying the penalty provision to limit both the amount and the duration of the surcharge, as is the case for delayed Part A enrollment, which has a maximum 10% surcharge and a duration of twice the number of years that enrollment was delayed. (See Appendix E for information on the Part A premium and late-enrollment penalty.) ", "Some have also suggested that Medicare Part B have a creditable-coverage exemption, similar to that under Part D, that would allow Medicare beneficiaries with equivalent coverage to postpone enrollment in Part B without being subject to a penalty. For example, under the Part D prescription drug benefit, individuals are not subject to a late-enrollment penalty if they have maintained \"creditable\" prescription drug coverage prior to enrollment\u2014that is, coverage that is expected to pay at least as much as Medicare's standard prescription drug coverage. Creditable prescription drug coverage includes employer-based prescription drug coverage, qualified State Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs, and military-related coverage (e.g., Veterans Affairs health care system and TRICARE). ", "Other suggestions include formally training employers about Medicare coverage and interaction with other insurance; improving education on Medicare, including late-enrollment penalties, for those nearing Medicare-eligibility age; and expanding equitable relief to include remedies for actions based on misinformation provided by entities in addition to an agent of the federal government, such as an agent of state or local government, and/or an employer or insurer. ", "In recent Congresses, a number of bills have been introduced that would address some of the issues associated with the Part B late-enrollment penalty. For example, in the 116 th Congress, H.R. 1788 would limit the penalty to 15% and twice the period of no enrollment, and would exclude periods of COBRA, retiree, and VA coverage when determining the late enrollment penalty. In the 115 th Congress, H.R. 2575 and S. 1909 would have required Medicare to provide advance notification to those approaching Medicare eligibility, required the creation of a centralized enrollment webpage containing both Social Security and Medicare online tools, restructured Medicare enrollment periods and coverage periods, and expanded the eligibility for special enrollment periods for those who meet exceptional conditions as defined by the Secretary of HHS. Also introduced in the 115 th Congress, H.R. 2342 would have required that employers notify employees about the availability of special enrollment periods to obtain marketplace coverage and Medicare coverage upon termination or separation, and H.R. 5104 would have established a special Medicare Part B enrollment period for individuals enrolled in COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act) continuation coverage who elected not to enroll in Part B during their initial enrollment period. Additionally, H.R. 707 would have, among other changes, eliminated late-enrollment penalties for those between the ages of 65 and 70. ", "As introduced in the 112 th Congress, in addition to creating a special enrollment period for those with COBRA coverage, H.R. 1654 would have created a continuous enrollment period that would have allowed Medicare-eligible beneficiaries to sign up for Part B outside of the general enrollment period and to receive health coverage the following month. H.R. 1654 would have also expanded eligibility for equitable relief to those who based enrollment decisions on incorrect information provided by group health plans and plan sponsors, and it would have directed the Government Accountability Office to study problems with Part B enrollment. In the 111 th Congress, H.R. 2235 would have limited the penalty for late Part B enrollment to 10% and limited the duration to twice the period of no enrollment, similar to the Part A late-enrollment penalty.

Some have also proposed imposing a Part B premium surcharge for Medicare beneficiaries who purchase certain types of Medigap plans.

History of the Part B Premium Statutory Policy and Legislative Authority", "The basis for determining the Part B premium amount has changed several times since the inception of the Medicare program, reflecting different legislative views of what share beneficiaries should bear as expenditures have increased. When the Medicare program first went into effect in July 1966, the Part B monthly premium was set at a level to cover 50% of Part B program costs. Legislation enacted in 1972 limited the annual percentage increase in the premium to the same percentage by which Social Security benefits were adjusted for changes in the cost-of-living adjustments (i.e., COLAs). Under this formula, revenues from premiums soon dropped from 50% to below 25% of program costs because Part B program costs increased much faster than inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index on which the Social Security COLA is based (see Table A-1 ).", "From the early 1980s, Congress regularly voted to set Part B premiums at a level to cover 25% of program costs, in effect overriding the COLA limitation. The 25% provisions first became effective January 1, 1984, with general revenues covering the remaining 75% of Part B program costs. Premiums increased in 1989 as a result of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 ( P.L. 100-360 ), which added a catastrophic coverage premium to the Part B premium. The act was repealed in November 1989, and the Part B premium for 1990 fell as a result. ", "Congress returned to the general approach of having premiums cover 25% of program costs in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 90; P.L. 101-508 ). However, OBRA 90 set specific dollar figures, rather than a percentage, in law for Part B premiums for the years 1991-1995. These dollar figures reflected Congressional Budget Office estimates of what 25% of program costs would be over the five-year period. However, program costs grew more slowly than anticipated, in part due to subsequent legislative changes. As a result, the 1995 premium of $46.10 actually represented 31.5% of Medicare Part B program costs.", "The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 93; P.L. 103-66 ) extended the policy of setting the Part B premium at a level to cover 25% of program costs for the years 1996-1998. As was the case prior to 1991, a percentage rather than a fixed dollar figure was used, which meant that the 1996 premium ($42.50) and the 1997 premium ($43.80) were lower than the 1995 premium ($46.10). The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA 97; P.L. 105-33 ) permanently set the premium at 25% of program costs so that, generally speaking, premiums rise or fall with Part B program costs.", "The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA; P.L. 108-173 ), as modified by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA; P.L. 109-171 ), required that beginning in 2007, higher-income beneficiaries pay higher Part B premiums. The income thresholds used to determine eligibility for the high-income premium are to be adjusted each year by the growth in the Consumer Price Index. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148 , as amended, Section 3402), however, froze these thresholds for the period of 2011 through 2019 at the 2010 levels. In 2020, the thresholds were to return to the levels they would have been had they been adjusted for inflation each year during the freeze and again indexed to inflation each year. As this would have resulted in higher income thresholds, it would have had the effect of reducing the number of beneficiaries who pay the high-income premiums in 2020.", "Section 402 of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA; P.L. 114-10 ) maintains the freeze on the income thresholds for all income categories through 2017 and on the lower two high-income premium tiers through 2019. Beginning in 2018, MACRA reduces the threshold levels for the two highest income tiers so that more beneficiaries will fall into the higher percentage categories. (See \" Income Thresholds .\") Additionally, starting in 2020, the income thresholds for all income categories will be adjusted annually for inflation based on the 2019 income thresholds. This will, in effect, maintain the proportion of beneficiaries who pay the high-income premium.", "Due to a 0% Social Security COLA coupled with an increase in Medicare premiums, a large percentage of Medicare Part B enrollees were protected by the hold-harmless provision in 2016 and continued to pay the 2015 premium of $104.90 per month. The Medicare trustees estimated that the standard premiums of those not held harmless in 2016 would therefore need to be increased to approximately $159 per month for aggregate premiums to still cover 25% of per capita benefit costs. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 15; P.L. 114-74 ), however, mitigated this sharp premium increase and required that the 2016 Part B standard premium be calculated as if the hold-harmless rule were not in effect and the increased costs had been spread across all beneficiaries. (See Appendix D .) Instead of having those not held harmless bear the increase for all of the Part B enrollee population, the act allowed for the transfer of additional general revenues to the SMI Trust Fund to make up for the shortfall in premium revenue. As a result of this change, Part B enrollees not held harmless paid a standard monthly premium of $121.80 in 2016. To offset the increased costs, a $3.00 surcharge was added to the monthly premium in 2016 (the $121.80 premium amount included this surcharge), and will continue to be applied in subsequent years until the additional federal cost of about $9 billion is fully offset (the surcharge increases on a sliding scale for those who pay high-income premiums, up to $9.60).

", "Section 53114 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 18; P.L. 115-123 ) added an additional high-income category beginning in 2019 for individuals with annual incomes of $500,000 or more or couples filing jointly with incomes of $750,000 or more. Enrollees with income equal to or exceeding these thresholds pay premiums that cover 85% of the average per capita cost of Part B benefits instead of 80%.

Due to expected growth in the cost of Part B benefits, the Medicare trustees projected that in order to cover 25% of benefit costs as well as to build up adequate contingency reserves, the 2016 Part B premiums would need to be increased to about $121 per month from the 2015 amount of $104.90. However, due to the absence of a Social Security COLA in 2016 and the resulting widespread application of the hold-harmless provision, most Part B enrollees continued to pay the 2015 premium amount of $104.90 through 2016. With about 70% of enrollees continuing to pay $104.90, the only way that premiums could cover 25% of per capita expenditures would have been if those not held harmless (the remaining 30%) bore the entire cost increase (i.e., if the aggregate increase in premiums were spread out over fewer people). The Medicare trustees estimated that the premiums of those not held harmless would therefore need to be increased to about $159 per month. The trustees also estimated that high-income beneficiaries (i.e., those earning more than $85,000) would need to pay significantly higher monthly premiums of about $223, $319, $414, or $510 depending on their level of income (compared to their respective 2015 premiums of $147, $210, $273, and $336 per month). ", "To mitigate the expected large premium increases for those not held harmless, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 15; P.L. 114-74 ) required that 2016 Medicare Part B premiums be set as if the hold-harmless rule were not in effect\u2014in other words, to calculate premiums as if all enrollees were paying the same annual inflation-adjusted standard premium (about $121 per month). To compensate for the lost premium revenue (below the required 25%) and to ensure that the Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust Fund had adequate income to cover payments for Part B benefits in 2016, the act allowed for additional transfers from the General Fund of the Treasury to the SMI Trust Fund. ", "To offset the approximately $9 billion in increased federal spending in 2016 resulting from the reduction in standard premiums for those not held harmless (i.e., the additional amounts transferred from the General Fund), as well as the loss of income due to reductions in the income-related monthly adjustment for high-income enrollees, the law required that a $3.00 per month surcharge be added to standard premiums in 2016, and each subsequent year, until the $9 billion is fully offset. (For those who pay high-income premiums, the surcharge increases on a sliding scale, up to $9.60.) It is expected that this surcharge will be applied to premiums through 2021. The monthly repayment surcharge is paid only by those not held harmless. ", "Should there have been a 0% Social Security COLA in 2017, BBA 15 allowed for a similar Medicare Part B premium setting mechanism for 2017. However, as there was a 0.3% COLA in 2017, this provision did not apply. BBA 15 did not allow for similar adjustments beyond 2017.", "Appendix E.

In most cases, persons who voluntarily purchase Part A must also purchase Part B. The periods during which one can enroll are the same as those for Part B (see \" Medicare Part B Eligibility and Enrollment \").", "The monthly Part A premium is equal to the full average per capita value of the Part A benefit ($437.00 per month in 2019). Persons who have at least 30 quarters of covered employment (or are married to someone who has such coverage) pay a premium that is 45% less than the full Part A premium ($240.00 per month in 2019).

However, both the amount of the penalty and the duration of the penalty are different than under Part B. Persons who delay Part A enrollment for at least 12 months beyond their initial enrollment period are subject to a 10% premium surcharge. The surcharge is 10% regardless of the length of the delay. Further the surcharge only applies for a period equal to twice the number of years (i.e., 12-month periods) during which an individual delays enrollment.
