A key consideration is whether authorizing or appropriating laws will control funding. Discretionary spending \u00c2\u00a0programs generally are established through authorization laws, which might authorize specific levels of funding for one or more fiscal years. However, the annual appropriations process determines the extent to which those programs actually will be funded, if at all.\u00c2\u00a0 Mandatory spending \u00c2\u00a0is controlled by authorization laws. For this type of spending, the program usually is created and funded in the same law,\u00c2\u00a0and the law typically includes language specifying that the program's funding shall be made available \"without further appropriation.\" Many of the mandatory appropriations covered in this report are provided under laws within the purview of the House Committee on Natural Resources and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. In contrast, discretionary appropriations are provided through appropriations laws within the purview of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. ", "The frequency with which Congress prefers to review program funding can be a factor in deciding whether to establish mandatory or discretionary appropriations. Authorizing laws (providing mandatory appropriations) generally are permanent and are reviewed not on a particular schedule but rather on an as-needed basis, as determined by the authorizing committees. On the one hand, this can foster stability in mandatory funding, in that the funding mechanisms may not be revised frequently. On the other hand, mandatory appropriations may fluctuate if they depend on revenue sources that might vary from year to year, such as on economic conditions. ", "In contrast, Congress generally provides discretionary appropriations on an annual basis. This allows for program funding to be adjusted from year to year in response to changing conditions and priorities, and it provides Congress with opportunities for regular program oversight. However, this approach may provide less certainty of funding from year to year, as each program essentially competes with other congressional priorities within overall budget constraints.", "Congress has chosen to fund some programs or activities with both mandatory and discretionary appropriations. In these cases, both the authorizing laws and the appropriations laws govern a portion of program funding. This approach may allow annual review and decisionmaking on discretionary appropriations to supplement mandatory funding; it also may allow flexibility in providing each type of funding for a different purpose. However, this dual approach may be less efficient or reliable than one type of funding. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding Sources", "paragraphs": ["Congress determines the funding source(s) that support mandatory appropriations. Although many factors may influence the selection of a funding source, a primary consideration is whether the monies should come from government collections in the General Fund of the Treasury or a specific collection, which often is deposited in a special account. The General Fund is the default for government collections unless otherwise specified in law, and it contains monies under a variety of authorities. Many if not all Americans might contribute to the General Fund, for example through income or other taxes. This source might be favored for some mandatory appropriations because it allows central funds to support federal lands managed on behalf of the general public. ", "In practice, few of the FY2018 mandatory accounts for the four land management agencies received funding from the General Fund. One account that received monies from the General Fund is BLM and FS payments under the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 (SRS). SRS authorized an optional, alternative revenue-sharing payment program for FS generally and for BLM for certain counties in Oregon. The payment amount is determined by a formula based in part on historical revenue payments. Funding for the payment derives from agency receipts and transfers from the General Fund of the Treasury. ", "Alternatively, Congress may choose to fund mandatory accounts for the four land management agencies from specific collections. In FY2018, specific collections derived from agency receipts, taxes, license fees, tariff and import duties, and donations, among other sources. This approach might be preferred because the revenues derive from activities related to land management and use, especially if the collections are used to invest in the lands and communities from which they are derived. ", "In FY2018, nearly all mandatory appropriations for the four federal land management agencies were funded by specific collections. Many of these appropriations derived from agency receipts under laws that provide for the collection and retention of money from the sale, lease, rental, or other use of the lands and resources under the agencies' jurisdiction. Agency land uses contributing to receipts included timber harvesting, recreation, and livestock grazing. ", "Under some laws, agencies retain 100% of their receipts (e.g., each agency's Operation and Maintenance of Quarters account). Other laws direct an agency to retain a portion of receipts; for instance, BLM's Southern Nevada Public Land Sales account contains 85% of receipts from certain BLM land sales and exchanges in Nevada. Still other laws allow an agency to decide the amount of receipts to be deposited in a special account. The FS Knutson-Vandenberg Trust Fund, for example, contains revenue generated from timber sales, with the amount of deposits determined by FS on a case-by-case basis. ", "Federal excise taxes and fuel taxes funded (at least in part) other FY2018 mandatory appropriations. For example, excise taxes, charged on specific items or groups of items, funded two major FWS programs\u00e2\u0080\u0094Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration (sometimes referred to as Pittman-Robertson) and Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration (sometimes referred to as Dingell-Johnson). Under both programs, the taxes are paid primarily by the people who might benefit from the subsequent expenditures. For the Wildlife Restoration program, taxed items include certain guns, ammunition, and bows and arrows, with the funds primarily used for wildlife restoration programs. Under the Sport Fish Restoration program, the taxed items include sport fishing equipment; this program also receives taxes on motor boat and small engine fuels. The appropriations are used for sport fish restoration programs.", "Under licensing fee programs, land users might pay for a particular activity, with the receipts intended to benefit these users or support a related agency program. In FY2018, licensing fees were used for a major FWS program\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Migratory Bird Conservation Account. Under this program, hunters purchase \"Duck Stamps\" in order to hunt waterfowl and collectors purchase the stamps for collection and conservation purposes. FWS primarily uses the funds derived from these purchases to acquire lands and easements and to protect waterfowl habitat, with the lands and easements added to the National Wildlife Refuge System. Licensing fees also were used in FY2018 to support two relatively small FS programs\u00e2\u0080\u0094Smokey Bear and Woodsy Owl\u00e2\u0080\u0094with the proceeds shared between the licensing contractor and FS (for wildfire prevention and environmental conservation initiatives, respectively). ", "Tariffs and import duties funded some FY2018 mandatory accounts. For instance, FS's Reforestation Trust Fund receives tariffs collected on imported wood products, up to $30.0 million annually. In addition, import duties on fishing boats and tackle support FWS's Sport Fish Restoration account, and import duties on certain arms and ammunition support FWS's Migratory Bird Conservation account.", "The federal land management agencies have authority to accept donations from individuals and organizations for agency projects and activities. All but FS have mandatory authority for some or all donations. For instance, in FY2018, FWS and NPS each had a primary mandatory account comprised of the donations. BLM had two relatively small mandatory accounts containing donations for particular purposes (i.e., rangeland improvements and cadastral surveys.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Uses of the Funds", "paragraphs": ["Laws that establish mandatory accounts typically specify how the monies will be used. A general question for Congress is whether the receipts should be retained for use by the collecting agency or shared with state or local governments or other entities or individuals. For accounts retained for agency use, there are additional considerations. These considerations include whether the monies should be available for a broad array of agency activities or restricted to more narrow purposes, such as Administration priorities, purposes related to the activities that generated the receipts, or activities exclusively at the sites that generated the revenues. For shared accounts, additional considerations include how to divide the funds (e.g., among states) and whether and how to provide revenue-sharing payments or establish grant programs.

Critics contend that agency discretion over use of receipts could incentivize revenue-generating uses over other priorities, such as habitat conversation. ", "Some of the mandatory FY2018 accounts were available to be used for broad purposes. For example, the four agencies' Recreation Fee accounts can be used for maintenance and facility enhancement, visitor services, law enforcement, and habitat restoration, among other purposes. Similarly, the NPS account for Concession Franchise Fees is authorized for visitor services and high-priority resource management programs and operations. Under both of these fee programs, most of the fees are retained at the collecting site. ", "Other FY2018 mandatory accounts funded specific agency activities related to the derivation of the receipts. For example, receipts of salvage timber sales fund the FS Timber Salvage Sale Fund; the appropriations can be used to prepare, sell, and administer other salvage sales. As another example, the NPS Transportation Systems Fund is derived from fees for public transportation services within the National Park System. It is used for costs of transportation services in the collecting park units."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State and Local Compensation", "paragraphs": ["Some mandatory spending authorities require revenue sharing with state or local governments, essentially as compensation for the tax-exempt status of federal lands.

", "In FY2018, some of the compensation programs encompassed a broad land base (e.g., all national forests), whereas others had a much narrower base (e.g., the national forests in three counties in northern Minnesota). In addition, some programs specified the allowed uses of the funds, and others were not restricted. FS payments to states, for example, can be used only on roads and schools, whereas BLM sharing of grazing receipts can be used generally for the benefit of the counties in which the lands are located .", "For some lands or resources, there is no compensation. Where there is compensation, the proportion granted to state and local governments has varied widely, even among programs of one agency. For BLM, for instance, the proportion of revenues from land sales that is shared with states is generally 4% (of gross proceeds) but is 15% for Nevada for certain land sales in the state. In addition, the state share of grazing fee receipts is 12.5% within grazing districts but 50% outside of grazing districts.

For instance, in two FWS grant programs with formula allocations (Wildlife Restoration and Sport Fish Restoration), states and territories may receive a maximum of 75% of costs of projects related, respectively, to wildlife restoration and sport fish habitat (among other purposes). Some observers have viewed the combination of a formula fixed in law and mandatory spending as giving states substantial predictability of federal funding.", "Other mandatory accounts are allocated for grants through competition among projects.

FLREA directs that, in general, at least 80% of the fees collected at a park unit are to be available without further appropriation for use at the site where they were collected. In practice, NPS's policy is to allow park units that collect less than $0.5 million annually to retain 100% of collections at the site; park units that collect over $0.5 million annually retain up to 80% of collections. Funds not retained at the collecting site are placed in a centralized account for use agency-wide, including at sites where fee collection is infeasible or relatively low. NPS projects compete for funding from this centralized account, and the NPS director ultimately selects projects for funding.
