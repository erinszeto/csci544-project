Most of the R&D funded by the federal government is performed in support of the unique missions of the funding agencies. The federal government has played an important role in supporting R&D efforts that have led to scientific breakthroughs and new technologies, from jet aircraft and the Internet to communications satellites and defenses against disease.", "In May 2009, President Obama requested $147.620 billion for R&D in FY2010, a 0.4% increase over the enacted FY2009 R&D funding level of $147.065 billion (est.)

President Obama would have achieved this objective largely through increased funding for the Department of Energy Office of Science and the National Science Foundation, and, to a lesser extent, the Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology's core laboratory research.", "More broadly, in a speech before members of the National Academy of Sciences, President Obama put forth a goal of increasing the national investment in R&D to more than 3% of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). President Obama did not provide details on how this goal might be achieved (e.g., how much would be funded through increases in direct federal R&D funding or through indirect mechanisms such as the research and experimentation tax credit ), however doing so likely would require a substantial increase in public and private investment. In 2007, total U.S. R&D expenditures were $368.1 billion, or approximately 2.7% of GDP. Based on 2007 figures, reaching President Obama's 3% goal would require a 12.5% real increase in national R&D funding. Increasing direct Federal R&D funding by 12.5% in FY2010 would have required an increase of more than $18 billion above President Obama's request.", "In addition, advocates for increased federal R&D funding\u2014including President Obama's science advisor, John Holdren\u2014have raised concerns about the potential negative effects of a \"boom-bust\" approach to federal R&D funding, i.e., rapid growth in federal R&D funding followed by much slower growth, flat funding, or even decline. The biomedical research community experienced a variety of challenges resulting from such a circumstance following the five-year doubling of the NIH budget that was completed in FY2003. With the NIH doubling came a rapid expansion of the nation's biomedical research infrastructure (e.g., buildings, laboratories, equipment), as well as rapid growth in university faculty hiring, students pursuing biomedical degrees, and grant applications to NIH. After the doubling, however, the agency's budget fell each year in real terms from FY2004 to FY2009. Critics assert a variety of adverse effects of this boom-bust cycle, including interruptions and cancelations of promising research, declining share in the number of NIH grant proposals funded, decreased student interest in pursuing graduate studies, and reduced employment prospects for the large number of biomedical researchers with advanced degrees. According to then-NIH Director Elias Zerhouni, the adverse ramifications have been particularly acute for early- and mid-career scientists seeking a first or second grant. , ", "Analysis of federal R&D funding is complicated by several factors, including the Obama Administration's omission of Congressionally directed spending from the FY2010 budget request and inconsistency among agencies in the reporting of R&D. Another complicating factor for FY2009 and FY2010 is the inclusion of funding for R&D, facilities, and equipment, and related activities in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ). ARRA funds supplement funding provided to agencies in P.L. 110-329 and P.L. 111-8 . Some ARRA funding will be spent in FY2009 and the balance of these funds will be spent in subsequent years. For purposes of this report, unless otherwise noted, comparisons of FY2009 and FY2010 R&D funding do not incorporate funding provided under P.L. 111-5 .

However, RDT&E funds are also appropriated in other parts of the bill. For example, RDT&E funds are appropriated as part of the Defense Health Program and the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program. The Defense Health Program supports the delivery of health care to DOD personnel and their families. Program funds are requested through the Operations and Maintenance appropriation. The program's RDT&E funds support Congressionally directed research in such areas as breast, prostate, and ovarian cancer and other medical conditions. The Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program supports activities to destroy the U.S. inventory of lethal chemical agents and munitions to avoid future risks and costs associated with storage. Funds for this program have been requested through the Army Procurement appropriation. The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund (JIEDDF) also contains additional RDT&E monies. However, the fund does not contain an RDT&E line item as do the two programs mentioned above. The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Office, which now administers the fund, tracks (but does not report) the amount of funding allocated to RDT&E. The JIEDDF funding is not included in the tables below.

Typically, the RDT&E funds appropriated for GWOT/OCO activities go to specified Program Elements (PEs) in Title IV. However, they are requested and accounted for separately. The Bush Administration requested these funds in separate GWOT emergency supplemental requests. The Obama Administration, while continuing to identify these funds uniquely as OCO requests, has included these funds as part of the regular budget, not as an emergency supplemental. In addition, GWOT/OCO-related requests/appropriations often include money for a number of transfer funds. These include the Iraqi Freedom Fund (IFF), the Iraqi Security Forces Fund, the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund, the Mine Resistant and Ambush Protected Vehicle Fund (MRAPVF), and, beginning in FY2010, the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund. Congress typically makes a single appropriation into each of these funds, and authorizes the Secretary to make transfers to other accounts, including RDT&E, at his discretion.", "For FY2010, the Obama Administration requested $78.634 billion for DOD's baseline Title IV RDT&E, roughly $2 billion (2%) less than Congress appropriated for baseline Title IV in FY2009. The FY2010 requests for RDT&E in the Defense Health Program and the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program were $613 million and $401 million, respectively. In addition, the Obama Administration requested $310 million in OCO-related RDT&E.", "RDT&E funding can be broken out in a couple of ways. Each of the military departments request and receive their own RDT&E funding. So, too, do various DOD agencies (e.g., the Missile Defense Agency and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), collectively aggregated within the Defensewide account. RDT&E funding also can be characterized by budget activity (i.e., the type of RDT&E supported). Those budget activities designated as 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 (basic research, applied research, and advanced development, respectively) constitute what is called DOD's Science and Technology Program (S&T) and represent the more research-oriented part of the RDT&E program. Budget activities 6.4 and 6.5 focus on the development of specific weapon systems or components (e.g., the Joint Strike Fighter or missile defense systems), for which an operational need has been determined and an acquisition program established. Budget activity 6.7 supports system improvements in existing operational systems. Budget activity 6.6 provides management support, including support for test and evaluation facilities.", "Congress is particularly interested in S&T funding since these funds support the development of new technologies and the underlying science. Ensuring adequate support for S&T activities is seen by some in the defense community as imperative to maintaining U.S. military superiority. This was of particular concern at a time when defense budgets and RDT&E funding were falling at the end of the Cold War. As part of its 2001 Quadrennial Review, DOD established a goal of stabilizing its baseline S&T funding (i.e., Title IV) at 3% of DOD's overall funding. Congress has embraced this goal.", "The FY2010 baseline S&T funding request in Title IV was $11.650 billion, about $1.837 billion (13.6%) less than what Congress appropriated for baseline S&T in Title IV in FY2009 (not counting S&T's share of the $218 million general reduction in RDT&E for revised economic assumptions). Furthermore, the S&T request for baseline Title IV was approximately 2.2% of the overall baseline DOD budget request ($533.8 billion, not counting funds for the Global War on Terror), short of the 3% goal. ", "Within the S&T program, basic research (6.1) receives special attention, particularly by the nation's universities. DOD is not a large supporter of basic research, when compared to the National Institutes of Health or the National Science Foundation. However, over half of DOD's basic research budget is spent at universities and represents the major contribution of funds in some areas of science and technology (such as electrical engineering and material science). The FY2010 request for basic research ($1.798 billion) was roughly $44 million (2%) less than what Congress appropriated for Title IV basic research in FY2008.", "The House passed its version of the FY2010 defense appropriations bill ( H.R. 3326 ) on July 30. The House approved $80.2 billion for baseline Title IV RDT&E. This included $13.2 billion for S&T, of which $1.9 billion was for basic research. In addition, the House approved $1.3 billion for RDT&E in the Defense Health Program. This includes a technical revision approved on the House floor that shifted $26 million from the operations account to the RDT&E account. The House presumably approved the full $401 million request for RDT&E within the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program. The committee report ( H.Rept. 111-230 ) had recommended a cut of $50 million in the program's RDT&E account. The House voted to add $50 million back into the program, although the amendment did not specify that it was added to the RDT&E account. The House approved $214 million in RDT&E for Overseas Contingency Operations, reducing the Navy's request substantially by declaring three of the line item requests as being either non-emergency-related or as being insufficiently justified.

The bill provided $268 million for OCO-related RDT&E. The conferees basically split the differences between the House and Senate on the Army's Future Combat System funding and Aerial Common Sensor program. The bill provided $130 million for the Executive Helicopter Development program. Funding for the next generation tanker aircraft was split, with $15 million being provided as Title IV RDT&E funds in the Air Force account, and $292 million going to the Tanker Replacement Transfer Fund, from which the Secretary may transfer funds into RDT&E, Procurement, or Operations and Maintenance as necessary, with proper notification of Congress. The conferees agreed with the House on its recommendations for Joint Strike Fighter. The conferees agreed with the Senate where it disagreed with the House on OCO RDT&E funding. In addition, the conferees added $9 million in 6.3 funding in the OCO budget for a Marine Immersive Training program (transferring it from the Navy's Operations and Maintenance account).

The Senate recommended the requested level of $34 million. The conference committee recommended $160 million. As the total figures indicate, there are some substantial differences between the House and Senate versions. For example, the House sought to zero the Manned Reconnaissance Systems request of the Navy, the Senate sought to increase the request by $26 million. The Senate also added $61 million to the Air Force request for LINK 16 Support and Sustainment, which was not in the original request or the House version.

A proposed reduction of $31 million for the Infrastructure and Geophysical Division included the elimination of funding for local and regional initiatives previously established or funded at congressional direction. The request for Laboratory Facilities included $36 million for the planned National Bio and Agro Defense Facility (NBAF), about the same as in FY2009. A proposed increase of $16 million for the Transition program included $5 million for the Homeland Security Studies and Analysis Institute, formerly the Homeland Security Institute, which was funded as a separate item in FY2009.", "The House bill would have provided $15 million to the S&T Directorate to fund developmental testing of the BioWatch Generation 3 biological agent detection system. The Administration requested these funds for the Office of Health Affairs, which the House bill would have left in control of the BioWatch program other than Generation 3 development. The House bill would also have provided $10 million in the Infrastructure and Geophysical Division for local and regional initiatives. It would have eliminated the requested funding for NBAF construction and prohibited the obligation of any funds for that purpose until the Secretary of Homeland Security receives a non-DHS assessment of the risks of conducting R&D on foot-and-mouth disease on the U.S. mainland.", "The Senate bill would have provided $23 million more than the request in the Infrastructure and Geophysical Division for local and regional initiatives. It would have provided the full requested funding for NBAF construction but prohibited the obligation of funds for that purpose until 90 days after DHS completes a site-specific safety and security assessment and reports to the appropriations committees on its foot-and-mouth disease research permit procedure and emergency response plan. The Senate bill would also have rescinded $7.5 million appropriated in prior years but not yet obligated. Report language directed S&T to provide quarterly briefings to the Senate Appropriations Committee on the test and evaluation status of all level 1 DHS acquisition programs (i.e., programs with total lifecycle costs of $1 billion or more).", "The final bill provided a total of $1,006 million for the S&T Directorate, an increase of $38 million above the request. It provided $30 million more than the request for Infrastructure and Geophysical in order to fund local and regional initiatives. It provided $32 million for NBAF construction and included requirements for safety and security assessment and reporting that were similar to those of the Senate bill with an additional provision for the National Academy of Sciences to evaluate the assessment. It rescinded $6.9 million in unobligated appropriations from prior years. The conferees expressed their expectation that S&T will be \"intricately involved\" in the testing and evaluation of BioWatch Generation\u00a03, but the bill did not remove Generation 3 activities from the Office of Health Affairs. The conference report directed the S&T Directorate to brief the appropriations committees jointly with Customs and Border Protection before beginning operational field testing of SBInet and to brief the appropriations committees each quarter on the test and evaluation status of all level 1 acquisitions.", "Among the issues facing Congress are the S&T Directorate's priorities and how they are set; its relationships with other federal R&D organizations both inside and outside DHS; its budgeting and financial management; the allocation of its R&D resources to national laboratories, industry, and universities; and plans over the next few years to establish new university centers of excellence and terminate or merge several existing ones.", "The start of NBAF construction in FY2011 will likely require significant increases in Laboratory Facilities funding over the next several years. It may also result in increased congressional oversight. For construction of NBAF and decommissioning of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC), which NBAF will replace, DHS expects to need appropriations of $687 million between FY2011 and FY2014. The estimated total cost of the NBAF project, excluding PIADC decommissioning and site-specific infrastructure and utility upgrades, increased from $451 million in December 2006 to $615 million in May 2009. Decommissioning PIADC is expected to cost $190 million. In the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2009 ( P.L. 110-329 , Div. D, Sec. 540) Congress authorized DHS to offset NBAF construction and PIADC decommissioning costs by selling Plum Island. Site-specific costs of $110 million will be contributed in-kind by Kansas State University and its partners.", "Congress has been interested for several years in the role the S&T Directorate plays in testing and evaluation of large acquisition projects. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Under Secretary for Science and Technology, to \"issue necessary regulations with respect to ... testing and evaluation activities of the Department\" (P.L. 107-296, Sec. 306). Current DHS policy is that the Director of the Test and Evaluation and Standards Division (TSD) in the S&T Directorate is to establish the department's testing and evaluation policies and processes, and the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) is to administer those policies and processes. The Director of OT&E is also to report independently to the department-level Acquisition Review Board on the status and progress of testing and evaluation for any acquisitions the board reviews. At present, the same person serves as the Director of the TSD and the Director of OT&E. This dual role may blur the distinction between the policy-setting function and the policy-administration function. Congress may also wish to consider whether the ability of the Director of OT&E to report independently on programs in other divisions and directorates is affected by the fact that TSD conducts programs of its own. The FY2010 appropriations bills and the associated committee and conference reports emphasized the involvement of the S&T Directorate in the testing and evaluation of BioWatch Generation 3, SBInet, and other large acquisition programs. In particular, report language directed the S&T Directorate, not the Director of OT&E, to provide briefings and status reports to the appropriations committees.", "Statutory authority for the Homeland Security Institute (HSI) expired in April 2009. Under its general authority to establish federally funded R&D centers, the S&T Directorate has replaced HSI with the Homeland Security Studies and Analysis Institute. It has also established a new Homeland Security Systems Engineering and Development Institute. Both institutes will be funded mostly on a cost-reimbursement basis by other S&T programs and other DHS and non-DHS agencies. The FY2010 DHS congressional budget justification estimated that reimbursable obligations by the two institutes would total $122 million in FY2009 and $143 million in FY2010.", "The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) is the primary DHS organization for combating the threat of nuclear attack. It is responsible for all DHS nuclear detection research, development, testing, evaluation, acquisition, and operational support. The Administration requested a total of $366 million for DNDO for FY2010. This was a 29% reduction from the FY2009 appropriation of $514 million. The requested funding for Management and Administration and Research, Development, and Operations was approximately the same as in FY2009. No funds were requested for Systems Acquisition, which received $153 million in FY2009. According to the DHS congressional budget justification, new funds for Systems Acquisition are not needed in FY2010 because unobligated funds are available from previous fiscal years and because secretarial certification of Advanced Spectroscopic Portal (ASP) technology has been delayed. A floor amendment to the House bill added $50 million to the Research, Development, and Operations account for activities previously funded by Systems Acquisition, including $40 million for Securing the Cities. The House bill would otherwise have funded DNDO at the requested levels. The Senate bill would have provided $10 million in Systems Acquisition for Securing the Cities and $2 million less than the request for Management and Administration. It would have rescinded $8 million appropriated in prior years but not yet obligated. Otherwise, it would have provided the requested amounts for DNDO. The final bill provided a total of $383 million for DNDO, an increase of $17 million above the request. It provided $20 million for Securing the Cities in the Systems Acquisition account. It rescinded $8 million that was appropriated in prior years but not obligated.", "Congressional attention has focused on the testing and analysis DNDO conducted to support its decision to purchase and deploy ASPs, a type of next-generation radiation portal monitor. A requirement for secretarial certification before full-scale ASP procurement has been included in each appropriations act since FY2007 (including P.L. 111-83 ).

Congress provided a total of $30.946 billion for FY2010, a $693 million increase (2.3%) over the FY2009 level (see Table 8 ). In addition to the FY2009 regular appropriations, which were provided in Division F of the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 ( P.L. 111-8 ), NIH received emergency supplemental appropriations in Division A of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), also called the economic stimulus package or Recovery Act ( P.L. 111-5 ). The Recovery Act provided a total of $10.400 billion to NIH, roughly half of which was slated to be obligated in FY2009 and the remainder in FY2010.", "NIH's funding comes primarily from the annual appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies (Labor/HHS), with an additional amount for Superfund-related activities from the appropriations bill for the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies (Interior/Environment). Those two bills provide NIH's discretionary budget authority. In addition, NIH receives mandatory funding of $150 million annually that is provided in the Public Health Service (PHS) Act for a special program on diabetes research, and also receives $8.2 million annually for the National Library of Medicine from a transfer within PHS. Each year since FY2002, Congress has provided that a portion of NIH's Labor/HHS appropriation be transferred to the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The transfer, currently $300 million, is part of the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund. The total funding available for NIH activities, taking account of add-ons and transfers, is called the program level. Because the \"NIH program level\" cited in the Administration's FY2010 budget documents does not reflect the Global Fund transfer, Table 8 shows the program level both before and after the transfer. Discussions in this section refer to the program level after the transfer.", "In congressional action on FY2010 appropriations bills, the House passed its Labor/HHS bill on July 24, 2009 (H.R. 3293, H.Rept. 111-220), and its Interior/Environment bill on June 26 (H.R. 2996, H.Rept. 111-180). The House bills would have provided NIH with a program level total of $31.196 billion, $943 million (3.1%) more than the FY2009 level and $500 million over the request. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version of H.R. 3293 (Labor/HHS) on August 4, 2009 (S.Rept. 111-66), but the bill was never considered by the full Senate. The Senate passed its version of H.R. 2996 (Interior/Environment) on September 24, 2009 (S.Rept. 111-38). The Senate bills would have provided a program level total of $30.696 billion, the same amount as requested, but the distribution among NIH institutes varied somewhat from the request. From October 1, 2009, until Congress completed action on its FY2010 appropriations, NIH operated at FY2009 rates with temporary funding provided by continuing appropriations resolutions. The Interior/Environment appropriation was enacted as P.L. 111-88 on October 30, 2009 ( H.Rept. 111-316 ).

In each year since then, NIH's buying power has declined because its annual appropriations have grown at a lower rate than the inflation rate for medical research. Congress provided NIH with annual increases in the range of 14%-15% each year from FY1999 through FY2003. From FY2004 to FY2009, increases dropped to between 1.0% and 3.2% each year (except that the FY2006 total was a 0.3% decrease), at a time when, according to NIH, the biomedical research inflation rate ranged between 3.7% and 4.6% per year. The projected changes in the Biomedical Research and Development Price Index (BRDPI) are 3.8% for FY2009 and 3.3% for FY2010. Even though in current dollars, the FY2010 NIH total is 14.3% higher than it was in FY2003, in inflation-adjusted terms (converting all amounts to constant 2009 dollars), the FY2010 funding level represents an estimated 12.7% decrease in purchasing power from the FY2003 peak.", "The agency's organization consists of the Office of the NIH Director and 27 institutes and centers. The Office of the Director (OD) sets overall policy for NIH and coordinates the programs and activities of all NIH components, particularly in areas of research that involve multiple institutes. The institutes and centers (collectively called ICs) focus on particular diseases, areas of human health and development, or aspects of research support. Each IC plans and manages its own research programs in coordination with the Office of the Director. As shown in Table 8 , Congress provides a separate appropriation to 24 of the 27 ICs, to OD, and to a Buildings and Facilities account. (The other three centers, not included in the table, are funded through the NIH Management Fund.)", "The FY2010 request proposed increases of 1.1% to 1.7% for most of the ICs. Traditionally, budget requests and enacted appropriations have treated the various institutes and centers approximately equally in percentage terms, maintaining their relative sizes over the years. That pattern is, however, subject to alteration because of special initiatives or new developments in scientific or public health needs. Some past examples have included the substantial ramping up of funds for ICs doing research on cancer, HIV/AIDS, bioterrorism, and genome sciences.", "In the FY2010 request, the Administration proposed initiatives in cancer research and in research on autism spectrum disorders. Support of cancer research across NIH would have increased by $268 million (4.7%) to just over $6 billion, representing the first year of a proposed eight-year plan to double funding for cancer research by FY2017. The budget of the National Cancer Institute would have increased by 3.6%. The Administration also proposed an eight-year HHS initiative to invest an additional $1 billion in autism-related activities. The FY2010 request for NIH proposed a 15.6% increase in NIH's estimated spending on autism. Another area receiving a substantial boost in the request, at 4.8% across NIH, was nanotechnology-related research. In particular, the small program in the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) on the human health impact of nanotechnology was proposed for a $9 million (60.7%) increase to $24 million, contributing to a 3.2% increase in the proposed total for NIEHS.", "The House and Senate Appropriations Committees rejected the proposals to set specific funding levels for particular diseases. They expressed concern over establishing a precedent of congressional funding decisions made outside of the peer review system, noting that the proposed increases for cancer and autism would have absorbed nearly two-thirds of the overall increase proposed for NIH. The House Labor/HHS bill recommended an overall increase of 3.1% for NIH, with most of the ICs receiving a 3.6% increase, in line with the biomedical research inflation rate. The Senate committee recommended the same overall increase of 1.5% as the request, but provided most of the ICs with 1.7% increases. The two committees agreed on giving proportionally larger increases to NIEHS and to the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR). The final Labor/HHS appropriation provided an overall increase of 2.3% for NIH, with most of the ICs receiving increases of 2.7%. Funding for NIEHS was increased by 4.1%, and for NCRR by 3.5%.", "The two accounts in which final FY2010 funding decreased compared to FY2009 were the Office of the Director and the Buildings and Facilities account. The appropriation for the Office of the Director covers a variety of cross-cutting programs in addition to funding for OD's own leadership and management operations. Aggregate funding for OD was $1,247 million in FY2009. It dropped by $64 million (-5.1%) to $1,183 million in the FY2010 request, and by $70 million (-5.6%) to $1,177 million in the conference agreement, but only because the NIH Director's Bridge Award program was not funded. In FY2009, the program received $91 million to provide short-term awards to investigators whose renewal applications had just missed the funding cutoff; in FY2010, Recovery Act funds are available for similar purposes. The other programs managed or coordinated by OD were all proposed for sustained or increased funding. The House and Senate committees agreed with the OD request for the most part, except that the House amount, and the conference agreement, provided less for the Common Fund (see below). The conferees commented in general, \"Unless otherwise noted in this statement, the conferees expect NIH to follow the budget policy assumptions of the President's fiscal year 2010 budget and the accompanying explanatory materials.\" ( H.Rept. 111-366 , p. 1029)", "The President requested funding of up to $194 million for continuation of the National Children's Study (NCS), to which the House and the conferees agreed. Both committees noted that the cost projections for the NCS have increased substantially, and that NIH is extending its pilot phase, leading the Senate committee to defer specifying an amount for the study. The request included $97 million for research on medical countermeasures against nuclear, radiological, and chemical threats (the House committee noted its agreement); $5 million for a new program in bioethics research and training (the House and the conference agreement funded the initiative through the ICs rather than in OD); $5 million to expand ongoing trans-NIH stewardship and oversight activities; and a total of $181 million (up 2.6%) for several program coordination offices that work with the ICs.", "Also funded through the OD account is the NIH Common Fund, which supports NIH Roadmap initiatives and other trans-institute research. The NIH Roadmap for Medical Research is a set of trans-NIH research activities designed to support high-risk/high-impact research in emerging areas of science or public health priorities. For FY2010, the President requested $549 million for the Roadmap/Common Fund, up $8 million (1.5%) from FY2009. The Senate committee bill agreed with that amount, the House bill provided a lower amount of $534 million, and the conferees provided $544 million, up $3 million (0.5%) from FY2009. Some Roadmap programs that have been supported for five years are ready to transition to the ICs for continued support. The Common Fund is also supporting a number of initiatives with Recovery Act money (see further discussion below).", "The NIH Buildings and Facilities (B&F) program supports both the design and construction of new facilities for NIH's intramural research programs, and the repair and improvement of existing clinical, laboratory, and other facilities. The request and the Senate committee recommendation would have kept the B&F appropriation at $126 million, while the House bill and the conference agreement provided $100 million, a 20.4% decrease from FY2009. There will be additional spending for repairs and construction with the $500 million that NIH received for the purpose in the Recovery Act.", "Of the funds appropriated to NIH each year, about 84% go out to the extramural research community in the form of grants, contracts, and other awards. The funding supports research performed by more than 300,000 scientists and technical personnel who work at more than 3,100 universities, hospitals, medical schools, and other research institutions around the country and abroad. The primary funding mechanism for support of the full range of investigator-initiated research is competitive, peer-reviewed research project grants (RPGs). In the FY2010 request, total funding for RPGs, at $16.4 billion, represented about 53% of NIH's budget. The request proposed to support an estimated 38,042 awards, 171 more than were projected to be supported with regular FY2009 appropriations. Within that total, 9,849 awards were to be competing RPGs, 7 more than in FY2009. (\"Competing\" awards means new grants plus competing renewals of existing grants.) The House committee said that its funding level would provide support for 38,888 total grants, an increase of 1,105 over FY2009, including 10,739 new and competing grants, an increase of 914. The request and the House bill would each have provided inflation-adjustment increases of 2% for noncompeting continuation awards, as well as a 2.0% increase in the average cost of competing RPGs. Under the request, the \"success rate\" of applications receiving funding was expected to be about 21%, the same as the estimated rate for FY2009. Estimated success rates for the various ICs were expected to range from 12% to 50%, although most would have ranged from 15% to 27%. Neither the Senate committee nor the conferees commented on numbers of awards or success rates.", "Several NIH efforts are focused on supporting new investigators to encourage young scientists to undertake careers in research and to help them speed their transition from training to independent research. The Pathway to Independence program provides, through all the ICs, mentored grants that convert to independent RPGs; the House committee specified $102 million for the program. The NIH Director's New Innovator Award program provides first-time independent awards to especially creative investigators; the Administration planned to spend $80 million to support about 35 New Innovator Awards through the Common Fund in FY2010. In FY2009, NIH began giving special consideration during peer review to applications for research support made by Early Stage Investigators (new investigators who are within 10 years of having completed their terminal research degree or residency). For the National Research Service Awards, NIH's regular training mechanism, the request proposed an increase of $8 million (1.0%) to $798 million. The funding would have supported 17,742 Full-Time Training Positions, an increase of 101. Although NIH did not request any increases in stipends or other training-related expenses for pre- or post-doctoral fellows, the House bill provided funding for a 2% average increase in research training stipends. The Senate committee did not identify a specific training stipend increase. The conference agreement included funding for a 1% increase.", "Changes proposed in the request for other funding mechanisms within the NIH budget included increased support for research centers, up $40 million (1.3%) to $3.056 billion. That included support of the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSAs), funded at an estimated $467 million, including $25 million from the Common Fund. Support for grants in the Other Research category was proposed to increase by $25 million (1.4%) to a total of $1.844 billion. R&D contracts would have increased by $33 million (1.0%) to $3.412 billion, including $300 million for the Global HIV/AIDS Fund. A trans-NIH program launched in FY2009, the Therapeutic Rare and Neglected Diseases Initiative (TRNDI), was to continue at $24 million. The NIH intramural research program, representing about 10% of the NIH budget, was proposed to increase by $48 million (1.5%) to a total of $3.219 billion. The request included a proposed increase of $25 million (1.8%) to a total of $1.430 billion for research management and support. As has been the case for the past five years, no new funding was requested or provided for extramural research facilities construction and renovation. The Recovery Act provided $1.0 billion for this purpose, from which awards will continue to be made in FY2010. Funding for the intramural buildings and facilities account has already been discussed.", "NIH and three of the other Public Health Service agencies within HHS are subject to a budget tap called the PHS Program Evaluation Set-Aside. Section 241 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 238j) authorizes the Secretary to use a portion of eligible appropriations to assess the effectiveness of federal health programs and to identify ways to improve them. The set-aside has the effect of redistributing appropriated funds for specific purposes among PHS and other HHS agencies. Section 205 of the FY2010 Labor/HHS appropriations act capped the set-aside at 2.5%, instead of the 2.4% maximum that had been in place for several years. NIH, with the largest budget among the PHS agencies, becomes the largest \"donor\" of program evaluation funds, and is a relatively minor recipient. By convention, budget tables such as Table 8 do not subtract the amount of the evaluation tap, or of other taps within HHS, from the agencies' appropriations.", "As mentioned earlier, in addition to the FY2009 regular appropriations, NIH received a total of $10.400 billion in emergency FY2009 supplemental appropriations in the economic stimulus legislation, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-5 ). The funds were made available for obligation for two years. NIH's current implementation plans indicate that more than $5 billion will remain to be obligated in FY2010. The funding given to NIH included $8.2 billion for extramural research; $1.3 billion for non-federal research facility construction, renovation, and equipment; $500 million for NIH buildings and facilities; and $400 million for comparative effectiveness research.", "Activities supported with NIH's ARRA funding are being tracked on the NIH Recovery website. On a webpage about current grant funding opportunities, NIH says: \"While NIH Institutes and Centers have broad flexibility to invest in many types of grant programs, they will follow the spirit of the ARRA by funding projects that will stimulate the economy, create or retain jobs, and have the potential for making scientific progress in 2 years.\" The agency's implementation plans for the various funding categories are available on the HHS Recovery Plans website. NIH is focusing activities on (1) funding new and recently peer reviewed, highly meritorious research grant applications that can be accomplished in two years or less; (2) giving targeted supplemental awards to current grants to push research forward; and (3) supporting a new initiative called the NIH Challenge Grants in Health and Science Research (at least $200 million to fund 200 or more grants with budgets under $500,000 per year) for research on specific topics that would benefit from significant two-year jumpstart funds. NIH received about 20,000 applications in response to the Challenge Grant announcement. Another new program called Research and Research Infrastructure \"Grand Opportunities\" (GO) grants supports large-scale research projects (budgets over $500,000 per year) working in areas of specific knowledge gaps, creating new technologies, or developing new approaches to multi- and interdisciplinary research teams. On September 30, 2009, President Obama announced that NIH had awarded $5 billion in ARRA funding, supporting over 12,000 grants to research institutions in every state.

The Administration intends to double the combined R&D funding of the Office of Science and two other agencies over the decade from FY2006 to FY2016. This policy continues a goal established by the Bush Administration as part of its American Competitiveness Initiative. The 3.9% increase requested for FY2010 was less than the annual growth rate required to achieve a doubling in ten years, but that comparison is complicated by the planned expenditure of Recovery Act funds in both FY2009 and FY2010.

The House funded one hub. The Senate funded both. The final bill funded neither. A proposed 10.8% increase for advanced scientific computing research was to support additional design research on computer architectures for science and infrastructure improvements for the Leadership Computing Facility at Argonne National Laboratory. The House provided the requested amount for advanced scientific computing; the Senate provided $10 million less; the final bill provided $15 million less. In fusion energy sciences, an increase of $11 million was requested for the U.S. share of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). Press reports continue to raise concerns about cost increases and schedule delays for ITER. A revised official estimate of cost and schedule is expected in late FY2010 or FY2011.

The bulk of the agency's funding to date is the $400 million it received in the Recovery Act. Neither the House nor the Senate provided FY2010 funding for ARPA-E. The House committee report explained that this was because Recovery Act funds remain available, and \"the decision not to provide any additional funding ... does not in any way suggest a lack of commitment to this program by the Committee.\" The final bill also provided no new funds for ARPA-E.", "The request for DOE national security R&D was $3.300 billion, a 2.9% increase from $3.206 billion in FY2009. A proposed increase of $175 million for the naval reactors program included $59 million more for R&D on reactor and power plant technology, as DOE and the Navy initiate development of a successor to the Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine, and $48 million more for refueling, overhaul, and modernization of a prototype reactor plant in upstate New York. A proposed decrease of $66 million for nonproliferation and verification R&D would have resulted mostly from a shift of funding to other DOE nonproliferation activities. The request included no funds for the reliable replacement warhead program. The House provided a total of $3.307 billion, including $25 million more than the request for inertial confinement fusion and $20 million less than the request for development of environmental cleanup technologies for use at DOE defense sites. The Senate provided $3.408 billion, including $16.5 million more than the request for inertial confinement fusion, $40 million more for increased development of nuclear detection technologies, and $30 million less for naval reactor development. The final bill provided a total of $3.296 billion, including $21 million more than the request for inertial confinement fusion, $20 million more for nuclear detection technology, $58 million less for naval reactor development, and $35 million less for defense site environmental cleanup technology.", "The request for DOE energy R&D was $3.212 billion, up 1.9% from $3.152 billion in FY2009.

The increases for energy efficiency and renewable energy R&D included $145 million more for solar energy, including $35 million for a new solar electricity innovation hub; $60 million more for vehicle energy efficiency; $98 million more for building energy efficiency, including $35 million for a new innovation hub on energy efficient building systems; and $115 million for RE-ENERGYSE, a new program for education and workforce development in energy science and engineering. These increases would have been partly offset by a $100 million decrease for fuel cell technology. The request would have more than doubled funding for the electricity delivery and energy reliability R&D program, which is being restructured to reflect the Administration's goals for grid modernization; $35 million of the proposed increase would have funded a new energy innovation hub on grid materials, devices, and systems. A proposed 30% reduction for fossil energy R&D resulted from no new funding being requested for the Clean Coal Power Initiative; the department's budget documents noted that this initiative was \"already strongly supported\" by the $800 million it received under the Recovery Act. This decrease would have been partly offset by the $35 million proposed for a new innovation hub on carbon capture and storage. Within nuclear energy R&D, a proposed reduction of $158 million for Nuclear Power 2010, which is to be concluded in FY2010, was partly offset by a request for $70 million to establish two new energy innovation hubs, one on modeling and simulation and one on extreme materials. The House provided $3.104 billion for energy R&D. Relative to the request, this total included increases of $70 million for nuclear energy, $45 million for vehicle energy efficiency, $45 for fuel cell technology, and $10 million for water power; decreases of $61 million for solar energy, $27 million for building energy efficiency, and $69 million for program direction and support; and no funding for RE-ENERGYSE.

Under President Obama's Plan for Science and Innovation, the Administration proposed doubling the federal investment in three basic research agencies (NSF, DOE Office of Science, and NIST) over a period of 10 years relative to the FY2006 level. The FY2010 request is intended as an installment toward that doubling effort and is structured to build on the scientific investments funded by the 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). The Administration anticipates that the largest increases in the Plan will occur in FY2012. ", "NSF identified several strategies in the FY2010 budget request, including expanding the scientific workforce and broadening participation from underrepresented groups and geographical regions; increasing three-fold the number of new Graduate Research Fellowships awarded annually; expanding and enhancing international partnerships and interagency collaborations; performing effectively with the highest standards of accountability; and maintaining a portfolio of basic, high-risk, and transformative research across all disciplines. The NSF Director has described transformative research as \"a range of endeavors, which promise extraordinary outcomes; such as, revolutionizing entire disciplines, creating entirely new fields, or disrupting accepted theories and perspective.\" Several reports have recommended that funds be allocated specifically for this type of research. NSF contends that in the global environment of science and engineering, support for transformative, high-risk, high-reward research is critical to U.S. competitiveness. The FY2010 strategies parallel some of the goals contained in the Plan for Science and Innovation and are designed to promote research that will drive innovation; support the design and development of world-class facilities, instrumentation, and infrastructure; and maintain an internationally competitive workforce.", "Included in the FY2010 request was $5.733 billion for Research and Related Activities (R&RA), a 10.6% increase ($550.1 million) above the FY2009 estimate of $5.183 billion. R&RA funds research projects, research facilities, and education and training activities. Some in the scientific and academic communities have voiced concerns about the imbalance between support for the life sciences and the physical sciences. Research can be multidisciplinary and transformational, and often discoveries in the physical sciences lead to advances in other disciplines. The America COMPETES Act authorized increased federal research support in the physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering. The FY2010 request would have provided $1.380 billion for the Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) Directorate, a 9.9% increase over the FY2009 level. The MPS portfolio supports investments in fundamental research, facilities, and instruments, and provides approximately 43% of the federal funding for basic research in mathematics and physical sciences conducted at colleges and universities. R&RA includes Integrative Activities (IA), a cross-disciplinary research and education program that is also a source of funding for the acquisition and development of research instrumentation at institutions. The FY2010 request provided $271.1 million for IA. The IA also funds Partnerships for Innovation, disaster research teams, and the Science and Technology Policy Institute. In FY2008, support for the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) was transferred from the Education and Human Resources Directorate (EHR) to IA. NSF's FY2010 request for EPSCoR was $147.1 million, which is a part of the total IA funding request. The FY2010 request supported a portfolio of three complementary strategies\u2014research infrastructure, co-funding, and outreach\u2014for the 27 EPSCoR jurisdictions. Approximately half of the funding for EPSCoR was to be used for a combination of new awards and research infrastructure improvement grants. The remaining half of the funding was to be used to support grants made in previous years. ", "The NSF asserts that international research partnerships are critical to the nation in maintaining a competitive edge, addressing global issues, and capitalizing on global economic opportunities. For FY2010, the Administration requested $49.0 million for the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE), an 11.3% increase over FY2009. The OISE manages NSF's offices in Beijing, Paris, and Tokyo that analyze and report on in-country and regional science and technology policies and developments. The OISE serves as a liaison with research institutes and foreign agencies, and facilitates coordination and implementation of NSF research and education efforts.", "The Office of Polar Programs (OPP) is funded in the R&RA. The OPP is the primary source of U.S. support for basic research in polar regions. The NSF also serves in a leadership capacity for several international research partnerships in the Arctic and Antarctic. Research in the Arctic and Antarctic explores the various aspects of the global earth system that affect the global environment and climate. The FY2010 request for polar research was $516.0 million, a 9.6% increase over the FY2009 estimate. Increases in OPP in FY2010 are for arctic and antarctic sciences\u2014glacial and sea ice, terrestrial and marine ecosystems, the ocean and the atmosphere, and biology of life in the cold and dark. Priorities of the OPP in FY2010 include support for national energy goals, support for transformative research, and resupply improvements at the research stations. From FY2006 through FY2008, NSF had the responsibility for funding the operational costs of the U.S. Coast Guard's (USCG) three icebreakers that support scientific research in the polar regions\u2014Polar Sea, Polar Star, and Healy. NSF was responsible for the operation, maintenance, and staffing of the vessels under a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between NSF and USCG. Beginning in FY2009, the MOA no longer covers the Polar Star. The Polar Star will be refurbished by the USCG using FY2009 funds. The NSF intends to continue to operate and maintain the Polar Sea and Healy to conduct scientific research. ", "NSF supported several interagency R&D priorities in its FY2010 request. It is a lead supporter in the U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI), requesting $423.0 million for nanotechnology research. Funding would support research in emerging areas of nanoscale science and technology such as new drug delivery systems, advanced materials, and more powerful computer chips. This funding included $29.9 million for research to explore potential environmental, health, and safety affects of nanotechnology. NSF's other interagency priorities in its FY2010 request included funding for the Climate Change Science Program ($299.9 million), Homeland Security ($385.5 million), and Networking and Information Technology R&D ($1.111 billion).", "The NSF supports a variety of centers and center programs.

The MREFC supports the acquisition and construction of major research facilities and equipment that extend the boundaries of science, engineering, and technology. According to NSF, it is the primary federal agency providing support for \"forefront instrumentation and facilities for the academic research and education communities.\" NSF's first priority for funding is support for ongoing projects. Second priority is given to projects that have been approved by the National Science Board for new starts. To qualify for support, NSF required MREFC projects to have \"the potential to shift the paradigm in scientific understanding and/or infrastructure technology.\" The FY2010 request was indicative of NSF's tighter standards and requirements for receiving funding in this account. The FY2010 request includes support for five ongoing projects: Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory ($46.3 million), Atacama Large Millimeter Array ($42.8 million), IceCube Neutrino Observatory ($1.0 million), Advanced Technology Solar Telescope ($10.0 million), and the Ocean Observatories Initiative ($14.3 million).", "On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed into law P.L. 111-5 , the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, 2009 (ARRA).

The Vision includes returning the space shuttle to flight status (already accomplished) then retiring it by 2010; completing the International Space Station, but discontinuing U.S. use of it after 2015; returning humans to the moon by 2020; and then sending humans to Mars and \"worlds beyond.\" The priorities established by the Vision are now in question. It is doubtful whether the future-year spending plans provided in NASA's FY2010 budget documents can accommodate the goal of returning humans to the moon. An Administration-requested independent review of NASA's human spaceflight activities (known as the Augustine report) estimated that this goal would require an additional $3 billion per year, even with some schedule delays.", "The Administration requested $4.477 billion for Science in FY2010, a 0.6% decrease. Within this total, increases for Earth Science, Planetary Science, and Heliophysics were offset by a decrease for Astrophysics. In Earth Science, NASA is considering its options following the loss of the Orbital Carbon Observatory (OCO), which was launched in February 2009 but failed to reach orbit. Building a replacement for OCO is one of the options being examined, but the funding that would be required was not included in the request. The House increased Earth Science by $15 million and Astrophysics by $50 million; these increases were partly offset by transfers of administrative and construction costs to other accounts, for a net increase in Science of $19 million above the request. The Senate increased Astrophysics by $49 million and Heliophysics by $42 million; these increases were partly offset by a reallocation of unobligated balances from prior years, for a net increase in Science of $40 million above the request. The final appropriation was $4.469 billion, which was $8 million less than the request. Within this amount, increases of $45 million for Earth Science, $32 million for Heliophysics, and $13 million for Planetary Science were more than offset by transfers of administrative and construction costs to other accounts and an unallocated reduction of $59 million. The increase for Earth Science included $25 million, to be supplemented by another $25 million in prior-year unobligated funds, to initiate a replacement for the OCO.", "The $3.963 billion requested for Exploration in FY2010 was a 13.1% increase, as the Constellation Systems program ramps up its development of the Orion crew vehicle and Ares\u00a0I launch vehicle, successors to the space shuttle. According to NASA, the FY2010 request for Constellation Systems and the accompanying funding projections for FY2011 through FY2014 are consistent with achieving an initial operating capability for Orion and Ares I (i.e., a first crewed flight) in March 2015. It is doubtful, however, whether the projected FY2010-FY2014 funding for development of the heavy-lift Ares V launch vehicle, the Altair lunar lander, and lunar surface systems is consistent with returning humans to the moon by 2020. The Augustine report found that 2017 is a more likely date for an initial operating capability and that currently projected budgets would permit a return to the moon no sooner than \"well into the 2030s, if ever.\" The House provided $670 million less than the request for Exploration. The House committee report described this as a deferral without prejudice, in light of the ongoing Augustine review, that \"should not be viewed ... as a diminution of the Committee's support for NASA's human space flight program.\" The Senate provided $23 million less than the request, including the full requested amount for Orion and Ares I, an increase of $75 million for Ares V, a reduction for $46 million for Advanced Capabilities, and a reallocation of $52 million in unobligated balances from prior years.

This total included reductions of $39 million for Constellation Systems and $21 million for Advanced Capabilities, transfers of administrative and construction costs to other accounts, and an unallocated reduction of $52 million. The final bill renamed the Constellation Systems funding line as Human Exploration Architecture Development but prohibited NASA from terminating any aspect of the Constellation architecture or initiating any new alternative unless permitted to do so by a subsequent appropriations act.

In addition to supporting fundamental and applied science in agriculture, USDA maintains that the AFRI makes a significant contribution to developing the next generation of agricultural scientists by providing graduate students with opportunities to work on research projects. A focus of these efforts is to provide increased opportunities for minority and under-served communities in agricultural science. AFRI funding is to support projects directed at developing alternative methods of biological and chemical conversion of biomass, and research on the impact of a renewable fuels industry on the economic and social dynamics of rural communities.
