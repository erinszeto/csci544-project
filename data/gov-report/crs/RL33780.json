{"id": "RL33780", "title": "Procedures for Contested Election Cases in the House of Representatives", "released_date": "2016-10-18T00:00:00", "summary": ["Under the U.S. Constitution, each House of Congress has the express authority to be the judge of the \"elections and returns\" of its own Members (Article I, Section 5, clause 1). Although initial challenges and recounts for House elections are conducted at the state level under the state's authority to administer federal elections (Article I, Section 4, cl. 1), continuing contests may be presented to the House, which may make a conclusive determination of a claim to the seat.", "In modern practice, the primary way for an election challenge to be heard by the House is by a candidate-initiated contest under the Federal Contested Elections Act, (FCEA, codified at 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7381-396). Under the FCEA, the candidate challenging an election (the \"contestant\"), must file a notice of an intention to contest within 30 days of state certification of the election results, stating \"with particularity\" the grounds for contesting the election. The contestee then has 30 days after service of the notice to answer, admitting or denying the allegations, and setting forth any affirmative defenses. Before answering a notice, the contestee may make a motion to the Committee on House Administration for a \"more definite statement,\" pointing out the \"defects\" and the \"details desired.\" If this motion is granted by the committee, the contestant would have 10 days to comply. Under the FCEA, the \"burden of proof\" is on the contestant, who must overcome the presumption of the regularity of an election, and its results, evidenced by the certificate of election presented by the contestee. The FCEA's contested election procedure is directed at the question of who won the most votes and is \"duly elected.\" It is not the proper vehicle to challenge the qualifications or eligibility of a Member-elect. Indeed, an election contest brought under the FCEA challenging a Member-elect's qualifications would likely be subject to a motion to dismiss based on the failure of the contestant \"to state grounds sufficient to change result of election,\" or a failure of contestant \"to claim a right to contestee's seat.\" In the FCEA's adversarial proceeding, either party may take sworn depositions, seek subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and production of documents, and file briefs to include any material they wish to put on the record. The FCEA specifies that the actual election contest \"case\" is heard by the committee, \"on the papers, depositions and exhibits\" filed by the parties, which \"shall constitute the record of the case.\"", "On less frequent occasions, the House may refer the question of the right to a House seat to the committee for it to investigate and report to the full House for disposition. In lieu of a record created by opposing parties, the committee may conduct its own investigation, take depositions, and issue subpoenas for witnesses and documents. Jurisdiction may be obtained in this manner from a challenge to the taking of the oath of office by a Member-elect, when the question of the final right to the seat is referred to the committee. In the past, committees investigating such questions have employed several investigative procedures, including impounding election records and ballots, conducting a recount, performing a physical examination of disputed ballots and registration documents, and interviewing and examining various election personnel in the state and locality.", "Under either procedure, the committee will generally issue a report and file a resolution concerning the disposition of the case, to be approved by the full House. Specifically, the committee may recommend\u2014and the House may approve by a simple majority vote\u2014to affirm the right of the contestee to the seat, to seat the contestant, or to find that neither is entitled to be seated and declare a vacancy."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Constitution provides at Article I, Section 5, clause 1, that each House of Congress shall be the judge of the \"elections, returns and qualifications\" of its own Members. Under the federal system, primary authority over the procedures and the administration of elections to Congress within the several states is given expressly to the states in the \"Times, Places, and Manner\" clause of the Constitution, Article 1, Section 4, clause 1 (which also provides a residual, superseding authority within Congress to alter such regulations concerning congressional elections). Election recounts or challenges to congressional election results are thus initially conducted at the state level, including in the state courts, under the states' constitutional authority to administer federal elections, and are presented to the House of Representatives as the final judge of such elections.", "Under these constitutional provisions and practice, the House essentially is the final arbiter of the elections of its own Members. As noted by the House Committee on Administration, once the final returns in any election have been ascertained, the ultimate \"determination of the right of an individual to a seat in the House of Representatives is in the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the House of Representatives under article I, section 5 of the Constitution of the United States.\" A noted 19 th century expert on parliamentary and legislative assemblies, Luther Sterns Cushing, explained that the final and exclusive right to determine membership in a democratically elected legislature \"is so essential to the free election and independent existence of a legislative assembly, that it may be regarded as a necessary incident to every body of that description, which emanates directly from the people.\" In his historic work, Commentaries on the Constitution , Justice Joseph Story analyzed the placing of the power and final authority to determine membership within each House of Congress:", "It is obvious that a power must be lodged somewhere to judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications of the members of each house composing the legislature; for otherwise there could be no certainty as to who were legitimately chosen members, and any intruder or usurper might claim a seat, and thus trample upon the rights and privileges and liberties of the people.... If lodged in any other, than the legislative body itself, its independence, its purity and even its existence and action may be destroyed, or put into imminent danger.", "In Roudebush v. Hartke , the U.S. Supreme Court held that under this provision of the Constitution, the final determination of the right to a seat in Congress in an elections case is not reviewable by the courts because it is \"a non-justiciable political question,\" and that each House of Congress in judging the elections of its own Members has the right under the Constitution to make \"an unconditional and final judgment.\" Earlier, the Supreme Court had also found that each House of Congress under Article I, Section 5, clause 1, \"acts as a judicial tribunal\" with many of the powers inherent in the court system in rendering in such cases \"a judgment which is beyond the authority of any other tribunal to review.\"", "Under the constitutional authority over the elections and returns of its own Members, the House in its consideration of a challenged election may accept a state count or recount or other such determination, or conduct its own recount and make its own determinations and findings. While the House has broad authority in this area, there is an institutional deference to, and a \"presumption of the regularity\" of state election proceedings, results, and certifications. An election certificate from the authorized state official, generally referred to as the \"credentials\" presented by a Member-elect, therefore, is deemed to be prima facie evidence of the regularity and results of an election to the House. The consequences of this presumption of regularity would generally result in the swearing in of a Member-elect presenting such credentials to the House at the beginning of a new Congress, even in the face of a filed contest or challenge, and would create a \"substantial\" burden of proof on the contestant to persuade the House to take action that, in substance, would amount to \"rejecting the certified returns of a state and calling into doubt the entire electoral process.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "House Jurisdiction", "paragraphs": ["There are two general avenues by which the House obtains jurisdiction over an election that is challenged or contested.

In addition, the House has in the past, upon a challenge to the seating of a Member-elect, referred the question of the right to a seat in the House to the committee of jurisdiction (now the Committee on House Administration) for the committee to investigate and to report to the House for disposition.

Normally the papers relating to an election contest are transmitted by the Clerk to the Committee on House Administration, pursuant to 2 USC \u00a7 393(b), without a formal referral or other action by the House.

Sections 381-396, governs contests for the seats in the House of Representatives that are initiated by a candidate in the challenged election. The FCEA essentially sets forth and details the procedures by which a defeated candidate may contest a seat in the House of Representatives. The contest under the FCEA is heard by the Committee on House Administration upon the record provided and established by the parties to the contest.

In addition to a House-initiated referral in this manner, it has also been noted that it is possible that a petition from an elector of the congressional district in question, or from any other person, might also be referred by the Speaker or the House to the committee for investigation.

As noted in Deschler's Precedents : \"A challenge to seating a Member-elect may also be based on his failure to meet the constitutional requirements of citizenship, residence, or age for the office, and in that context is treated as a matter of 'exclusion' and not as a contested election.\" The contested elections statute specifically requires the contestant to have a legitimate claim of \"a right to such office,\" which could not be the case for a contestant who has not actually received the most votes in the election. Under the so-called \"American Rule\" followed in the House (and the Senate), no claim to a right to the office could be made by one who is the second-place finisher, even if the winner of the election is ultimately found not to be qualified to be seated. If a challenge is properly brought before the House to the qualifications of a Member-elect, and such Member-elect is actually found to lack the constitutional qualifications to office, then a \"vacancy\" is declared in the seat and a new election must be called by the governor of the state.

It is possible, although unusual, that jurisdiction may be obtained by the committee because of a \"protest\" or petition filed by an elector of the district in question, or by any other person. Although these procedures for the committee to obtain jurisdiction over an election challenge are not common, it appears that in the 107 contested election cases considered in the House since 1933, election challenges have come before the committee of jurisdiction in the House by means other than the statutory provisions of the contested elections statute on a total of at least six occasions.", "A Member-elect to a new Congress whose proper \"credentials\" (the formal election certificate from the appropriate state executive authority) have been transmitted to the Clerk of the House is placed by the Clerk on the role of the Representatives-elect.

Any single Member-elect, on the first day of the new Congress and before the Members-elect are to be sworn (that is, at the time when the Speaker asks the Members-elect to rise to take the oath of office), may object to the taking of the oath of office by another Member-elect based upon the objecting Member-elect's own \"responsibility as a Member-elect\" and/or upon \"facts and statements\" that the Member-elect \"considers reliable.\" The Member-elect about whom the objection is made is generally then asked to stand aside, step aside, or to remain seated, while the other Members-elect rise to be collectively administered the oath of office.", "Because the possession of proper \"credentials\" by a Member-elect to the House is considered prima facie evidence of one's right to the seat, and provides a presumption of the regularity of the returns of that election, the possession of the election certificate generally results in the taking of the oath of office by the Member-elect, even in the face of a challenge by another Member-elect and a request to initially \"step aside\" while the other Members-elect are sworn. As noted by the Committee on House Administration, it is only in \"the most extraordinary of circumstances\" that a Member-elect holding a certificate of election would be denied the opportunity to take the oath of office on the first day of the new Congress, that is, where \"irregularities and inconsistencies in the state process are so manifest that the result is not entitled to deference.\"", "There are, it should be noted, however, three different procedures that could possibly be followed with regard to one Member-elect challenging the taking of the oath of office by another Member-elect: First, the House could agree to a resolution to seat the Member at that time, and to determine then both \"his prima facie as well as final right to the seat.\" Second, with regard to a Member-elect who presents valid credentials and is qualified to be a Member, a resolution may be offered to seat the Member-elect provisionally or conditionally (even though those words are not expressly used) based on his or her prima facie right to the seat, by resolving to seat the Member-elect but to refer the question of the final disposition of his or her entitlement to the seat to the appropriate committee of jurisdiction (now the Committee on House Administration). Since 1933, it appears that an explicit provisional seating of a Member-elect, with express referral by the House of the question of the final right to a seat to the committee of jurisdiction, has occurred in only two instances. Third, the resolution may refer both the prima facie right to the seat, as well as the final right to the seat, to the committee without authorizing the swearing in (and seating) of anyone. As noted, it would be under only the most exceptional circumstances for the House to refuse to seat, even provisionally, a Member holding valid election credentials from the state, and it appears that this third option has happened since 1933 only two times on the first day of the new Congress, and once during the Congress concerning a special election.", "If the House decides to propose a resolution not to seat, or to seat a Member-elect provisionally, and to refer the question of the initial and/or final right to a seat to the committee to investigate, the House resolution is then put to a vote.

The committee noted that while it sought to follow the state election statutes regarding the counting of ballots, it was not bound to follow state law, because the final power of judging the whole question of returns and elections must reside in the House of Representatives, whose objective, over and above following mere technicalities of state or local regulation, is to determine the will of the electorate. In addition to the examination of ballots, the committee aided by GAO auditors may, and has in the past, examined other related documents such as (1) voters' poll list; (2) absentee applications and absentee ballot envelopes; (3) precinct tally sheets; (4) precinct certificates and memoranda of votes cast; (5) precinct registration certificates of error; (6) precinct registered voters affidavits of change of name; (7) precinct affidavits, challenges, and counter-challenges; and (8) unopened absentee ballots and applications which were rejected.", "In sum, the Committee on House Administration, pursuant to the House's constitutional authority under Article I, Section 5, clause 1, has broad power and authority to conduct an examination of an election, election procedures, and ballots in a contested election case, and to establish uniform standards and guidelines for the counting of ballots to determination voters' intentions. This authority is independent of and not related to any proceedings under the FCEA. An investigation by the committee, referred to the committee by the House, could take several different procedural routes, depending on the circumstances of the case and the matters before it. The committee, within its discretion, could decide not to conduct any investigation of its own and to proceed based on the pleadings, arguments, and evidence introduced by counsel or the parties. The committee could conduct a preliminary investigation or a limited recount to determine whether there are sufficient grounds to warrant a full-scale investigation and/or recount. In addition, if warranted, the committee could order a full-scale investigation, including a recount, an examination of alleged vote fraud in the balloting process, or an inquiry into other matters brought before it to resolve the underlying questions and issues presented in the challenge."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Ordering a Recount of Ballots Under FCEA and Otherwise", "paragraphs": ["The parties to an election contest case may, by stipulation, agree to a state recount, or may conduct their own recount, if permitted, which may then become the basis of a stipulation upon which the House may act.

A party to a contested election case who would claim that the state recount of the ballots was in error would have the burden of proof to establish such error before the committee would order a recount. The burden would be on the contestant to prove to the committee that a recount would", "show substantial fraud and irregularity, change the result of the election, and make him or her the winner.", "Moreover, a contestant arguably should exhaust state remedies in obtaining a recount under state election laws or through the state courts before requesting the committee to conduct such a recount. Although the committee has the power to undertake a recount outside of state recount proceedings when it deems it necessary, it may wait until the contestant has exhausted state remedies including state court actions. The committee, after voting for a recount, may reconsider its action and determine that such a recount is not necessary.", "Should the committee decide that a recount, limited or districtwide, is necessary, a set of stipulations is generally agreed upon by counsel for the parties subject to the approval of the committee, and the committee may issue a set of rules that would govern the recount. Stipulations made by the parties or a motion or House resolution stipulating certain ground rules could include, inter alia, such matters as", "controlling House precedents; controlling statutory and/or constitutional provisions relating to recounts, ballots; conduct of election, etc.; disputes over qualifications of voters; scope of recount; procedure by which committee counsel, auditors, or staff are to examine ballots, ballot boxes, tally sheets, and records and other pertinent documents and materials; procedure for counting ballots; decision on presence of press during counting; designation of election (counting) judges; comparison of registration books and poll books, counting of spoiled and mutilated ballots; determination of fraud and any irregularities; criteria for proper marking of ballots to determine clear intention of the voter; and allowing counsel to file objections and evidence at any stage of the recount proceedings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Application of State Law and State Court Decisions to Committee Actions", "paragraphs": ["Under the U.S. Constitution, there is a division of authority with respect to elections to federal office, whereby the states have significant administrative authority over the procedures of federal elections, that is, authority over the \"Times, Places and Manner\" of federal elections (unless Congress designates otherwise). Article I, Section 5, Clause 1 of the Constitution expressly provides, however, that each House of Congress is the judge of the elections of its own Members, and thus the House has sole and exclusive jurisdiction to make an unconditional and final judgment determining the right to a seat in the House. In light of such power, the committee is not bound to follow state law or state court decisions concerning the procedures of a House election, and may make its own determinations independently. Although state court decisions and state laws are not binding on the committee, they may be used to aid the committee in its determination of a House contested election case when they are consistent with the committee's notions of justice and equity. In 1917 the Committee on Elections explained:", "Your committee maintains that the authority of the House of Representatives to judge of the elections and qualifications of its members is infinite. Since the formation of the Government the House has often signified its willingness to abide by the construction given by the State court, in good faith, to its statutes. But the decisions of a State court are not necessarily conclusive on the House, and will only guide and control it when such decisions commend themselves to its favorable consideration.", "In short, the House has the final say over House contested election cases.", "Generally, the committee and the House \"seek[ ] to follow state law\" and state court decisions in resolving House election contests, but in certain instances, this has not been the case, particularly with regard to the validity of the ballots where the intentions of the voters are clear but that have been declared invalid for failure to follow certain \"technicalities\" required by state law for marking ballots. For example, in a 1902 House contested election case, the House Elections Committee refused to reject ballots merely because they had not been marked according to the technical requirements of a state election law. The committee ruled that it would accept those ballots where the intention of the voter was clear, regardless of a state election statute that required that ballots had to be marked strictly within the designated space. Thus, the Committee on House Administration has noted that \"in addition to the fact that the House is not legally bound to follow state law, there are instances where it is in fact bound by justice and equity to deviate from it,\" such as to ensure that \"the will of the voters should not be invalidated\" by mere technicalities of state law or regulation in instances where voters' \"obvious intent\" may be discerned. In addition, the committee has noted that the \"House has chosen overwhelmingly in election cases throughout its history not to penalize voters for errors and mistakes on election officials.\" That is, in the absence of fraud, and where the honest intent of the voters' may be determined, \"the House has counted votes ... rather than denying the franchise to any individual due to malfeasance of election officials.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Remedies Available to the Committee on House Administration Under the FCEA and Otherwise", "paragraphs": ["In the course of its investigation, the Committee on House Administration has a number of remedies available, including", "a recommendation of dismissal upon a motion to dismiss by the contestee, a recommendation on the seating of a certain candidate on the grounds that he or she received a majority of the valid votes cast, a recommendation to seek a recount and to investigate any fraud or irregularities in the voting process in various precincts, a recommendation to order the seating of a certain candidate after the committee has conducted a recount and investigation, and a recommendation that the returns from the election be rejected and that the seat be declared vacant and a new election be held.", "However, in the 1985 case of McCloskey and McIntyre , the committee noted that the House of Representatives has been \"very hesitant\" to declare a seat vacant, preferring instead to \"measure the wrong and correct the returns,\" when possible. The committee reiterated the general principle that, \"[n]othing short of an impossibility of ascertaining for whom the majority of votes were given ought to vacate an election, especially if by such decision the people must ... necessarily go unrepresented for a long period of time.\" Indeed, the committee in McCloskey and McIntyre characterized setting aside an election and declaring a House seat vacant as a \"drastic action\" that it recommended against \"in nearly every instance.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disposition of Contested Election Cases in the House of Representatives", "paragraphs": ["If a contested election case is not resolved by motion, such as a motion to dismiss by the contestee, or by other prior committee proceedings, it is generally disposed of pursuant to a House resolution following consideration and debate on the House floor. A resolution disposing of a contested election case is privileged and can be called up at any time for consideration by the House. The resolution, along with the committee report on a House contested election case, may be called up as privileged and be agreed to by voice vote and without debate.", "In some cases, the parties to an election contest have been permitted to be present during the debate, although the parties generally have not participated. In a situation where the contestee is a Member, he or she may be permitted to participate in the debate on the House resolution disposing of the contest.", "After floor consideration and debate, the adoption by the House of a resolution disposing of an election contest, whether by declaring that one of the parties is entitled to a seat in the House or by declaring a vacancy with appropriate notice to the governor of the state, essentially ends the contested election case. With respect to the former, the prevailing party is administered the oath of office and seated in the House."], "subsections": []}]}}
