In some areas, particularly in negotiating trade agreements, Congress has opted to delegate certain authorities to the President. Interest in bilateral trade flows and balances has been heightened as the Trump Administration renegotiates existing U.S. free trade agreements (FTAs) and pursues news ones, and takes a more forceful stance to reduce U.S. bilateral trade deficits, enforce U.S. trade laws and agreements, and promote what it considers to be \"free,\" \"fair,\" and \"reciprocal\" trade.", "Members of Congress have long recognized that international trade is an important engine not only of the U.S. economy, but also of the global economy. Total trade (exports plus imports) as a share of global gross domestic product (GDP) has risen from 25% in 1960 to 56% in 2017. Greater openness to trade and reforms worldwide have been linked to higher growth in productivity and real incomes, as well as to reduced poverty. \u00a0For decades since World War II, annual real global trade growth outpaced GDP growth, growing on average 1.5 times faster.

The main objective of this report is to present the current data and statistics in a way that is accessible and understandable to help inform policy discussions.

This makes it increasingly difficult to understand and interpret the implications of trade data for the U.S. economy. Thus, it is important to note that the conventional trade data that may drive policy discussions, and that are used throughout this report, may underestimate trade in services, as the data are not measured on a value-added basis and do not attribute any portion of the traded value of manufactured and agricultural products to services inputs. Intermediate services embedded within a value chain as inputs include not only transportation and distribution to help move goods along, but also R&D, design and engineering, and business services. ", "China is a good example of this phenomenon. Since initiating economic reforms in 1979 and opening up its economy to global trade and investment, China has emerged as a major center for global supply chains. Because of China's large pool of low-cost labor, many export-oriented multinational corporations have moved production from other countries (primarily in Asia) to China. In many cases, products that are \"made in China\" are actually products that are \"assembled in China,\" using imported inputs (such as components) that are designed and produced globally. Currently, the value added that occurs in China is often quite small relative to the total value of the finished product when it is imported into the United States and elsewhere, and a significant level of the profits from the sale of the product is estimated to accrue to the multinational company that owns the brand.", "To illustrate, when the United States imports such products as iPhones and iPads, it attributes the full value of those imports as occurring in China, even though the value added that occurred there is quite small. Apple Inc., the U.S. firm that developed these products, is the largest beneficiary in terms of the profits generated by the sale of its products, and most of its product design, software development, product management, marketing, and other high-wage functions and employment occur in the United States. In other words, U.S. trade data may identify locations from which finished products come, but they often fail to reflect who ultimately benefits from that trade. In many instances, U.S. imports from China are really imports from many countries. Yet, the full value of the final imported product is attributed to China, which results in what one might consider to be an inflated trade deficit figure. A joint study by the OECD and the WTO estimated that the U.S trade deficit with China would have been reduced by 25% in 2009 if bilateral trade flows were measured according to the value added that occurred in each country before it was exported. Additionally, another study estimated that 24.7% of U.S. imports from Canada, and 39.8% of U.S. final merchandise imports from Mexico, consist of value added from the United States."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. Trade Trends: Comparative Overview9", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Total Trade in Goods", "paragraphs": ["U.S merchandise exports totaled $1.6 trillion in 2017, a 6.62% ($96.4 billion) increase from the 2016 level.
