Lastly, Section 510 of the VA MISSION Act (P.L. 115-182), signed into law on June 6, 2018, authorized and appropriated $5.2 billion for VCP without fiscal year limitation, and Section 143 of this same act imposed a sunset date that is one year after the date of enactment (June 6, 2018) of the VA MISSION Act (i.e., June 6, 2019).
