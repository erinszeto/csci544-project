Autonomous vehicles are seen as a way to reduce motor vehicle crashes; for example, there were 37,461 deaths from motor vehicle crashes in 2016 and nearly all of them were caused by driver error. However, despite unanimous approval in House and Senate committees and on the House floor, the legislation has proven controversial in the wake of several high-profile accidents involving autonomous vehicles being tested on public roads.", "At present, no fully autonomous vehicles are available for public use. Many new vehicles have automated some driver functions, but all require a human to monitor the driving environment and control the vehicle. However, rapid advances in technology have made it likely that vehicles with high levels of automation will be on the market within a few years, raising questions about the adequacy of existing methods of safety oversight.", "The federal government and the states share motor vehicle regulation, with the federal government responsible for vehicle safety and states for driver-related aspects such as licensing and registration. While NHTSA has the statutory authority to regulate all types of motor vehicles, its traditional standard-setting process would take many years at a time when vehicle innovation is changing rapidly; standards envisioned now could be obsolete by the time they took effect. In the absence of NHTSA regulation of autonomous vehicles, nearly half the states have enacted laws on different aspects of autonomous vehicle deployment, resulting in a wide variety of state regulation.", "On September 6, 2017, the House of Representatives passed by voice vote H.R. 3388. The legislation, which incorporates some provisions recommended in 2016 and 2017 U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) reports, would preempt state regulation of some aspects of autonomous vehicle deployment, while providing new regulatory tools to NHTSA. H.R. 3388 would", "preempt states from regulating the design of autonomous vehicles, unless those laws are identical to federal law; expand NHTSA's authority to grant exemptions from its standards to encourage innovation; require each manufacturer to submit a \"safety assessment certification\" showing how it is addressing autonomous vehicle safety; mandate within one year of enactment a NHTSA report indicating what federal safety standards must be updated and listing its vehicle safety priorities; and require manufacturers to publicize their cybersecurity and data privacy plans.", "The legislation would also establish an advisory committee, a new regulation for rear-seat occupant alerts (to reduce infant fatalities), and a review of headlamp standards. On November 8, 2017, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation reported S. 1885, legislation that is similar in many respects to the House-passed legislation.

Highway travel could become safer as well: U.S. roadway fatalities rose in 2015 and 2016, the first annual increases in more than 50 years, and a study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has shown that 94% of crashes are due to human errors, which autonomous vehicles could reduce.

A range of advanced driver assistance systems is being introduced to motor vehicles, many of them bringing automation to vehicular functions once performed only by the driver. These features automate lighting and braking, connect the car and driver to the Global Positioning System (GPS) and smartphones, and keep the vehicle in the correct lane.

This classification system ( Table 1 ) has been adopted by DOT to foster standardized nomenclature to aid clarity and consistency in discussions about vehicle automation and safety.", "Vehicles sold today are in levels 1 and 2 of SAE's automation rating system. Views differ as to how long it may take for full automation to become standard. Some forecast market-ready autonomous vehicles at levels 3 to 5 within five years. Others argue that it will take much longer, as more testing, regulation, and policy work should be done before autonomous vehicles beyond level 2 are widely deployed.", "Technologies that could guide an automated vehicle ( Figure 1 ) include a wide variety of electronic sensors that would determine the distance between the vehicle and obstacles; detect lane markings, pedestrians, and bicycles; park the vehicle; use GPS, inertial navigation, and a system of built-in maps to guide the vehicle direction and location; employ cameras that provide 360-degree views around the vehicle; and use dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) to monitor road conditions, congestion, crashes, and possible rerouting. These technologies are being offered in various combinations on vehicles currently on the market, as manufacturers study how to combine them in vehicles that could safely transport passengers without drivers.", "While private-sector development has focused on vehicle equipment, federal and academic researchers, along with industry, have spent over a decade developing complementary sensor technologies that could improve safety and vehicle performance.

V2X messages have a range of 300 meters (a fifth of a mile)\u2014up to twice the distance of onboard sensors\u2014cameras, and radar. These radio messages can \"see\" around corners and through other vehicles.", "NHTSA has evaluated V2X applications and estimates that just two of them could reduce the number of crashes by 50%: intersection movement assist warns the driver when it is not safe to enter an intersection, and left turn assist warns a driver when there is a strong probability of colliding with an oncoming vehicle when making a left turn.

The report indicated this could be used to replace self-certification for autonomous vehicles, requiring NHTSA to test prototype vehicles to ensure that they met all federal motor vehicle safety standards. It said NHTSA would need new statutory authority and additional resources to take on certification procedures now handled by manufacturers. Imminent hazard authority to permit NHTSA to take immediate action to curtail serious safety risks that could harm the public. The Obama Administration unsuccessfully argued that this new tool be included in the 2015 surface transportation bill. Expanded exemption authority for autonomous vehicles. The report recommended raising the current limit of 2,500 vehicles that can be exempted from federal safety standards in order to provide a larger database of real-world experience for analyzing on-road safety readiness of exempted vehicles. The report described several alternative ways in which an expanded exemption could operate, and noted that \"it would be important to guard against overuse of the authority such that exemptions might displace rulemaking as the de facto primary method of regulating motor vehicles and equipment.\" Enhanced data collection tools allowing NHTSA to utilize the large amounts of data collected by autonomous vehicles. One example would be to employ event data recorders\u2014now used in a limited way on nearly all motor vehicles to record vehicle and driver information in the seconds before a crash\u2014for use in autonomous vehicles to identify safety-related defects.

A Tesla Model S, which was reportedly using automated controls, was involved in a nonfatal crash with a stationary fire truck in Utah on May 11, 2018. The NTSB is investigating these accidents, as it did with a 2016 fatality in Florida involving a Tesla vehicle operating with automated controls.", "Although H.R. 3388 passed the House of Representatives without objection and its Senate counterpart, S. 1885 , was ordered reported by voice vote of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, these subsequent developments have delayed further action. Five Senators, including three members of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, wrote to Senator John Thune, the committee's chairman, in March 2018 seeking changes to provisions governing state preemption, vehicle safety issues, cybersecurity, consumer privacy, and regulation of partially automated vehicles."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Preemption of State and Local Laws", "paragraphs": ["As there are currently few federal standards for autonomous vehicles, some states have begun enacting their own rules. This represents a departure from the traditional arrangement leaving regulation of vehicles to the federal government and authority over driver-related matters to the states. Both bills seek to identify a new regulatory arrangement by preempting new state and local safety standards for autonomous vehicles, but state and local governments have sought a role in federal advisory committees, notification of proposed exemptions from Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, and clarification that traditional state and local authority over matters such as enforcing traffic laws will not be infringed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Vehicle Safety", "paragraphs": ["Both H.R. 3388 and S. 1885 would allow large increases in the number of vehicles that could be exempted from NHTSA's Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. The bills do not specify time limits on such exemptions and do not require that NHTSA review them after issuance, raising concerns that pedestrians and passengers in autonomous vehicles may not have the same level of protection as they do in conventional vehicles, current crashworthiness standards may be suspended for autonomous vehicles, and too many exempt vehicles will be allowed on the roads."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cybersecurity and Consumer Privacy", "paragraphs": ["Although both pending bills contain cybersecurity provisions, these call for manufacturers to address cybersecurity without specific federal involvement. Some groups have called for the law to direct NHTSA to establish cybersecurity standards for all autonomous vehicles in Levels 2 through 5, as well as standards to require that backup drivers in test vehicles are fully engaged and not distracted. Another proposal would require NHTSA to establish a publicly available autonomous vehicle database that consumers and researchers could search by vehicle identification numbers (VINs)."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
