For example, if 100,000 people are each willing to pay an average of $50 to reduce a 1 in 100,000 risk of dying from a particular risk, then the VSL for the population relative to that risk is $5 million ($50 times 100,000).", "The monetization of regulatory health benefits is often controversial, and the process by which federal agencies do so is not widely understood.

Circular A-4 says that VSLs should not vary by age, but recommends that agencies consider providing estimates in terms of both VSLs and the value of statistical life years (VSLY) extended. The circular says that agencies should use larger VSLYs for senior citizens, but does not specify how much larger or what constitutes a \"senior citizen.\" When the benefits and costs of a rule are expected to occur at different times, the circular says agencies should compare them in \"present values\" using both a 3% and a 7% discount rate.", "Some federal agencies have written policies on the monetization of expected health benefits, and those policies differ in some respects. For example, in 2009, the Department of Transportation's (DOT) VSL was $6.0 million while the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) VSL was nearly $7.9 million. Other agencies tended to use the DOT or EPA VSLs, or used VSLs that they or other agencies have used in previous rules. DOT's policy established the value of injuries prevented as percentages of the VSL, whereas EPA's policy does not recommend particular values for injuries or illnesses.", "In more than 20 final rules that were issued between 2007 and 2009, federal agencies used somewhat different VSLs, and used VSL information in different ways. The agencies often compared monetized health benefits with costs to determine whether to regulate, but in some cases the agencies used VSL estimates in \"break-even\" analyses (showing at what point the value of the health benefits equals the cost), or to rule out a regulatory option. The agencies sometimes used lower and higher VSLs, and sometimes used multiple discount rates, in sensitivity analyses. Some of the rules illustrated that the size of the VSL used can affect whether a rule is expected to produce positive net benefits.

The number of statistical lives saved is a function of the size of the population involved and the size of the risk.

Bush Administration's \"Clear Skies\" initiative ($2.3 million per statistical life for older people versus $3.7 million for younger people). Using the lower VSL for older people in a \"sensitivity analysis\" had the effect of lowering the annual estimated benefits of the Clear Skies initiative by more than $13 billion from the base estimate. After criticisms from some interest groups and Members of Congress, the EPA administrator announced that the age adjustment factor (which had been characterized by critics as a \"senior death discount\") would no longer be used. The OIRA administrator later issued a memorandum to the President's Management Council advising analysts at EPA and other federal agencies to discontinue the use of age adjustment factors in VSL analysis.

", "Some observers have criticized the use of VSLY as discriminatory against older people, for older people have shorter life expectancies and, therefore, lower cumulative values of life than younger people. They assert that the use of VSLYs can have the same bottom-line effect as using a lower VSL for older people (i.e., causing lower values being placed on mortality risks to the old). This effect can occur even if a much larger VSLY is used for senior citizens. For example, an agency could use a $400,000 VSLY for those 65 years of age or older with an average life expectancy of 15 years, yielding an effective VSL of $6 million. However, using a VSLY of only $200,000 for younger citizens with an average life expectancy of 40 years yields an effective VSL of $8 million.", "Others have voiced strong support for the use of VSLY in agencies' regulatory analyses, with some preferring its use over VSLs. For example, current OIRA administrator Cass Sunstein wrote the following in 2004 (five years before he became administrator in 2009):", "My simplest claim in this Essay is that in terms of welfare, it is fully appropriate to focus on life-years, not merely lives, and that both academic and public criticisms of the life years approach are misconceived. The reasons for this conclusion are simple. No program literally \"saves\" lives; life-extension is always what is at issue. If the goal is to promote people's welfare by lengthening their lives, a regulation that saves five hundred life-years (and, let us say, twenty-five people) is, other things being equal, better than a regulation that saves fifty life-years (also, let us say, twenty-five people). A program that saves younger people is better, in this sense, than an otherwise identical program that saves older people\u2014a statement that seems controversial only if we see life as a snapshot in which people are frozen at their current points in the age distribution.", "Sunstein goes on to suggest that, when \"willingness to pay\" is used as part of a benefit-cost analysis, \"primary attention should be paid to VSLY rather than VSL.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Discount Rates", "paragraphs": ["In many instances, the benefits and the costs of a regulation are expected to occur at different times. For example, EPA may require that oil refineries spend money immediately to reduce a certain type of air pollution, but the anticipated reductions in pollution-related deaths and illnesses may not be expected to occur until years or even decades later. In such situations, Circular A-4 states that \"a discount factor should be used to adjust the estimated benefits and costs for differences in timing.\" The circular cites three primary rationales for discounting:", "(a) Resources that are invested will normally earn a positive return, so current consumption is more expensive than future consumption, since you are giving up that expected return on investment when you consume today.", "(b) Postponed benefits also have a cost because people generally prefer present to future consumption. They are said to have positive time preference.", "(c) Also, if consumption continues to increase over time, as it has for most of U.S. history, an increment of consumption will be less valuable in the future than it would be today, because the principle of diminishing marginal utility implies that as total consumption increases, the value of a marginal unit of consumption tends to decline. ", "Discounted benefits or costs are sometimes referred to as \"discounted present values,\" or simply \"present values.\" Circular A-4 states that costs and benefits can be compared to determine net benefits only when they have been discounted to present values, and says that agencies should provide estimates of net benefits in regulatory analyses using both a 3% and a 7% discount rate. However, noting that the 7% rate is \"the average before-tax rate of return to private capital in the U.S. economy,\" the circular also says that the 7% rate \"is the appropriate discount rate whenever the main effect of a regulation is to displace or alter the use of capital in the private sector.\"", "Some observers assert that while discounting makes sense in financial decision making (e.g., $100 received today is worth more than $100 received 10 years from now), the use of discounting in health, safety, and environmental regulation is inappropriate in that it diminishes the value of lives saved in the future. For example, they argue, using a 3% discount rate, $100 million in monetized \"statistical lives\" saved 20 years from now has a discounted present value of just $55 million. Using a 5% discount rate, $100 million 20 years from now has a present value of only $38 million.

It goes on to say that more integrated measures of effectiveness, such as the number of \"equivalent lives\" saved or \"quality-adjusted life years\" saved, have the advantage of accounting for a rule's impact on both morbidity (i.e., nonfatal illness, injury, and impairment of the quality of life) as well as premature death, although such measures also have certain disadvantages (e.g., assumptions about individual preferences).

For example, if a rule is expected to cost $100 million, at a VSL of $5 million, the rule would only have to prevent 20 deaths for the benefits to equal the costs (assuming that prevented premature mortalities are the only benefits).

The circular also suggests that agencies \"consider\" providing estimates of both VSL and VSLY, but does not require that agencies do so. It says that agencies should do a cost-effectiveness analysis \"wherever possible,\" and should do a break-even analysis when the agencies conclude that non-quantified benefits are \"likely to be important.\" More definitive government-wide requirements would help ensure that agencies' policies and practices are more consistent, but doing so could prevent agencies from tailoring those policies and practices to the particular types of risk and population at issue in their rules. ", "Circular A-4 does require agencies to take some specific actions, but some of those requirements could arguably be updated or clarified. For example, the circular requires agencies to discount future costs or benefits to present values, and says that agencies should use discount rates of both 3% and 7%. The circular says that the 7% rate is the \"average before-tax rate of return to private capital in the U.S. economy,\" and that 7% is the \"appropriate discount rate whenever the main effect of a regulation is to displace or alter the use of capital in the private sector.\" While the average pre-tax rate of return may have been 7% in September 2003 when Circular A-4 was issued, rates of return have fallen sharply in recent years. An appendix to Circular A-94 (OMB's basic guidance on discount rates) has reduced discount rates used in other types of analyses in recent years, but specifically indicates that those reduced rates are not to be used in regulatory benefit-cost analyses. The most recent OMB update of the discount rate in December 2009 placed the 30-year real interest rate on Treasury notes and bonds at 2.7%.", "Also, although Circular A-4 states that agencies should use a larger VSLY estimate for senior citizens, it does not indicate how much larger the value should be, or at what age individuals should be considered \"senior citizens.\" As a result, variations could occur in which two agencies addressing similar types of risk for similar populations could reach very different conclusions regarding whether a particular regulatory approach is advisable.
