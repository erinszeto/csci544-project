Programs that deal with U.S. agricultural exports are a major focus of Title III, the trade title, in the new omnibus farm bill, the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-246, H.R. 6124). The enacted farm bill repeals the major U.S. export subsidy program, and reauthorizes and changes a number of programs that assist with financing U.S. agricultural exports or that help develop markets overseas. Changes include modifying export credit guarantee programs to conform with U.S. commitments in the World Trade Organization (WTO), making organic products eligible for export market development programs, and increasing the funds available to address sanitary and phytosanitary barriers to U.S. specialty crop exports.", "International food aid programs are the other major focus of the farm bill trade title.

Some in Congress have criticized programs that assist with exports as corporate welfare; others suggest that private entities could and should themselves finance export activities. The 2008 farm bill extends funding authority for credit guarantees and export market development through FY2012. The enacted farm law repeals legislative authority for the major export subsidy program, but extends authority for a smaller program that subsidizes dairy product exports. Funded by using the borrowing authority of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), the farm bill agricultural export programs are administered by the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CCC Export Credit Guarantees", "paragraphs": ["CCC export credit guarantees assure payments for commercial financing of the sale of U.S. agricultural exports. If a foreign buyer defaults on the debt financing incurred, the CCC assumes the debt.

GSM-102 guaranteed short-term (up to 3 years) financing of U.S. farm products; GSM-103 guaranteed longer-term (3-10 years) financing. The Supplier Credit Guarantee Program (SCGP) guaranteed very short-term (up to 1 year) financing of exports. The Facilities Financing Guarantee Program (FFGP) guaranteed financing of goods and services exported from the United States to improve or establish agriculture-related facilities in emerging markets.", "In 2006, FAS suspended operation of the GSM-103 program. The suspension was in response to a WTO dispute panel decision in a case brought by Brazil against U.S. cotton policy. The panel ruled that GSM programs were prohibited export subsidies because they did not recover their operating costs. Also FAS suspended the SCGP in FY2006, largely because of a high rate of defaulted obligations and evidence of fraud. In its farm bill proposals, the Administration requested that Congress formally repeal legislative authorities for GSM-103 and the SCGP. The Administration also requested that Congress lift the statutory 1% cap on loan origination fees for GSM-102,which the WTO cited as a subsidy element in the operation of the export credit guarantee programs.", "The 2008 farm bill repeals authority for the SCGP, the GSM-103 intermediate credit guarantee, and the 1% cap on loan origination fees for the GSM-102 program. The new farm bill caps the credit subsidy for the program at $40 million annually. The amount of GSM-102 credit that CCC must make available each year is set at not less than $5.5 billion, but the $40 million credit subsidy cap, according to the manager's statement accompanying the bill, is expected to finance $4 billion annually in export credit guarantees.", "The 2008 farm bill extends authority for the FFGP to FY2012. It also provides that the Secretary of Agriculture may waive requirements that U.S. goods be used in the construction of a facility under this program, if such goods are not available or their use is not practicable.
