The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct) designates FERC as the lead agency for coordinating \"all applicable Federal authorizations\" and for National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance in reviewing pipeline certificate applications.", "There are no statutory time limits within which FERC must complete its certificate review process. However, EPAct authorizes FERC to establish a schedule for all related federal authorizations and provides for judicial petition if an agency fails to comply with that schedule. Congress included these provisions in EPAct to address concerns that some interstate gas pipeline and other energy infrastructure approvals were being unduly delayed by a lack of coordination or insufficient action among agencies involved in the certification process. FERC has promulgated regulations requiring certificate-related final decisions from other agencies no later than 90 days after the commission issues its final environmental document.", "Notwithstanding the EPAct provisions, there is continuing concern by some in the gas industry and in Congress that FERC review of pipeline certificate applications can still take too long. The Natural Gas Pipeline Permitting Reform Act (H.R. 161) seeks to expedite the federal review of certificate applications by imposing deadlines on the agencies involved. H.R. 161 would impose an explicit 12-month deadline on FERC certificate reviews for projects using FERC's pre-filing procedures and would codify the commission's 90-day regulatory deadline for any certificate-related agency decisions. Any agency decision not meeting the 90-day deadline would be approved by default.", "The optimal time for any deadline that Congress might impose on FERC or cooperating agencies is open to debate. The 12-month deadline in H.R. 161 would be approximately the same as the average FERC certificate review time today. However, 12 months could represent a reduction in the review time that might be expected for atypically lengthy or complex pipeline projects. In light of FERC's recent record approving new gas pipelines, FERC commissioners have been neutral or modestly supportive towards legislative proposals for stronger certificate review authorities. However, deadlines imposed on FERC or cooperating agencies could raise the possibility that they might deny permits for some projects solely on the grounds that they lack sufficient time for an adequate review. The ability of FERC and any other federal or state agencies it works with to expedite their parts of certificate review to meet an expedited schedule may be limited by available resources."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The United States' supply of natural gas is growing due to technological improvements, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, which have increased producers' ability to extract natural gas from shale formations. Shale gas is projected to become the dominant source of the U.S. natural gas supply by 2040. The growth in U.S. shale gas production requires the expansion of natural gas pipeline infrastructure at the local level (to extract and gather the gas) and at the national level to transport natural gas from producing regions to consuming markets, typically in other states. Over 300,000 miles of interstate transmission pipeline already transport natural gas across the United States. However, if the growth in U.S. shale gas continues as projected, the requirement for new pipelines could be substantial. For example, an analysis by the INGAA Foundation, a pipeline industry research organization, estimates that the total cost of new gas gathering and transmission pipelines, including storage, could average over $8 billion per year and total over $200 billion through 2035.

Thus, companies seeking to build interstate natural gas pipelines must first obtain certificates of public convenience and necessity from FERC.

The commission established the pre-filing process to encourage the pipeline industry to engage in early project-development involvement with the relevant public and government agencies. Through this process a developer notifies all stakeholders\u2014including state, local, and other federal agencies, and potentially affected property owners\u2014about a proposed project so that the developer and commission staff can provide a forum to hear stakeholder concerns. The pipeline developer may then incorporate proposed environmental mitigation measures into the project design, taking into account stakeholder input. The expectation is that the pre-filing will improve a developer's proposal and avoid problems during the review of a subsequent FERC certificate application.", "The pre-filing process involves a set of specific activities by the developer. These activities would typically include the study of potential project sites, identifying stakeholders, and holding an open house for stakeholders to discuss the project. At the conclusion of pre-filing, the developer conducts pipeline route studies and field surveys to develop a final application and submit it to FERC. Concurrent with the developer's activities, FERC staff participate in the open house and publish in the Federal Register a Notice of Intent for Preparation of an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement (40 CFR \u00a71508.22), opening a scoping period to seek public comments. FERC consults with interested stakeholders, including government agencies, and also holds public scoping meetings and site visits in the proposed project area.", "Although pre-filing precedes a certificate application, it is, nonetheless, part of the regulatory process and requires a written request to FERC's Office of Energy Projects. Developers wishing to begin the pre-filing process must do so seven to eight months prior to filing a certificate application. If the commission approves pre-filing, it will issue to the developer a pre-filing docket number establishing an official public record associated with the proposed pipeline project. There is, however, no provision at this stage for third parties to become formal \"intervenors\" in the pre-filing process, further discussed below.

Among other requirements, the application must contain a description of the proposed pipeline, route maps, construction plans, schedules, and a list of other statutory and regulatory requirements, such as permits needed from other agencies. The application must also include environmental reports analyzing route alternatives and studies of potential environmental impacts (on water, plants, and wildlife), cultural resources, socioeconomics, soils, geology, aesthetic resources, and land use. Upon receiving an application, the commission issues a public Notice of Application for authorization to construct and operate a new pipeline in the Federal Register and begins the application review process. ", "FERC's decision whether to grant or deny a pipeline certificate is based upon a determination whether the pipeline project would be in the public interest. FERC accounts for several factors, including a project's potential impact on pipeline competition, the possibility of overbuilding, subsidization by existing customers, potential environmental impacts, avoiding the unnecessary use of eminent domain, and other considerations. FERC may also take into account safety concerns, but generally defers to the Department of Transportation, which has primary authority to regulate pipeline safety under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 and subsequent acts. Of the factors above, environmental review typically comprises the bulk of FERC's review. Key aspects of this review process are illustrated in Figure 1 and further discussed below.

NEPA requires federal agencies to consider the potential environmental impacts of an action (e.g., granting a pipeline certificate) and to inform the public of those potential impacts before proceeding with that action. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-58 , EPAct) designates FERC as the lead agency for coordinating NEPA compliance and \"all applicable Federal authorizations\" in reviewing pipeline certificate applications (\u00a7313(b)). ", "If the applicant did not pre-file, FERC begins the environmental review process by publishing a Notice of Intent for Preparation of an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement. In reviewing environmental impacts associated with a certificate, the commission typically prepares an environmental assessment (EA), which is \"a concise public document\" intended to \"briefly provide sufficient evidence and analysis\" to determine whether a finding of no significant impact can be issued (40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a71508.9). If the EA determines impacts are significant, a more extensive and detailed environmental impact statement (EIS) must be prepared (42 U.S.C. \u00a74332(C)). If FERC determines a project falls within a category of activities that has already been found to have no significant environmental impact, the commission may classify it as a \"categorical exclusion.\" For example, one of FERC's categorical exclusions allows certain pipeline construction and modification projects under \"blanket\" certificate applications and prior notice filings (18 C.F.R \u00a7380.4a(21)). As such, they are categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare an EIS or EA (18 C.F.R \u00a7380.4a).", "When an EIS is required, it is generally prepared in two stages: a draft and final EIS. Among other requirements, the EIS must include a statement of the purpose and need for the proposed project, a description of all reasonable alternatives to meet that purpose and need, a description of the environment that would be affected by those alternatives, and an analysis of the direct and indirect effects of the alternatives, including cumulative impacts. In preparing an EIS, FERC is the \"lead agency\" required to obtain input from other \"cooperating agencies\" with jurisdiction by law or with special expertise regarding any environmental impact associated with the project (40 C.F.R. \u00a71508.5). Cooperating agencies for a pipeline project often include the Environmental Protection Agency; the Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration; the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service; and the Army Corps of Engineers, among others.", "After FERC staff complete their environmental analysis and cooperating agency consultations regarding a certificate application, the commission issues a draft EIS that will include its initial recommendations for approval or denial of the pipeline certificate. Issuance of the draft EIS also begins a public comment period of at least 45 days, during which FERC will hold public meetings in the proposed project area. Notice of the availability of the draft EIS for public comment and the times and locations of public meetings are published in the Federal Register . ", "Although FERC considers all public comments in its application review, simply filing comments does not make a commentor a party to the certificate proceeding. Only intervenors to the proceeding have the right to file briefs, attend hearings, and appeal the commission's decision regarding the certificate. They may also challenge final commission actions in the U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal. Any person seeking to become a party to the proceeding must file a motion to intervene pursuant to the commission's rules (18 C.F.R. \u00a7385.214). Interevenors receive the certificate applicant's filings and other FERC documents related to the case, as well as materials filed by other interested parties.

A FERC certificate confers on the developer eminent domain authority (15 U.S.C. \u00a7717f(h)). Also, federal law preempts any state or local law that duplicates or obstructs that federal law (e.g., siting or zoning) relevant to the project. In this way a FERC certificate provides a pipeline developer with the authority to secure property rights to lay the pipeline if the developer cannot secure the necessary rights-of-way from landowners through negotiation. In practice, however, eminent domain authority is considered a last resort and is seldom used by developers.", "Although a FERC certificate authorizes a pipeline under the Natural Gas Act, it cannot preempt other federal laws that may apply\u2014such as the Endangered Species Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act, or the Clean Water Act\u2014so any requirements under other federal statutes must still be met by the developer. These may include, for example, securing authorizations for water crossings from the Army Corps of Engineers, permission to cross federal lands from the Bureau of Land Management, and other federal approvals.

Under EPAct, the possibility of judicial action is the only consequence of failing to meet FERC's deadlines\u2014and it may not be sufficient. A December 2012 study by the INGAA Foundation concluded that, despite the schedule provisions in EPAct 2005 intended to expedite the review of FERC certificate applications for gas pipelines, \"anecdotal evidence has suggested that the time required to secure regulatory approvals for such projects is increasing.\" The study reported that nearly 20% of FERC certifications in the study sample were delayed 90 days or longer beyond FERC's agency deadline. According to the report, few developers have petitioned the courts to compel agency compliance with FERC's 90-day deadline, perhaps because that process, like any litigation, can be costly and time-consuming as well, with its own sources of delay.", "Notwithstanding the findings of the INGAA Foundation study, whether FERC's existing authorities and process for pipeline certification adequately meet the needs of the market for new pipeline infrastructure is open to debate. A February 2013 Government Accountability Office (GAO) study of FERC pipeline certificate reviews reported that the average time from pre-filing to certification was 558 days (18.6 months), and the review time was 225 days (7.5 months) for projects\u2014typically smaller ones\u2014that skipped pre-filing and began at the application phase. However, the pre-filing process (18 CFR \u00a7157.21) takes place prior to a developer's applying to FERC for a pipeline certificate, which is when the 12-month \"clock\" under H.R. 161 would start. Unfortunately, the GAO study did not report how many of the 558 days for the pre-filed applications were after the applications were actually filed. In 2004 regulatory guidance, FERC states that developers wishing to begin the pre-filing process must do so at least seven months (210 days) prior to filing a certificate application. Subtracting an estimated 210-day pre-filing period from the 558 days reported by GAO for the whole process suggests a post-application review period of at most 348 days, or about 11.6 months, on average, for projects that pre-filed.", "As Figure 2 shows, federal and state agencies have approved numerous pipelines associated with U.S. shale gas production since EPAct.

Both commissioners also expressed support for greater FERC authority to enforce its certificate review deadlines. Outgoing FERC Chairman Jon Wellinghoff reportedly was not opposed to legislation increasing FERC's deadline authority in this way, but did not necessarily see a need for it because, in his view, the commission had been moving quickly on pipeline certificate reviews."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Potential Effects of H.R. 161", "paragraphs": ["As stated above, H.R. 161 would make three major changes to FERC's pipeline certification process, all schedule-related.

These provisions are provided as examples in the Appendix .", "The optimal time for any deadline that Congress might impose on FERC is unclear. Compared to an 11.6-month benchmark implied by the GAO study, the 12-month deadline in H.R. 161 would be approximately the same as the average FERC certificate review time today. However, 12 months could represent a reduction in the review time that might be expected for atypically lengthy or complex pipeline projects, perhaps routed through heavily populated or environmentally sensitive areas. The safety or environmental reviews for such projects might place them in the \"tail\" of the review time distribution reported by GAO. For example, according to the GAO report, one pre-filed certificate review lasted 886 days. Assuming a 210-day pre-filing period for this project implies a certificate review time of 676 days, or 22.5 months. For such pipeline projects, it is unclear what FERC could do differently to shorten its review process if the bulk of the review involves a complex NEPA environmental evaluation. More information might be required to understand how FERC could adapt its process to meet a 12-month deadline for such projects and to gage the possible impact of this provision.", "If the 12-month deadline under H.R. 161 were imposed upon FERC, it raises the possibility that the commission might deny certificate applications for some projects solely on the grounds that it lacks sufficient time for an adequate (and legally defensible) review, especially in the case of NEPA compliance. This kind of denial is what occurred in 2012 when the State Department denied an application by TransCanada for a Presidential Permit to construct the Keystone XL oil pipeline, citing insufficient time under a 60-day deadline imposed by Congress under the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011 ( P.L. 112-78 ) to obtain all the necessary information to assess the project. When the 112 th Congress considered delegating permit authority for the Keystone XL Pipeline to FERC and mandating permit approval within 30 days under H.R. 3548 (see Appendix ), a senior FERC official testified that such a proposal would not provide enough time for an \"adequate\" public record, among other concerns. Another such permit review statute, the Mineral Leasing Act, includes a provision conditioning the deadline upon satisfying review requirements under NEPA and \"other applicable law\" within the given timeframe (30 U.S.C. 226(p)(2)(A)).", "In July 2013 testimony before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Commissioner Moeller stated that FERC could likely achieve the 12-month deadline proposed in H.R. 161 as long as gas pipeline certificate applications are complete when the process begins. Nonetheless, a 12-month deadline imposed upon all FERC certificate reviews may lead to the rejection or delay (due to re-application) of otherwise worthy proposals on administrative grounds if unanticipated issues arise. It might also force developers to reconfigure, or break up, larger projects into smaller proposals more \"reviewable\" within 12 months. The southern leg of the original Keystone XL pipeline project (now called the Gulf Coast Project) was separated this way and proceeded to construction under its own permit process. Reconfiguration of complex pipeline projects might lead to inefficiencies both in FERC certification and in the design or use of the infrastructure itself.

Note that this deadline occurs only after FERC's environmental review is completed, so other agencies would presumably have months during FERC's NEPA review to conduct reviews of approvals under their jurisdiction. Although it affirms FERC's current regulatory judgment as to how long the cooperating agency deadline should be, H.R. 161 may tie the hands of the commission if, at some future date, FERC concludes that 90 days is no longer appropriate. In that case, FERC would have to seek new legislation rather than changing the deadline under its existing EPAct authority through the regulatory process. Some might view this provision as being insurance against the commission becoming more lax in the future with respect to review deadlines. Others might view this provision as being too prescriptive.
