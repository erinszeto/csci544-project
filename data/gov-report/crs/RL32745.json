Ironically, not only did Pakistan develop its nuclear weaponscapability during the 1980s while receiving major U.S. economic and military assistance, butbecause it was partially hostage to Islamabad's own foreign policy objectives, the United Statesunwittingly facilitated the rise of a radical anti-U.S. Islamic terrorist movement. (3) The ranks of Al Qaeda andthe Taliban include some of the very same radical Islamists nurtured by Pakistan's Inter-ServicesIntelligence (ISI) organization and supported and armed by the CIA in the successful effort to drivethe Soviet Army out of Afghanistan. Some observers view this unwanted legacy as cause for notlosing sight of U.S. nuclear nonproliferation and other interests when seeking to forge closerantiterrorism ties to a country that has been a major and recent source of the proliferation of nucleartechnology and materials, and which also faces some degree of risk of itself falling under the controlof radical Islamists.

The New York Times reported onDecember 26, 2004, that both the Bush Administration and the United Nations' International AtomicEnergy Agency (IAEA) had gathered evidence in the Middle East and Asia indicating that Khan'snetwork may be much more extensive than previously assumed. The extent and degree of threatposed by Khan's network has become apparent through the discovery in Libya of plans for an atomicbomb and other elements of a \"nuclear starter kit,\" evidence that Pakistan has been the source ofmost of Iran's uranium enrichment know-how and technology, strong indications that Pakistan hasbeen the main source of centrifuges or components for North Korea's secret uranium enrichmentprogram.

According to U.S. officials, Karni andKhan had shipped these and other dual use items on the U.S. Export control list using a chain ofcompanies in New Jersey, South Africa, the U.A.E., and Pakistan. Karni engaged a New Jerseycompany, Giza Technologies, Inc., of Secaucus, New Jersey, as a front purchaser, and tookadvantage of the fact dual use items can be exported to South Africa without an export licensebecause South Africa is a member of the Nuclear Supplier Group. Because the triggered spark gapsare also used in a medical device (\"lithotripter\") that breaks up kidney stones, the shipment wasaddressed to a South African hospital when it left Giza Technologies. Karni's company, Top-CapeTechnology, of Cape Town was the actual recipient in South Africa. (41) ", "The fact that Karni a sold other sensitive dual use technology to two laboratories connectedwith India's space program that are on the U.S. Commerce Department Entities List -- organizationswhich are barred from receiving certain dual use exports -- suggests to some observers thatadditional countries, including Iran, also may have used the network. (42) Reportedly, of even moreconcern to U.S. officials, Humayun Khan was known to be close to the All Jammu and KashmirMuslim Conference (AJKMC), an organization that supports Pakistani militants fighting Indianforces in Kashmir. The freight forwarder's tracking number indicated that the package was pickedup in Islamabad by an employee of the AJKMC Lithography Aid Society, an organizationpurportedly connected to the Agha Khan Foundation, a charitable organization which maintains aworld-wide network of hospitals. (43) The real purposes of the AJKMC Lithography Aid Society maybe indicated by the fact that it apparently confused lithotripters with lithography, a printing process. Similarities in the Aid Society's stationary and address suggest it is just a cover address for HumayunKhan's Pakland PME. (44) ", "U.S. officials reportedly have said that because of the large numbers of high speed electricalswitches that had been sought, it seemed likely that they were destined for the Pakistani military andpossibly for other countries that were attempting to produce nuclear weapons. Reportedly, U.S.investigators and analysts have not been able to connect the government of Pakistan, which deniesany involvement in the illegal exports, directly to the transactions. (45) Reportedly, however,some U.S. officials have said in not-for-attribution interviews that the same figures in the Pakistani military who they suspect placed the orders for the triggered spark gaps and other sensitivetechnology via the Arni-Humayun Khan may also have worked with A.Q. Khan. (46) ", "Some observers suggest, however, that the real problem is not proving the connection, butrather the reluctance of the U.S. government to risk jeopardizing Pakistan's anti-terrorismcooperation by aggressively pursuing the case with Pakistan. In early January 2005, then-Secretaryof State Colin Powell told the press that U.S. officials \"have presented evidence to Pakistan's leadersof Pakistani involvement in the spread of nuclear weapons technology,\" but he gave no indicationof Pakistan's response, if any. (47) Reportedly, according to other unnamed U.S. officials, thereluctance of senior policymakers to pursue the case against Humayun Khan reflects \"a largertug-of-war between federal agencies that enforce U.S. nonproliferation laws and policy-makers whoconsider Pakistan too important to embarrass.\" (48) ", "As in the A.Q. Khan case, the reported handling of this case by U.S. policymakers appearsto suggest that American dependance on Pakistan for cooperation against terrorism has significantlyinfluenced U.S. nuclear nonproliferation policy. Two apparent aspects of U.S. policy concern, orare likely to concern, critics of the Administration's priorities. ", "First, the reported struggle between the State Department, on the one hand, and theCommerce Department and U.S. Customs service, on the other, over how aggressively the UnitedStates should pressure Pakistan for cooperation, creates a perception that nonproliferation policy haslower priority than antiterrorism cooperation with Islamabad. Reportedly, the State Departmentsuccessfully blocked a request by the Commerce Department and the Department of HomelandSecurity to send investigators to Pakistan. (49) By reportedly not making forceful efforts to gain access toHumayun Khan in Pakistan, the United States may be reducing its ability to determine if any of thetechnology procured by Asher Karni's Pakistani partner was transferred to other countries. U.S.investigators are said to be involved in a major effort to follow leads in South Africa, the U.A.E.,India, and elsewhere, and the Administration has made \"high-level\" requests for cooperation directlyto Musharraf, but some \"senior officials\" reportedly have complained in press interviews that theserequests have not been made \"forcefully or publicly.\" (50) In April 2005 a Washington, DC, federal grand jury indictedHumayun Khan, who remains at liberty in Pakistan, both for conspiracy to violate U.S. exportcontrol laws, and for violating U.S. laws on three occasions. A conviction on all charges could causeKhan to be sentenced to incarceration for a maximum of 35 years. (51) ", "Second, some Members of Congress and proliferation experts argue that it is a mistake toacknowledge even tacitly nuclear weapons state status of Pakistan and India, or to acquiesce incontinued pursuit of \"vertical proliferation\" by both countries through efforts to improve theirexisting nuclear weapons capability. In the context of the five-year NPT Review Conference thatopened at the United Nations in early May 2005, Joseph Cirincione, the head of the Nonproliferationproject of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, reportedly warned that allowing Indiaand Pakistan to expand their arsenals of nuclear weapons without international oversight or theimposition of sanctions will result in a proliferation \"chain reaction.\" (52) ", "Reported comments by U.S. officials in early 2005 indicate the reluctant acceptance by theAdministration that Pakistan will continue to seek upgrade its nuclear capability, including possiblefuture attempts to illegally export technology from the United States. While U.S. investigators andprosecutors are aggressively seeking to stop efforts by individuals and countries to obtain sensitivecontrolled U.S. technology, senior Administration officials reportedly say that the U.S. governmenthas little leverage over Pakistan. In May 2005, U.S. officials who insisted on anonymity reportedlyexplained to a journalist that the Administration believed its options for putting pressure onMusharraf were few, because Pakistani cooperation remained crucial in the war on terrorism. Oneofficial reportedly made a distinction between horizontal proliferation to would-be nuclear powersand terrorist, and Pakistan's efforts to enhance its existing nuclear capabilities. \"It's one thing forthem to cooperate with us to stop [nuclear components] from going elsewhere, such as Iran,\" theU.S. official reportedly said, \"but they will never cooperate with us on efforts to stop things that theyare trying to get.

However, even in that report, there is no mention of a connection between South Asia, Iran,Libya, or North Korea. In the sections on Iran and North Korea, there is no information on foreignsuppliers, and the section on Libya refers just to Libya seeking \"technical exchanges\" for dual-useequipment. A.Q.

Khan network and its role insupplying nuclear technology to Libya, Iran, and North Korea illustrate one form of this threat, butcommercial purveyors of dual-use technologies who routinely seek to circumvent internationalexport control regimes to deliver WMD-related equipment and material to WMD-aspirant countriesare of grave concern as well. (61)", "Transfers to Iran. By and large, the U.S.intelligence community appears not to have identified Pakistan as a significant source of nucleartechnology for Iran. Concerns about a potential Iranian nuclear weapons program date back to the1970s, with a hiatus during the years of the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1989). With the end of that war,the attention of the Iranian government turned back to recreating its nuclear program, including thereactors at Bushehr. When many governments were persuaded not to participate in the project,Russia stepped in to fill the gap, and U.S. attention focused on the nuclear technology Iran mightglean from Russian scientists and engineers. Although centrifuge enrichment techniques were aconcern, the intelligence community had not focused on Pakistan as a particular supplier. In theSection 721 reports, Russia and China are repeatedly mentioned as suppliers to Iran's nuclearprogram. From 1999 to 2001, the report admits that Iran has sought technology from a variety ofsources, but especially Russia. Only in the report for the first half of 2002 is there mention that theU.S. intelligence community suspects Iran is interested in acquiring foreign fissile material andtechnology for weapons development.", "Transfers to Libya. Although the U.S.intelligence community long had suspected Libyan interest in developing nuclear weapons, mostanalysts attributed the limited Libyan success to sanctions and lack of an indigenous scientific andengineering base. The IAEA reported in February 2004 that Libya began receiving centrifugecomponents from A.Q. Khan in 1997. Yet, the Section 721 reports did not contain any text abouta Libyan nuclear program until 2000. Then, the report noted that the suspension of U.N. sanctions\"has accelerated the pace of procurement efforts in Libya's drive to rejuvenate its ostensibly civiliannuclear program.\" That report hinted that a nuclear cooperation agreement with Moscow would playa key role. Not until the report for January to June 2002 did the text note that Libya used its secretservices \"to try to obtain technical information on the development of WMD, including nuclearweapons.\" If this was referring to Libya's procurement of a nuclear weapons design from A.Q. Khan,it seems to imply less willingness by Khan to provide the plans than apparently was the case.

Although a senior North Korean official reportedly admitted that it has anenrichment program to U.S. Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly during a confrontationalmeeting in Pyongyang in October 2002, Pyongyang has continued to publicly deny possessing sucha program.

(64) The CIAconcluded that North Korea began a centrifuge-based uranium enrichment program in 2000. Further,the paper noted that, in 2001, North Korea \"began seeking centrifuge-related materials in largequantities. It also obtained equipment suitable for use in uranium feed and withdrawal systems.\" The CIA, the report said, had \"learned that the North is constructing a plant that could produceenough weapons-grade uranium for two or more nuclear weapons per year when fully operational-- which could be as soon as mid-decade.\" (65) ", "One media report in 2002 cited Western officials as stating that Pakistan's aid included acomplete design package for a centrifuge rotor assembly; another stated that Pakistan had exportedactual centrifuge rotors (2,000-3,000).

In the first report in 1997, the text states that NorthKorea does not require significant outside assistance to produce WMD. In the 1998 report, there isno mention of any procurement related to the nuclear program, and the report for the first half of1999 states that \"Pyongyang sought to procure technology worldwide that could have applicationsin its nuclear program, but we do not know of any procurement directly linked to the nuclearweapons program.\" This statement was included in both reports for 2000, but dropped in reports for2001.

A close friend of Khan -- a person who may well have an interest in shiftingblame away from the famed metallurgist -- reportedly described Karamat (along with both Musharrafand Beg) as having been \"aware of everything\" Khan had done.

Reportedly Musharraf had decided, in the words of a senior ex-military officer, that \"It was time toput an end to this dirty business.\" Musharraf's main concern, the article argues, was to avoidjeopardizing his desire to get rid of remaining U.S. economic and military sanctions.

W.Bush that he could not make the required certification to Congress that Pakistan did not have nuclearweapons, thus invoking the \"Pressler Amendment,\" Sec. 620E(e) of the Foreign Assistance Act,1961, as amended, requiring a cutoff of military and economic assistance to Pakistan.

He insisted that the ultimate authority wasalways the \"Chief Executive\" -- in this case Benazir Bhutto. Bhutto herself claimed that Khan couldnot have been acting alone and that senior government or military officials were seeking to cover-uptheir own complicity. She even asserted that, as Prime Minister, she had turned down severalrequests by military officials and scientists to export Pakistan's nuclear technology.

One of the most problematical aspects of selling F-16s to Pakistan is that, in the words of one study,\"The F-16 could be Pakistan's primary nuclear-capable aircraft, capable of delivering a1,000-kilogram bomb to a distance of 1,400 kilometers.\" (157) A key question thatCongress may wish to consider is whether the United States is paying too high a price, including acost to its foreign policy interest in a stable and peaceful India-Pakistan relationship, for what it isgetting from Pakistan. (158) ", "Potentially Risky Test of Wills. A potentiallysignificant problem with this option is that so long as Islamabad perceives that the BushAdministration needs it more than Pakistan needs the United States, Musharraf or a successor is ina position to turn the tables on U.S. policymakers. That is, instead of treating the F-16s or otherweapons systems as a \"carrot,\" to be earned by additional cooperation, Pakistan could reduce or limitits cooperation on terrorism as a lever to get the United States to agree to allow the purchase of theaircraft and other desired hardware. In fact, some of President Musharraf's remarks at a pressconference during a visit to Washington in early December 2004 -- several months before theAdministration announced its willingness to approve the sale of the F-16s -- could be interpreted aseffort to put counter-pressure on the United States. Musharraf told reporters that he had discussedthe F-16 issue with President Bush and senior U.S. officials, but that the Administration had not yetagreed to the requested purchase. At the same time, Musharraf also implied declining enthusiasmfor using Pakistani forces to hunt for Al Qaeda in tribal zone between Pakistan and Afghanistan,where many believe bin Laden and other senior terrorist leaders may be hiding. He reportedlycriticized the U.S. invasion of Iraq and said that the trail of Osama bin Laden had gone cold, \"in largepart\" because of a decline in operations by U.S. forces in Afghanistan and delays in the training ofAfghan forces (159) ", "Although using the offer to sell F-16s to Pakistan as leverage to gain more cooperationregarding A.Q. Khan's network or other objectives could backfire, Musharraf's domestic politicalvulnerabilities noted above might give the United States the upper hand in any test of wills. Moreover, conditioning the sale of F-16s on better responsiveness by Pakistan to U.S. nuclearnonproliferation concerns may be the least risky of the options that involve putting pressure onPakistan, but the viability of this option depends on many factors that are outside U.S. control, andeven that of Musharraf. Because of his somewhat precarious domestic political system, any attemptto achieve a quid-pro-quo would appear to have the best prospects of success if done in secrecy. ", "F-16 Fighter Aircraft Sale and the India-PakistanConfrontation. On March 25, 2005, at a State Department press briefing, unnamedsenior officials announced that Pakistan would be allowed to buy an unspecified number of F-16s. The officials also announced that the prime contractors on both the F-16 and the F-18 fighters,General Dynamics and McDonnel Douglas respectively, would be allowed to bid on an expectedIndian contract for a new multi-role combat aircraft. The announcement followed a March 2005 tripto six Asian countries, starting with India and Pakistan, by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and,according to an unnamed State Department briefer, \"months of thinking through American Strategytowards South Asia.\"", "The briefer designated by the ground rules as \"senior official one\" placed the possible saleof combat aircraft to India in the context of \"a new framework of cooperation,\" which might alsoinclude the sale of ballistic missile defense technology and even cooperation on nuclear energy. Inresponse to questions from the press, the briefer denied that the sale of F-16s to Pakistan would bedestabilizing, arguing that while the numbers of aircraft provided to Pakistan would be relativelysmall, perhaps in the neighborhood of 25, the Indian government was contemplating a very largescale purchase. (160) ", "Whether the Administration's decision to approve the request might be the result of asuccessful strategy to gain more cooperation on A.Q. Khan's network and Al Qaeda cannot bedetermined from open sources. Should there be a link to Pakistan's new cooperation with the IAEA,some critics of the Administration's handling of Pakistan's nuclear activities may question the valueof the tradeoff. When a questioner at the March 25, 2005 press briefing commented that theannouncement came shortly after Pakistan announced that it would allow IAEA inspectors to lookat some \"nuclear parts\" (161) to aid its investigation of Iran's nuclear program, the StateDepartment briefer responded that \"We don't want to get into the details of our diplomaticdiscussions with Pakistan on this very sensitive issue.\" The briefer added, however, that \"What wecan say is that the A.Q. Khan issue has obviously been an issue the Secretary has been working onvery hard and she did discuss it during her trip with the Pakistani government and we feel like thePakistani government is offering good cooperation on this front to address the understandableconcerns we have.\" (162) ", "Congressional Role and Powers. Congress itselfhas the power under the Arms Export Control Act to block an arms sale by passing a joint resolutionor other legislation with a sufficient margin (i.e., two-thirds or more) to overcome a Presidentialveto. The fact that the Administration has announced its intent to resume sales of F-16s to Pakistandoes not affect Congress' powers. As of mid-May 2005, the Administration had not submitted arequired formal notification of the intent to sell the aircraft. Customarily the Defense Departmentnotifies Congress informally of its intent to carry out an arms sale, but because Pakistan wasdesignated a non-NATO ally in June 2004, Congress would have only 15 calendar days followingthe formal submission of a notification to block a sale. (163) ", "A refusal by Congress to allow the F-16 sale to go forward would have significant, butunpredictable and almost certainly negative impact on U.S.-Pakistan relations. Consequently, shouldMembers of Congress wish to block the sale or attach conditions with the least negativeconsequences for U.S.-Pakistan cooperation against terrorism, they may wish to seek abehind-the-scenes dialogue with the Administration, or otherwise make their views known prior tothe receipt by Congress of a formal notification of intent to sell the aircraft.
