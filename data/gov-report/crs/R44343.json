The program authorizes institutions of higher education (IHEs) to capitalize revolving loan funds for the purpose of making low-interest loa ns to students with exceptional financial need. The program is authorized under Title IV, Part E of the Higher Education Act (HEA). It supersedes Title II\u2014Loans to Students in Institutions of Higher Education\u2014of the National Defense Education Act of 1958 (P.L. 85-864), which was incorporated into the HEA through the Education Amendments of 1972 (P.L. 92-318). Previously, these loans were known as National Defense Student Loans and National Direct Student Loans.", "In general, Perkins Loans are available to undergraduate and graduate and professional students and must be made reasonably available to all eligible students, with priority given to students with exceptional financial need. Interest on Perkins Loans is fixed at a rate of 5% per year, and no interest accrues prior to a student beginning repayment, nor while repayment is suspended or in deferment. Individuals who have engaged in a variety of public service endeavors (e.g., teachers in low-income schools, law enforcement officers) are eligible to have part or all of their Perkins Loan cancelled. ", "Historically, IHEs capitalized their revolving Perkins Loan funds with a combination of federal capital contributions (FCCs) and matching institutional capital contributions (ICCs). The FCC was allocated according to statutorily prescribed procedures. The HEA authorized appropriations to enable the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to make new FCCs to institutional revolving loan funds through FY2014, and through FY2015 with an automatic one-year extension under the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA). In addition, a limited grandfathering provision authorized the appropriation of funds through FY2020, and through FY2021 under GEPA, for FCCs to IHEs' Perkins Loan funds for the purpose of making loans to continuing students who were prior Perkins Loan recipients. Although appropriations were last provided for this purpose in FY2004, IHEs continued to make new Perkins Loans to students from their revolving loan funds. In academic year 2013-2014, approximately 1,500 IHEs disbursed $1.2 billion in new Perkins Loans to approximately 539,000 students.", "Authorization of appropriations for the Secretary to allocate FCCs to participating IHEs and for IHEs to award new Perkins Loans to students expired on October 1, 2015. For approximately two and one-half months thereafter, the operation of the Perkins Loan program was curtailed and loans could only be made to continuing students. Then, on December 18, 2015, Congress enacted the Federal Perkins Loan Program Extension Act of 2015 (the Extension Act; P.L. 114-105 ). It extended the authorization of IHEs to make new Perkins Loans to eligible students through September 30, 2017, but prohibited additional appropriations beyond FY2015 for the purpose of making new Perkins Loans and prohibited an automatic extension of the program under GEPA. In addition, the Extension Act amended several key Perkins Loan program provisions relating to student eligibility to receive new Perkins Loans, institutional disclosures required to be made to students borrowing new Perkins Loans, and the distribution of Perkins Loan fund assets upon the program's conclusion.
