Previously, the major safeguards were: (1) USDA restrictions on imports of ruminants and their products from countries with BSE; (2) a ban on feeding most mammalian proteins to cattle and other ruminants, issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); and (3) a targeted domestic surveillance program by USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), the agency responsible for animal health monitoring and disease control.", "Some argued that these safeguards were inadequate, as evidenced by findings of BSE here and subsequent federal efforts to bolster protections. Most new actions announced by USDA on December 30, 2003, were under the purview of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), responsible for the safety of most U.S. meat and poultry. These actions took effect in January 2004 and included (1) holding tested carcasses until BSE-negative results are obtained; (2) banning nonambulatory (\"downer\") cattle from human food; and (3) banning certain additional animal parts from human food. USDA also increased work and spending on a national animal identification and tracking system, and undertook an enhanced BSE surveillance program, among other activities. On January 26, 2004, FDA announced planned changes to its safeguards, including additional bovine materials banned from the human foods and cosmetics it regulates; a ban on poultry litter, restaurant waste, and ruminant blood products from ruminant feed; and stricter oversight of feed manufacturing. In lieu of these changes, FDA on October 6, 2005, proposed a ban, in all types of animal feed, of some higher-risk cattle parts. A final rule is pending.", "Many Members of the 110th Congress continue to closely follow these BSE developments; hearings and legislative proposals on various aspects of the issue are possible. Among the policy questions have been whether expanded agency actions have provided further protections against BSE, whether they are scientifically sound, and what costs they may have imposed on consumers, taxpayers, and industry. Also at issue have been whether USDA and FDA have effectively implemented and enforced the current safeguards; whether these safeguards will be sufficient to rebuild foreign markets' confidence in the safety of U.S. beef; and whether other types of actions should be considered, among other questions. Additional U.S. BSE cases could affect these policy deliberations.", "This report will be updated if significant developments occur."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or \"mad cow disease\") is a fatal degenerative neurological disease of cattle. It is believed to be caused by an abnormal protein, called a prion. It is in the family of related diseases referred to as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, or TSEs. TSEs include scrapie in sheep and goats, chronic wasting disease (CWD) in deer and elk, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD, in humans. BSE is believed to be spread to cattle in feed, but not transmitted directly from one animal to another in a herd.", "Worldwide, BSE has been found in more than 187,000 animals in approximately two dozen countries. However, the majority of cases, approximately 183,000, have been in the United Kingdom (UK), where the disease was first detected in 1986. Most of the rest occurred elsewhere in Europe, although Japan and North America have reported multiple cases. The total number of annual cases has declined steeply since their peak in 1992 in the UK.", "BSE is thought to be transmissible to humans who eat contaminated beef, causing a variant form of CJD (variant or vCJD) that was first recognized in 1996 during the BSE outbreak in the UK. Almost 200 people have been diagnosed with vCJD since 1986, most of them in the UK. As of mid-May 2007, no persons had been reported to have contracted vCJD in the United States.", "As of mid-May 2007, BSE had been reported in 14 cattle in North America. One animal, found in Canada in 1993, had been imported from the UK. The rest were born in North America and were detected in 2003 or afterward. They include 10 native-born cases in Canada, one case in the United States (U.S.) which was born in Canada, and two native-born U.S. cases. Because the first Canadian case in 1993 is not relevant to an understanding of recent North American BSE risk or control measures, it is often excluded from official case counts. While both native-born U.S. cases were born prior to the institution of feed controls (the \"feed ban\") in 1997, at least six of the 11 Canadian-born animals (including the one discovered in the United States) were born after similar controls were implemented in Canada, also in 1997. This has raised concerns about the effectiveness of the feed ban in general, and the speed and thoroughness of its implementation, particularly in Canada. A list of North American BSE cases follows:", "Canada:", "December 1993 , Canada reported BSE in a cow imported from the UK in 1987, around the height of the outbreak there; May 20, 2003 , Canada announced the first native case, found in a Black Angus beef cow that was born in Saskatchewan in March 1997 and presented for slaughter in Alberta in January 2003; January 2, 2005 , Canada confirmed BSE in an Alberta dairy cow born in October 1996; January 11, 2005 , Canada confirmed BSE in an Alberta beef cow born in March 1998; January 22, 2006 , Canada confirmed BSE in an approximately six-year-old crossbred cow born and raised in Alberta; April 16, 2006 , Canada confirmed BSE in a six-year-old dairy cow in British Columbia; July 4, 2006 , Canada confirmed BSE in a crossbred beef cow of at least 15 years of age in Manitoba; July 13, 2006, Canada confirmed BSE in a 50-month-old dairy cow from Alberta; August 23, 2006 , Canada confirmed BSE in a \"mature\" (likely 8- to 10-year-old) crossbred beef cow from Alberta. February 7, 2007 , Canada confirmed BSE in a \"mature\" bull from Alberta. Preliminary investigation suggested that the animal was born in 2000.

This animal had been killed and tested in November 2004, when BSE was initially ruled out, but subsequent retesting of brain tissue in June 2005 confirmed BSE; March 13, 2006 , USDA confirmed the third (second native-born) U.S. BSE case, a nonambulatory, red crossbred cow in Alabama that was more than 10 years old."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Cases of BSE", "paragraphs": ["In the first U.S. case, USDA stated that virtually no risk to public health existed. However, the department announced a voluntary recall of thousands of pounds of beef that had entered the food supply as a precautionary measure (see box), and also conducted an extensive epidemiological investigation into how the cow likely contracted BSE and whether other animals also might have the disease. During this investigation, which was officially concluded on February 9, 2004, more than 700 cattle at 11 facilities were destroyed and 255 of those were tested for BSE, all with negative results. The 255 were deemed \"of interest\" because they could have been from the source herd in Alberta, Canada.", "In the second U.S. case, USDA said that no material from the animal entered the food or feed supply. The epidemiological investigation, completed in late August 2005, attempted to trace all adult animals that left the index farm (the Texas ranch) after 1990 and all progeny born within two years of the BSE cow's death. Sixty-seven animals still on the index farm were killed and tested, all negative for BSE. USDA determined that 200 animals of interest had left the farm, 143 of which were slaughtered. Only two others were found alive; one was not tested because its age ruled it out as a suspicious animal, and the other tested negative. Of the rest, 34 were presumed dead, one was known dead, and 20 were untraceable. USDA also was interested in two calves born to the BSE cow, but due to recordkeeping gaps, it had to trace a total of 213 calves to try to eliminate the calves of interest. None were found alive to test (most were fed and slaughtered for beef).", "Regarding the third U.S. case, in which no material entered the food or feed supply (the animal had been euthanized and buried on the farm), APHIS and Alabama State officials investigated 36 farms and five auction houses, and conducted DNA testing on herds that may have included relatives of the BSE case. However, they were unable to determine the cow's herd of origin or to find any related animals of interest, except for the two most recent calves of the infected animal. One calf was still on the farm of the infected cow and being held by APHIS for observation; the other had died the year before.", "Officials also conducted investigations into the source of the feed consumed by the infected animals, because feed containing infective ruminant material (i.e., meat and bone meal from rendered cattle) is considered the most likely source of BSE infection. Of concern to some scientists, however, was that several of the Canadian BSE cases were born after 1997, when both the United States and Canada instituted similar but separate bans on the use of most mammalian proteins in cattle feed. This led some to question the effectiveness of such a feed ban in general, and/or the effectiveness of its implementation in Canada. (Both native-born U.S. cases were born before 1997.)", "In June 2006, a USDA official reported that the two native-born U.S. cattle had \"atypical\" BSE, not the type seen in cattle in Europe or in the other North American cases. The implications of this finding, including whether atypical BSE could be spread by novel means, or whether existing controls are appropriate, are unclear at this time. The USDA official stated at the time that there were no plans to change existing controls, and the department was already in the process of ramping down its domestic BSE surveillance activity.", "The North American BSE cases prompted widespread debate over the effectiveness of U.S. (and Canadian) safeguards against BSE. These safeguards generally have been implemented incrementally over a number of years, not only as a response to its emergence in Great Britain and spread to other countries, but also to evolving scientific evidence about this relatively new disease, its causes, and means of transmission. Many animal health experts inside and outside of government assert that these regulatory developments have not constituted a \"piecemeal\" approach to addressing the BSE threat but rather an increasingly unified system of overlapping and complementary safeguards.", "Some critics, nonetheless, have questioned whether these safeguards are providing adequate protection against BSE. Also at issue have been whether their costs to taxpayers and industry are justified; whether such steps are defensible scientifically and will fully restore foreign markets' confidence in the safety of U.S. cattle and beef; and whether other types of regulatory and/or legislative actions should be considered, among other questions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Safeguards in Place Prior to December 2003", "paragraphs": ["In the wake of the far more extensive BSE outbreaks in the United Kingdom and other countries starting in 1986, U.S. officials had, by the late 1980s, begun erecting what they and beef industry leaders had termed the \"three firewalls\" to keep the disease out of the United States and to contain it immediately if it should occur here:", "Restrictions on imports of ruminants and their products from countries with BSE; A ban on feeding most mammalian proteins to cattle and other ruminants; and A targeted domestic surveillance program.", "A number of critics argued that this system was inadequate. Government officials acknowledged that the system was not fail-safe, but asserted that it was scientifically defensible and kept the risks of BSE\u2014to both U.S. agriculture and human health\u2014at extremely minimal levels. Among other evidence, they cited reviews they commissioned by the Harvard School of Public Health's Center for Risk Analysis (the \"Harvard study\") concluding that the safeguards were sound and would reinforce each other in preventing the spread of isolated BSE cases, should they arise. It should be noted that the Harvard study was a mathematical model that used assumptions based on existing evidence whenever possible.

These additional actions, the Secretary of Agriculture stated, had been under consideration for some time prior to confirmation of the U.S. BSE case. They are discussed at greater length later in this CRS report. The new actions included:", "Holding carcasses of tested animals until BSE-negative results are obtained (notice, January 12, 2004, Federal Register ); Banning nonambulatory (\"downer\") cattle from entering facilities that slaughter them for human food (interim final rule, January 12, 2004, Federal Register ); Keeping additional animal parts considered to be at higher risk\u2014such as central nervous system and several other tissues of older animals\u2014from the human food supply (interim final rule, January 12, 2004, Federal Register ); Prohibiting certain meat plant practices such as air injection stunning and some types of mechanical deboning operations (interim final rule, January 12, 2004, Federal Register ); Working on a national system to identify and track individual animals from their place of birth to slaughter; and Naming an international scientific panel to review the government's BSE response and recommend any needed improvements (the panel's findings are discussed below).", "On January 26, 2004, FDA announced it would publish changes to its own BSE safeguards, such as banning a number of bovine materials from the human foods and cosmetics it regulates; banning poultry litter, restaurant plate waste, and ruminant blood products from ruminant feed; and tightening feed manufacturing procedures and oversight. However, in the July 14, 2004 Federal Register , FDA published, jointly with USDA, a somewhat different approach, in an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) asking for public input \"on additional measures under consideration to help prevent the spread of BSE.\" Significantly, the FDA stated that it \"has reached a preliminary conclusion that it should propose to remove Specified Risk Material (SRM) from all animal feed and is currently working on a proposal to accomplish this goal.\"", "On October 6, 2005, FDA published its long awaited proposed rule to tighten feed restrictions, by banning, from all animal feeds, some higher-risk cattle parts (i.e., some SRM). A final rule had not been issued as of mid-May 2007. Some have criticized FDA over both the pace and adequacy of these proposed changes.

Although the panel observed that many of the government actions taken so far had been effective and conformed to international standards, it nonetheless recommended additional steps. These included further tightening animal feeding rules by FDA, and more extensive testing of cattle, to gain a better understanding of the prevalence of any BSE here.", "Some BSE experts and consumer groups welcomed findings from the report. Others in the beef, feed, and related industries responded that the IRT had exaggerated the risks based on faulty assumptions, and had not properly distinguished between the BSE situation in North America and the far more extensive problems experienced in Europe.

The United Kingdom (UK), where BSE was first reported, has experienced some 183,000 of the approximately 187,000 cases worldwide, and most of the rest have been found elsewhere in Europe. Annual BSE cases peaked in the UK in 1992 at more than 37,000, and have been declining there since then.", "As the UK was coping with a then-rising number of BSE discoveries, USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), the lead agency for controlling animal diseases, began to impose a series of import restrictions here. During 1989, APHIS first began to ban (by not issuing import permits) the importation of live ruminants (i.e., cattle, sheep, goats, deer, elk, buffalo) and most ruminant products from the UK and other countries where BSE has been diagnosed. On December 6, 1991, APHIS published formal rules banning the importation of ruminants, ruminant meats and related products from BSE countries (these rules essentially superseded the policy of not issuing import permits).", "On December 12, 1997, as BSE cases were emerging in other parts of Europe, APHIS instituted a ban on importing ruminants and most ruminant products from all of Europe. On December 7, 2000, USDA began to prohibit imports of all rendered animal protein products, regardless of species, from Europe out of concern that feed of nonruminant origin was potentially cross-contaminated with the BSE agent.

As for other animal diseases, the OIE standards for BSE are considered to be scientifically-based guidelines and recommendations, not hard and fast rules for trade. Veterinary authorities in individual countries are free to interpret and implement these guidelines to help prevent the introduction of foreign diseases into their domestic herds and flocks.", "The OIE-recommended trade conditions for such countries become increasingly restrictive as a country's BSE risk status increases. Under the OIE code, trade in some ruminant products, even from a highest-risk country, theoretically could occur so long as the exporting country followed the recommended safeguards. (Until 2005, the OIE Code described five BSE risk categories for exporting countries, ranging from BSE free to high BSE risk; there are now three categories. See below). In practice, however, most countries (including, until August 2003, the United States) were banning most ruminant products from any country that reported even a single case of BSE. Many still do.", "In August 2003, the United States had announced that it, Canada, and Mexico were entering into discussions at the OIE to develop new guidance for resuming trade with countries that have reported BSE, under certain conditions. The basis for the proposal, according to U.S. officials, was that conditions for trade should be based not simply on the number of \"mad cow\" cases a country has reported. Rather, trade conditions should better reflect the adequacy of a country's safeguards in addressing whatever level of risk is found through a scientifically valid risk assessment. In other words, countries with strong safeguards should not be penalized because rigorous testing has found an acceptably low number of BSE cases, whereas another exporting country with inadequate protections may simply not be testing for and/or reporting the disease. On May 26, 2005, the OIE agreed to new BSE trade guidelines. Included is a simplified hierarchy of risk:", "Category 1 countries are those with negligible risk, and thus subject to the least restrictive conditions for exporting ruminants and ruminant products; Category 2 are those countries with controlled risk; and Category 3 are those where the risks are unknown.", "In another guideline change, OIE decided that trade in boneless muscle beef from cattle under 30 months of age should be considered to be safe, regardless of their exporting country's BSE risk profile, so long as that country has appropriate controls in place. For example, one control would be an acceptable method for determining these animals' ages and for segregating them from older animals.", "APHIS announced in March 2007 that the OIE Scientific Commission had approved the U.S. request to be classified as a Category 2 \"controlled risk\" country. The recommendation and the same risk designation for Canada were to go to the OIE General Assembly for final approval in late May 2007. Again, as under the prior OIE guidelines for BSE, the newly modified guidelines leave it up to the exporting countries to convince importing country authorities that their beef and cattle are safe. The importing country, in turn, might or might not accept these demonstrations of safety\u2014and might not necessarily agree to observe the OIE guidelines. U.S. officials have stressed on several occasions that they expect other countries to recognize the OIE designation in opening their markets to more types of U.S. beef.

However, a dispute resolution process (such as under the Uruguay Round agreements administered by the World Trade Organization) can be lengthy and not always settled to the satisfaction of either party.", "The U.S.-supported approach to BSE and trade has been put to the test by practical developments between the United States and its trading partners. More specifically, Canada has been gaining continued expansion of its permitted ruminant exports to the United States. Although the Administration and many in Congress agree with Canada, several U.S. producer groups and their allies do not (see \" Canadian Beef and Cattle Imports ,\" below). At the same time, the United States has been trying to rebuild foreign confidence in its own beef supply, and to convince other countries that U.S. safeguards are scientifically sound, equaling or exceeding the internationally-recognized standards (also see \" Japan and Korea Beef Trade Issues ,\" later in this section)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Canadian Beef and Cattle Imports", "paragraphs": ["When Canada announced its first indigenous case of BSE on May 20, 2003, the United States immediately banned imports of live ruminants, including live cattle, and ruminant products, including beef and veal, from Canada.

The judge cited concerns about the safety of animal and human health, and said that USDA had not followed appropriate rulemaking procedures. USDA subsequently reached a May 5, 2004 agreement with plaintiffs that it would no longer allow products beyond those listed in August 2003 (see above). Any additional Canadian products (including bone-in beef or live cattle) would not be permitted until after issuance of the final rule that was first proposed on November 4, 2003, USDA promised.", "The final version of the November 4, 2003, proposal was then published in the January 4, 2005, Federal Register , to take effect March 7, 2005. Specifically, the rule creates a new category of \"minimal risk\" BSE regions\u2014those in which BSE-infected animals have been diagnosed, but where sufficient regulatory measures have been in place to ensure that the introduction of BSE into the United States is unlikely. The rule further classifies Canada in this category. The U.S. cattle group (R-CALF USA) again sued. The same federal judge on March 2, 2005, issued a preliminary injunction halting implementation of the final rule. The judge stated in part that R-CALF had \"demonstrated the numerous procedural and substantive shortcomings of the USDA's decision to allow importation of Canadian cattle and beef.

In its opinion, the three-judge appeals panel rejected each of the major grounds for the district court's findings. Among the appeals court's conclusions were that \"... based on the low incidence of BSE in the Canadian herd, the numerous safeguards against BSE in this country, the lack of any Canadian cattle under 30 months of age found with BSE, and the lack of any case of vCJD attributable to Canadian beef, any increased risk to human and animal health created by the Final Rule is negligible.\"", "July 18, 2005, became the first day that live cattle began to cross the border from Canada since May 2003.

Approximately 1 million head were imported through all of calendar year 2006.", "Restarting U.S.-Canadian beef and cattle trade has not been error-free. For example, in early August 2005, a U.S. packer recalled more than 1,800 pounds of beef after authorities discovered that a 31-month-old Canadian heifer had been imported and processed into meat. The animal, which was one month older than the 30-month cutoff in the rule, had been certified as part of a 35-head shipment by veterinarians accredited by Canadian food safety authorities. USDA officials also found that more than a dozen of the Canadian cattle during the first month of imports were pregnant, also in violation of the rule. The incidents fueled criticism among some opponents that the border reopening was premature.", "Despite such mistakes, and despite recent findings that a number of the Canadian cattle with BSE were born after that country instituted its cattle feeding restrictions in 1997, the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture and others have generally expressed confidence in the safety of Canadian beef and cattle.

However, the department reportedly withdrew the proposed rule from OMB to await more information from Canada about a BSE case announced earlier in July in an approximately four-year-old cow. Some critics outside of the department had asserted that because the cow was born long after the Canadian feed ban was instituted, the effectiveness of the ban and its enforcement should be scrutinized more closely before further relaxing import restrictions.", "On January 4, 2007, APHIS announced the proposed rule to permit older cattle from Canada.

Fueling their concern were Canada's announcements on February 7, 2007, of BSE in a \"mature bull\" in Alberta, and on May 2, 2007, of BSE in a likely 66-month-old dairy cow from British Columbia. Some critics cited the cases as more evidence that Canada had not yet effectively implemented its BSE safeguards.

USDA's current SRM list is somewhat different and generally covers only cattle over 30 months of age.", "The announcement had stated that the two countries would evaluate this interim system by July 2005 and modify it if appropriate. However, Japan, which reported 28 cases of BSE in its own cattle herd through mid-September 2006, moved much more slowly to open its market than U.S. interests had hoped for, not accepting any U.S. beef until December 2005. Then, on January 20, 2006, the Japanese again halted all U.S. beef imports after finding vertebral column bones (a prohibited material) in several boxes of veal shipped by a New York processor. Despite U.S. apologies and promises of stronger oversight measures, Japan did not reopen its market again until July 27, 2006. Japanese safety inspections of U.S.-certified beef plants were among a number of new concessions made by the United States.", "Despite these concessions, the Japanese market has remained difficult to rebuild for a number of reasons. For example, Japan has continued to inspect 100% of the boxes of U.S. beef shipments. Announcing another possible step forward, Agriculture Secretary Johanns said in April 2007 that the Japanese had promised to ease the 100% testing after conducting another series of audits of U.S. processing plants. He also reminded the Japanese and other countries that he expected them to observe OIE's anticipated recognition of the United States as a \"controlled risk\" country. That presumably means Japan should begin accepting beef from animals from under 30 months of age, not just under 21 months old. Meanwhile, Japanese consumers were substituting other proteins and other beef sources (notably, Australia and New Zealand) for U.S. beef, which had once accounted for 25% to 30% of beef consumed in Japan.", "U.S. rules to permit the importation of Japanese beef are already in place. USDA published, in the December 14, 2005, Federal Register , a rule to permit the importation of whole cuts of boneless beef from Japan, under specified conditions. USDA said the rule was in accord with OIE guidelines and was based on a risk analysis indicating that such cuts could be safely imported. Prior to imposition of a U.S. ban on Japanese beef imports due to animal disease (including BSE) outbreaks there, Japan exported an annual average of less than 9 tons of primarily specialty beef (Kobe and other Wagyu), according to department data. Some in Congress had expressed frustration that the United States appeared to be favoring Japanese beef producers at a time when authorities in Japan, where the BSE problem has been more pronounced, were blocking U.S. imports.", "The United States has encountered even more difficulty in regaining the South Korean market, once the second-largest U.S. beef buyer. Although Korea ostensibly lifted its ban on certain U.S. beef products on September 11, 2006, extremely strict import inspection requirements and procedures have continued to effectively block most of them. The South Koreans were rejecting U.S. beef first because they found bone fragments, albeit very small ones that are typically acceptable in commercial trade, in boneless beef (bone-in has not yet been made eligible), and, later, for what they claimed were unacceptable levels of dioxin.

According to APHIS officials, this permit system handled approximately 400 permit requests annually. The procedures that APHIS had developed for handling permit requests for small amounts of product were not adequate to deal with the high volume of requests for large quantities of commercial use beef. The agency did not implement or finalize standard operating procedures for processing the large volume of permits. For example, APHIS did not establish controls to ensure that risk mitigation measures were consistently applied.

The cause of the first cases of BSE is unknown; theories include spontaneous emergence of a single case, or the anomalous transmission of the sheep scrapie agent to cattle. It is thought that the long incubation period and possibly changes in rendering and feeding practices led to amplification of the agent in the feed supply and spread of the disease for years before it was recognized in 1986.", "In 1988, the UK banned the practice of feeding ruminant by-products back to ruminants. When the purported causal link between BSE and the human disease, variant Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (vCJD), was announced by the UK in 1996, the United States added similar controls over cattle feed, to prevent spread of the disease should it emerge. The FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM), responsible for the safety of animal feeds, began prohibiting the use of most mammalian protein in feeds for ruminants in August 1997, a restriction commonly called the \"feed ban.\" FDA registers and inspects renderers, feed mills, pet food manufacturers, animal feed distributors and others to ensure compliance.", "In a 2002 report on the feed ban, the GAO noted that, relative to other countries, U.S. surveillance and import controls were stronger, but the feed ban was more permissive. The Harvard study concluded that the feed ban was the dominant protective firewall, and would protect against spread of BSE even if the other firewalls failed. Conversely, the study also showed that failure of the feed ban led to the greatest increase in number of BSE cases. Many also noted that certain continuing, permissible practices may nonetheless result in the feeding of rendered ruminant materials to cattle. One such potential breach is the feeding of rendered cattle to poultry and the subsequent incorporation of poultry waste (called \"litter\"), which may contain spilled feed, into livestock feeds.", "Though in 2002 GAO limited its recommendations to improved enforcement of the existing feed ban, others suggested that the regulation itself be changed to enhance protection. The Harvard study found that if BSE were present in the United States, the greatest source of potential feed contamination would be from cattle that died on the farm and were rendered. By-products from these animals could legally be fed to non-ruminants, and the Harvard study found that if one such rendered cow were BSE-positive, the resulting release of infectivity into the feed supply could lead to new bovine cases from a single subsequent breach in the feed ban.", "Many, including the GAO and the Harvard study, have noted that there are opportunities for noncompliance at many points in the feed chain, and that some may be difficult to detect, such as intermittent commingling of feeds on farms that feed cattle along with poultry and other livestock. Some experts argued that if high-risk materials were prohibited in all animal feeds, that cross-contamination, breaches at feeding, and the concurrent regulatory oversight of these activities would become irrelevant.

It based the 90% claim on a report by a European Union scientific panel which found that approximately 64% of the infectivity in an animal with BSE is in the brain, and 26% is in the spinal cord. Each of the remaining SRMs covered by the USDA-FSIS human food ban contain much smaller percentages of total infectivity, FDA said.", "Even though the existing feed rule provides \"strong control measures\" and compliance \"is high by renderers, protein blenders and feed mills,\" FDA acknowledged that concerns about cross-contamination remain:", "For example, without fully dedicated equipment, it may not be possible to verify that there is zero carryover of feed or feed ingredients in equipment, even where a firm's cleanout procedures have been judged to be adequate. In addition, resource constraints limit FDA's ability to assure full compliance by all segments of the industry that are subject to the current BSE feed regulation. For example, resources are not available to the FDA and its state counterparts to fully verify compliance on over 1 million farms where cattle are being fed.", "The agency also noted concerns not only about unintentional but also intentional misfeeding of non-ruminant feed to ruminants on the farm. Financial incentives may exist to do so whenever inexpensive sources of prohibited protein are locally available, FDA concluded, adding that it believes the proposed rule would protect cattle by removing the highest risk materials even from non-ruminant feed.", "In its accompanying economic analysis, FDA stated that it had considered the following options: requiring the use of dedicated facilities or equipment to keep ruminant feed separate from non-ruminant feed; bans on poultry litter, blood products and/or plate waste in ruminant feeds; and a larger list of SRM to be prohibited in all feeds. It generally concluded that such additional measures are not necessary because the partial SRM ban being proposed would remove an estimated 90% of BSE infectivity.

This figure includes the cost of the test itself ($12 to $15) plus the cost of labor ($3 to $5), but not the investment needed to establish a testing facility at a plant.", "An APHIS spokesperson said in 2004 that, considering overhead costs, tests could run from $25 to $50 per animal. However, the USDA's enhanced surveillance program involved a variety of activities beyond the conduct of tests, including outreach to farmers and renderers (to identify all animals that should be tested), transportation of carcasses to sites where sample collection (including removal of the head) can be performed, sample transport and storage (including refrigeration), record-keeping, and the costs of investigating inconclusive and positive results, including indemnity payments. As a result, per-head cost comparisons can be difficult unless one knows the precise scope of activities that have been included, and whether the activities are limited to testing or encompass the broader requirements of a comprehensive surveillance program.", "To fund the enhanced surveillance program, USDA in March 2004 transferred an initial $70 million from its Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). By the time enhanced surveillance had ended, a total of $152.4 million in CCC funds had been used for the program. This amount was in addition to allocations for BSE surveillance coming out of annual congressional appropriations, which rose from $2 million in FY2001 to $17 million annually in each of FY2005-FY2007 (projected; this is an expected cost of testing 40,000 animals per year). Responding to questions at an April 2006 briefing on the program, the APHIS administrator estimated that the weekly cost of testing between 5,000 and 7,000 animals was approximately $1 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congressional Role", "paragraphs": ["The 108 th and 109 th Congresses closely followed the enhanced BSE surveillance effort as it was getting under way in 2004, when concerns were raised about its basic design and initial operation.

There was renewed congressional interest in testing when USDA, at OIG's insistence, in June 2005 retested tissues from a cow which initially had been declared negative for BSE, but was later confirmed to be positive (see above).", "The 109 th Congress did not hold hearings or introduce many bills on these issues, although a section of S. 2002 did propose a relatively extensive prion disease surveillance program that would have included compensation to industry for animals tested, and called for a task force on prion diseases to provide recommendations to Congress on all surveillance and research programs.", "Questions about surveillance and testing also have arisen during lawmakers' consideration of annual funding for APHIS. In the 109 th Congress, during House floor consideration of the pending FY2007 USDA appropriation bill ( H.R. 5384 ), Representative Kucinich offered but later withdrew an amendment aimed at maintaining BSE testing at the enhanced surveillance level. During its markup on May 9, 2006, the House Appropriations Committee defeated, on a voice vote, an amendment by Representative Tiahrt that would have barred USDA from enforcing its restriction on the private testing of cattle for BSE.

Therefore, all food safety measures announced by USDA to control BSE apply to state meat inspection facilities as well as federal facilities.", "FSIS earlier had been considering a number of policy options for protecting the human food supply from possible contamination by BSE agents. These measures were summarized in a January 15, 2002, \"current thinking\" paper. A number of these possible options related to designating various types of cattle parts as \"Specified Risk Materials\" (SRM, thereby making them unfit for human consumption), or to restricting the use of certain mechanical systems for recovering meat from vertebral columns (notably so-called advance meat recovery systems, or AMR). The agency announced a number of steps to ensure the safety and proper labeling of AMR products, but major new regulatory actions did not come until after the discovery of the first U.S. BSE cow.", "The Secretary of Agriculture announced these new preventive measures on December 30, 2003. The \"three firewalls\" had been in place, but they primarily were intended to prevent the emergence of BSE or its spread in cattle. Most of these newer FSIS measures involve changes in meat inspection and human food safety protections, interventions that had been regarded by USDA and FSIS to be unnecessary before BSE was known to be present in the United States.

USDA/FSIS took this regulatory action as part of the series of rule changes it announced on December 30, 2003. This action was published on January 12, 2004, as an interim final rule. Under the rule, meat inspectors must condemn all nonambulatory cattle presented for inspection for human food, regardless of the reason for their condition. \"Downers\" are defined as non-ambulatory or disabled animals that are unable to rise from a recumbent position (i.e., to stand) or are unable to walk. The action was based on the concern that animals could become non-ambulatory as a result of BSE.", "Proponents of this ban have argued that downer animals pose numerous food safety hazards, not limited to BSE but including microbial hazards such as Salmonella; they have noted that some prominent fast-food chains already ban the use of these animals for the meat they accept. Opponents of the ban have expressed concern about the integrity of BSE surveillance if these animals are no longer brought to slaughter, and have questioned the scientific basis of the ban, in light of its economic impacts. (As noted earlier, USDA says it has taken steps to ensure that many downed animals can continue to be tested, even if they are diverted from slaughter for human food.)", "USDA estimated that up to 200,000 \"downer\" cattle were slaughtered in the United States annually, and accounted for less than 1% of roughly 35 million animals slaughtered. Within this total, 25% or perhaps higher were ultimately condemned by meat inspectors as unfit for human consumption. USDA's statistical agency then collected two years of on-farm national data; it estimates there were approximately 465,000 nonambulatory cattle and calves at U.S. beef and dairy operations in 2003, and 450,000 in 2004.", "Some within the cattle industry have argued that the downer ban should distinguish between animals that cannot walk because of BSE or another potentially dangerous disease, and those that are simply lame (and, presumably, safe for use as food). Opponents have argued that a cow might have become lame because it was suffering from a nervous condition like BSE, and that making an accurate diagnosis would be difficult under the conditions which exist at slaughter.", "Nonambulatory disabled cattle generally can be separated into those that display central nervous system (CNS) disorders (of which BSE is one of several possible types) and those that do not but simply appear to be lame, USDA has observed. However, the department concluded, no data are available to determine the level of disease infectivity among non-ambulatory disabled cattle without CNS symptoms. So, officials decided it would be prudent to prohibit all \"downers\" from the food supply.", "Prior to the emergence of the North American BSE cases, downer cattle were linked with the issue of humane slaughter. Widespread media reports in the 1990s made claims that nonambulatory cattle were suffering in transport to and after arrival at slaughter plants.

(AMR, as distinct from mechanically-separated meat, uses pressure to remove edible tissues from bone without crushing it. The resulting product can be labeled \"meat,\" and is typically incorporated into products such as hot dogs and sausages.) USDA published in the January 12, 2004, Federal Register three interim final rules and one notice to codify these actions, effective immediately.", "One of these rules redefines so-called \"Specified Risk Materials,\" (SRM), those parts of a carcass where prions are believed to concentrate, and that are deemed inedible and cannot be inspected and passed as human food. The rule designates as SRM, among other tissues, brain and spinal cord in cattle older than 30 months, but continues to permit such materials from younger animals (under 30 months) to be inspected and passed as human food.", "Another of the rules prohibits the inclusion of certain parts in AMR meat. USDA has prohibited central nervous system tissue (brain, spinal cord and some other nerve tissues) from AMR meat in the past based on quality standards, not for food safety, but has found in tests of AMR meat that about one-third of it did contain prohibited material. The GAO has asserted that, irrespective of USDA's determinations of the safety of AMR meat, the public should be able to identify foods that may contain nervous system tissue. GAO recommended that USDA continue evaluating the safety of AMR meat, improve enforcement to keep prohibited nervous system tissue out, and consider labeling and other education efforts to advise consumers when they purchase products that may contain this tissue.", "The USDA expert panel (IRT) had commented on February 4, 2004, that until a more aggressive BSE surveillance was in place, the SRM definition for parts excluded from food should be expanded, to exclude high-risk tissues from any animal older than 12 months of age (as they had also recommended for the feed ban). However, the report also included a seemingly contradictory statement that until a better understanding of BSE prevalence were established, the 30 month cut-off was \"a reasonable temporary compromise.\" The full advisory committee reported that the USDA action to ban SRM from animals over 30 months removed the highest-risk tissues from the food supply and was in accordance with international standards. The Harvard risk assessment concluded that SRM removal would reduce potential human exposure by 95%.", "FDA published in the July 14, 2004, Federal Register , an interim final rule to prohibit, in the food, drugs, and cosmetics that it regulates, the same materials (i.e., SRM) banned in FSIS-regulated products. In the same issue, FDA and FSIS issued a joint advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) seeking public comments on additional measures under consideration to mitigate BSE risks. Among the questions specific to FSIS authorities were the following:", "What data or scientific information is available to evaluate an IRT recommendation that the entire intestine from cattle of all ages be removed, not only the distal ileum as currently required, to prevent potentially infective material from entering the human and animal food chains? What measures are needed to prevent cross contamination between cattle carcasses? In establishments that mainly slaughter cattle 30 months of age and older, are additional sanitation requirements necessary to prevent edible portions of carcasses from being contaminated with SRM? With regard to determining the equivalence of imports, should FSIS exempt countries with low or no BSE risk from its SRM rule, and if so, under what conditions?", "FSIS and FDA each published an interim rule in the September 7, 2005, Federal Register altering their separate rules on SRM in meat products, foods and cosmetics. Both agencies had earlier designated the distal ileum of all cattle, regardless of age, as SRM, but required companies to remove the entire small intestine, even though the distal ileum was the only portion where BSE infectivity has been confirmed. The September 7 interim rules permit companies, beginning on October 7, 2005, to remove the distal ileum (defined to be at least 80 inches) and to utilize the rest of the small intestine in food or cosmetics.
