The requirement for medical child support is apart of all child support orders(administered by CSE agencies), and it only pertains to the parent's dependent children. Activitiesundertaken by CSE agencies to establish and enforce medical child support are eligible for federalreimbursement at the CSE matching rate of 66%.", "The medical child support process requires that a state CSE agency notify the employer of a noncustodial parent who owes child support, that the parent is obligated to provide health carecoverage for his or her dependent children. CSE agencies notify employers of a medical childsupport order via a standardized federal form called the National Medical Support Notice. The planadministrator must then determine whether family health care coverage is available for which thedependent children may be eligible. If eligible, the plan administrator is required to enroll thedependent child in an appropriate plan, and notify the noncustodial parent's employer of thepremium amount to be withheld from the employee's paycheck.", "Although establishment of a medical support order is a prerequisite to enforcing the order, inclusion of a health insurance order does not necessarily mean that health insurance coverage isactually provided. According to CSE program data, in 2001, only 49% of child support ordersincluded health insurance coverage, and the health insurance order was complied with in only 18%of the cases. Most policymakers agree that health care coverage for dependent children must beavailable, accessible, affordable, and stable. Since 1977 and sporadically through 1998, Congresshas passed legislation to help states effectively establish and enforce medical child support. TheNational Medical Support Notice, mandated by 1998 law and promulgated in March 2001, wasviewed as a means to significantly improve enforcement of medical child support -- to date onlyabout half the states are using the Notice. The 1998 law also called for an advisory body to designa medical child support incentive which would become part of the CSE performance-based incentivepayment system -- a recommendation was made to Congress in 2001 to indefinitely delaydevelopment of a medical child support incentive mainly because it was argued that the appropriatedata was not yet available upon which to base such an incentive.", "Improving the establishment and enforcement of medical child support has been hampered to some extent by factors such as high health care costs, a decline in employer-provided healthinsurance coverage, an increase in the share of health insurance costs borne by employees, and thelarge number of uninsured children.

From a public health perspective, early and frequentmonitoring of children's health is a key component to ensuring the appropriate growth and healthydevelopment of children. From a family perspective, health insurance coverage greatly reducesparental financial and emotional stress. Medical child support benefits families by increasing theincidence of noncustodial parents who obtain private health insurance coverage for their dependentchildren. With medical child support, Congress found a way to make noncustodial parentsresponsible for their children and lessen taxpayer burden by shifting costs from the taxpayers backto the noncustodial parents.", "Since 1977, Congress has tried to offset some of the costs associated with the Medicaid program by allowing states to require Medicaid recipients to assign their child support rights to thestate and allowing the state to pursue reimbursement of the cost of Medicaid benefits provided to thechild from the child's noncustodial parent (in 1984 mandatory assignment became law). Since 1984,Congress has tried to increase provision of private health care coverage for children whosenoncustodial parent has access to employer-related or group health insurance that is provided at areasonable cost.

A 1993 amendment to the EmployeeRetirement Income Security Act (ERISA) required employer-sponsored group health plans to extendhealth care coverage to the children of a parent/employee who is divorced, separated, or nevermarried when ordered to do so by the state CSE agency via a Qualified Medical Child Support Order(QMCSO). The 1996 welfare reform law further strengthened medical support by stipulating thatall orders enforced by the state CSE agency must include a provision for health care coverage. (1) The1996 law also directed the CSE agency to notify the noncustodial parent's employer of theemployee's medical child support obligation. To help obtain health care coverage for children, a1998 law authorized the creation of the National Medical Support Notice (NMSN), a standardizedform, that is the exclusive document which must be used by all state CSE agencies.

Moreover, cash support and medical support are not alwayscompatible. For example, if premiums, co-payments, and deductibles of noncustodial parents rise,fairness might suggest that the cash child support payment of noncustodial parents be reduced toreflect payment of additional medical costs. The result, however, would be that custodial parentswould have less income to provide for the basic food, clothing, and shelter needs of their dependentchildren; conversely, if medical support is not available, the family will undoubtedly face direeconomic circumstances if a child becomes seriously ill.", "The public and policymakers generally agree that establishment and enforcement of medical support, where it is available on reasonable terms, promotes family responsibility, improveschildren's access to health care, and usually saves federal and state dollars.

The medical child support provisions benefit families byincreasing the incidence of noncustodial parents who obtain health insurance coverage for theirdependent children.

Otherwise, the amount collected as medical support is forwarded to the family.

Under this paradigm, ifonly the custodial parent has coverage, that coverage should be ordered and the noncustodial parentshould contribute toward the cost of such coverage. When both parents are potentially able toprovide coverage, the coverage available through the custodial parent (with a contribution towardthe cost by the noncustodial parent) should normally be preferred because it -- (1) most likely isaccessible to the child, (2) involves less difficulty in claims processing for the custodial parent, theprovider, and the insurer, and (3) minimizes the enforcement difficulties of the CSE agency orprivate attorney responsible for the case. (19)", "Some analysts caution that this policy may cause conflict if the state has to enforce a medical support order against the custodial parent, especially if the custodial parent contends that the reasonthe medical obligation was unmet was because the noncustodial parent failed to make his or hercontribution. Such conflict may occur because there is much confusion over whom the CSE attorneyrepresents. Most custodial parents believe that the CSE agency represents them when in fact theCSE agency represents the state."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accessibility of Health Care Coverage", "paragraphs": ["In general, private health care coverage that is available to the custodial parent usually is accessible to the child even if the plan coverage has a limited service area, as is the case with manyHealth Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). However, this may not be the case when it is the noncustodial parent whose health insurance coverage is being used, particularly if that coverage isprovided through an HMO. (20) Thus, for childrenliving far from their noncustodial parent, managedcare reduces the attractiveness of coverage under the noncustodial parent's plan relative to otheroptions for health care coverage. For example, HMO coverage in California may be useless to achild living in Massachusetts. Likewise, coverage available in upstate New York may be too faraway to be useful to a child living in New York City. According to one report, since managed careis now the norm and only 40% of noncustodial fathers live in the same city or county as theirchildren, this can be a serious problem. (21)", "Under the Medical Child Support Working Group's paradigm, when private health care coverage is available to a child, the CSE agency should consider the accessibility of covered servicesbefore it decides to pursue the coverage. According to the Working Group, children should not beenrolled in any plan whose services/providers are not accessible to them, unless the plan can providefinancial reimbursement for services rendered by alternate providers. (22)", "The Working Group recommended that federal regulations be developed to define \"accessible\" coverage and that it be made clear that coverage that is not accessible should not be ordered. TheWorking Group reported the following with regard to a definition of \"accessible\":", "Coverage is accessible if the covered children can obtain services from a plan provider with reasonable effort by the custodial parent. When the only healthcare option available to the noncustodial parent is a plan that limits service coverage to providerswithin a defined geographic area, the decision maker should determine whether the child lives withinthe plan's service area. If the child does not live within the plan's service area, the decision makershould determine whether the plan has a reciprocal agreement that permits the child to receivecoverage at no greater cost than if the child resided in the plan's service area. The decision makershould also determine if primary care is available within the lesser of 30 minutes or 30 miles of thechild's residence. If primary care is not available within these constraints, the coverage should bedeemed inaccessible. (23)", "In addition, the Medical Child Support Working Group cautioned that to be deemed accessible, the health care coverage also should be stable. The Working Group maintained that the decisionmaker should base accessibility partly on whether it can reasonably be expected that the health carecoverage will remain effective for at least one year, based on the employment history of the parentwho is to provide the coverage. In other words, it is the Working Group's opinion that it might notalways be feasible to pursue health insurance coverage in the case of parents who are seasonalworkers. Some observers contend that if noncustodial parents cannot provide continuous health carecoverage for their dependent children, it may be in the best interest of the child to receive privatehealth care coverage from the custodial parent or coverage from Medicaid or the State Children'sHealth Insurance Program (SCHIP) Under SCHIP, which was established in 1997, low-incomechildren may be better off without any coverage from the noncustodial parent, if that parent is unableto provide continuous coverage because some states do not grant SCHIP eligibility until childrenhave been uninsured for a waiting period of three or more months.

However, becausemedical support is of central importance to a good child support system, the Committee decided toask the Secretary to study the feasibility of using medical support as a performance measure and toreport her findings to Congress.

Federal regulations state that \"health insurance is considered reasonable in cost ifit is employment-related or other group health insurance.\" The definition deemingemployment-related coverage or group (e.g., union) health insurance policies to be per se reasonablein cost was first promulgated in 1985. It was justified by a 1983 study by the National Center forHealth Services Research, which found that employers paid 72% of the premium cost for low-wageemployees. The federal Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) thus concluded that mostemployment-related or other group health insurance is inexpensive to the employee/noncustodialparent. Rising health care costs have changed the picture. Recent research indicates that therequired employee contribution for health care coverage represents a much larger share of familyincome for low-income workers. Some data suggest that on average, employee contributions tofamily health care coverage premiums are equal to 45% to 52% of the typical cash child supportpayment. (28)", "Although federal regulations (45 CFR section 302.56) require that child support guidelines \"provide for the child(ren)'s health care needs, through health insurance coverage or some othermeans,\" they do not stipulate how this is to be done. In practice, integrating child support andmedical support can be difficult. Most states operate under the position that if the custodial parentprovides the health care coverage, the cash support award is suppose to increase, to reflect somecontribution from the noncustodial parent toward the cost. If the noncustodial parent provides thecoverage, the cash support award is suppose to decrease, to reflect the fact that the noncustodialparent is subsidizing the cost of health care coverage through a separate deduction from wagestoward the premium. The results may be problematic in that if the premium associated with thehealth care coverage is too high, cash support will be substantially reduced, leaving the custodialparent without enough money to take care of the child's food, clothing, and shelter needs. If cashsupport is not adjusted downward, however, poorer noncustodial parents will pay an unreasonablyhigh portion of their income as support. (29)", "Under the Medical Child Support Working Group's paradigm, in deciding whether to pursue private coverage, the cost of coverage should be considered. To the maximum extent possible,public dollars (through, for example, enrollment in Medicaid or the State Children's HealthInsurance Program (SCHIP) should be the payment of last resort. Moreover, according to theWorking Group, private insurance should not be ordered when its cost significantly lowers theamount of cash child support available to meet the child's basic needs and the child is eligible forsome other form of coverage. (30)", "According to a Policy Interpretation Questions memorandum, (31) issued by the Office of ChildSupport Enforcement, concerning \"reasonable cost\" of medical support, states in which the childsupport order is established by the courts can enact statutes governing their courts that define\"reasonable cost\" in a way that the state deems appropriate and still meet federal requirements. Forexample, under the Texas statute (Section 154.181(e) of the Texas Family Code) \"reasonable cost\"means the cost of a health insurance premium that does not exceed 10% of the responsible parent'smonthly net income.", "In contrast, states that set the child support order administratively through their CSE agencies would be subject to federal law and regulations, which stipulate that health insurance is consideredreasonable in cost if it is employment-related or other group health insurance.", "The Working Group recommended that federal policy be changed to reflect the view that if the cost of providing private health insurance coverage does not exceed 5% of the gross income of theparent who provides coverage, then the cost should be deemed reasonable, regardless of whether thechild support order was established by the courts or administratively by the state CSE agency.

There is general agreement that theCSE agency should work more closely with Medicaid/SCHIP to ensure that children who haveaccess to private health care coverage obtain such coverage, and that those who are eligible forpublicly-subsidized health coverage are covered by Medicaid or SCHIP.", "Alternate Methods to Offset Health Insurance or Medicaid Costs. Although focused solely on the state of Connecticut, a 1998 report by theHHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) found many noncustodial parents who were required bycourt order to provide health care coverage to their children were unable to meet their obligationbecause either their employers did not offer health insurance or available health insurance was notreasonable in cost. One of the report's recommendations was for Connecticut to requirenoncustodial parents to pay all or part of the Medicaid premiums for their dependent children. Thereport estimated that Connecticut would save about $11.4 million annually in combined federal andstate Medicaid costs if it required noncustodial parents to offset Medicaid premiums paid by the stateon behalf of the children of these noncustodial parents. (34)", "Similarly, a 2003 HHS OIG report focused on North Carolina found that about $17.4 million could have been collected from the noncustodial parents of 30,987 children to partially offset theMedicaid cost incurred by the state and federal governments to provide health care to thesechildren. (35) Although federal law does not requirenoncustodial parents to provide medical supportif the employer does not offer health insurance or the insurance is too costly, states have the authorityto modify state laws to require noncustodial parents to contribute to their dependent children'sMedicaid costs.", "In cases where a parent has access to private health care coverage but it is too costly, the child may then be enrolled in Medicaid, if eligible. In such cases, it may be less expensive for the stateif the child were enrolled in the private health care coverage. For example, the noncustodial parent'sshare of the private health insurance premium might be less than what the state pays an HMO for thechild's Medicaid coverage. In that case, many experts believe that it would make sense for Medicaidto pay the private health coverage premium. (36) Federal law allows individuals to obtain private healthcare coverage with a public subsidy. Specifically, section 1906 of the Social Security Act allowsstate Medicaid agencies to use Medicaid funds to purchase group health insurance coverage if suchcoverage is available to a Medicaid-eligible individual.", "Closing the Gap Between Those Eligible for Medicaid and ThoseEnrolled. In many cases, children are uninsured because private health insurancecoverage is not available through either parent, and the custodial parent has not enrolled the childin the available public health care system, i.e., Medicaid or SCHIP. One study estimates thatenrolling uninsured, child support-eligible children in Medicaid or SCHIP could reduce the shareof these children who are uninsured from 15% to 3%. According to some analysts, requiring thatthe child be enrolled in Medicaid or SCHIP (if eligible) when private coverage is not availableshould be a standard part of the child support process. Also, as mentioned above, considerationcould also be given to having the noncustodial parent contribute to any premiums, co-payments, ordeductibles associated with SCHIP coverage if the state in which the child is to be enrolled has aseparate SCHIP program that imposes these costs. These types of procedures might spread the costmore equitably between the parents, and between parents and the state. (37)", "If the state does not want to require enrollment in publicly-funded medical programs, it could provide information on the availability of the programs. It has been estimated that 66% of uninsuredchild support-eligible children are eligible for", "Medicaid, and another 15% are eligible for SCHIP. One of the main reasons for this lack of healthcare coverage of children who are eligible for public health care programs is that many parents donot know about Medicaid and SCHIP or do not know how to enroll their children. About one-thirdof the parents of eligible but not-enrolled children reported that they had not heard of Medicaid orSCHIP. Another 10% had difficulty with the enrollment process. An option would be for the CSEagency to provide parents with information about these programs and assist them in the enrollmentprocess. (38)", "The ability to move back and forth between the noncustodial parent's health insurance plan and an alternative source of coverage is an important factor in determining the best source of coveragefor a child whose noncustodial parent has access to employment-based health care coverage on anirregular or seasonal basis. According to one author:", "Transitions to and from Medicaid can be quite seamless, since children can remain enrolled in Medicaid even when they are also covered by the nonresidentparent's health care plan (in which case, the nonresident parent's health care plan takes precedence). However, if the alternative source of coverage is SCHIP, then the transition may not be seamless,since some states require a child to be uninsured for three or more months before gaining eligibility. Unless some exemption can be made for children losing coverage from a nonresident parent,SCHIP-eligible children whose nonresident parent can provide only irregular access toemployment-based health care coverage may be better off if some other form of medical support isrequired, such as a contribution to the health plan premiums paid by the custodial family, orcontributions toward co-payments and deductibles.
