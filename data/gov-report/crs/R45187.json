With DB pensions, participants receive a monthly benefit in retirement that is based on a formula. With multiemployer DB pensions, the formula typically multiplies a dollar amount by the number of years of service the employee has worked for employers that participate in the DB plan.", "Some DB pension plans have sufficient resources from which to pay their promised benefits. But, as a result of a variety of factors\u2014such as changes in the unionized workforce and the 2007 to 2009 recession\u2014many multiemployer DB plans are likely to become insolvent over the next 20 years and run out of funds from which to pay benefits owed to participants.", "The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is a U.S. government agency that insures the benefits of participants in private-sector DB pension plans. Although PBGC is projected to have sufficient resources to provide financial assistance through 2025 to smaller multiemployer DB plans, the projected insolvency of large multiemployer DB pension plans would likely result in a substantial strain on PBGC's multiemployer insurance program. In a report released in June 2017, PBGC indicated that the multiemployer insurance program is highly likely to become insolvent by 2025. In the absence of increased financial resources for PBGC, participants in insolvent multiemployer DB pension plans would likely see sharp reductions in their pension benefits.", "This report's data are from the public use file of the Form 5500 annual disclosure for the 2015 plan year (the most recent year for which complete information is available). Nearly all private-sector pension plans (including multiemployer DB plans) are required to file Form 5500 with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Department of Labor (DOL), and PBGC. The Form 5500 information includes breakdowns on the number of plan participants, financial information about the plan, and details of companies providing services to the plan. Multiemployer DB plans specifically are required to report their financial condition as being in one of several categories (referred to as the plan's \"zone status\").", "The insolvencies of these plans could affect the employers that contribute to multiemployer plans. For example, an employer in a plan that becomes insolvent plan might have to recognize the total amount of its future obligations to the plan, which could affect the employer's access to credit and, potentially, its participation in other multiemployer plans.", "This report provides data on multiemployer DB plans categorized in several ways. First, the report categorizes the data based on plans' zone status in 2015. Next, it provides a year-by-year breakdown of the number of plans that are expected to become insolvent and the number of participants in those plans. It then provides information on the 25 largest multiemployer DB plans in 2015 (each plan has at least 75,000 participants). Finally, the report provides data on those employers whose plans indicate they contributed more than 5% of the plans' total contributions (referred to in this report as \"5% contributors\") in the 2015 plan year. It lists (1) the 5% contributors whose total contributions to multiemployer plans were at least $25 million and (2) the 5% contributors in the 12 largest multiemployer plans (as ranked by total contributions to the plan) that are in critical and declining status."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background on Multiemployer Pension Plans", "paragraphs": ["In general, pension plans are a form of deferred compensation: workers do not receive income when it is earned but rather receive that income in the future. The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) provides tax advantages to certain deferred compensation schemes: rather than including such compensation in taxable income when it is earned, the compensation is included in taxable income when it is received by the individual (presumably, in retirement).", "Pension plans may be classified according to whether they are (1) defined benefit (DB) or defined contribution (DC) plans and (2) sponsored by one or more than one employer. With DB plans, participants receive regular monthly benefit payments in retirement (which some refer to as a \"traditional\" pension). With DC plans, of which the 401(k) plan is the most common, participants have individual accounts that are the basis of income in retirement. The plans that are the subject of this report are DB plans.", "Pension plans are also classified by whether they are sponsored by one employer (single-employer plans) or by more than one employer (multiemployer and multiple employer plans). Multiemployer pension plans are sponsored by more than one employer (often, though not required to be, in the same industry) and maintained as part of a collective bargaining agreement. Multiple employer plans are sponsored by more than one employer but are not maintained as part of collective bargaining agreements. The plans that are the subject of this report are multiemployer plans.", "Multiemployer DB pensions are of current concern to Congress because approximately 10% to 15% of participants are in plans that may become insolvent. When a multiemployer pension plan becomes insolvent, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) provides financial assistance to the plan so the plan can continue to pay benefits up to the PBGC guaranteed amount. With plans that receive PBGC financial assistance, there is a statutory maximum benefit that the plan can provide, currently equal to $12,870 per year for an individual with 30 years of service in the plan. The guarantee is not adjusted for changes in the cost of living.", "Using 2013 data, PBGC estimated that 79% of participants in multiemployer plans that were receiving financial assistance receive their full benefit (e.g., their benefits were below the PBGC maximum guarantee). Among participants in plans that were terminated and likely to need financial assistance in the future, 49% of participants have a benefit below the PBGC maximum guarantee, and 51% have a benefit larger than the PBGC maximum guarantee. Among ongoing plans (neither receiving PBGC financial assistance nor terminated and expected to receive financial assistance), the average benefit is almost twice as large as the average benefit in terminated plans. This suggests that a larger percentage of participants in plans that receive PBGC financial assistance in the future are likely to see benefit reductions as a result of the PBGC maximum guarantee level.", "PBGC estimates that in the future it will not have sufficient resources from which to provide financial assistance for insolvent plans to pay benefits at the PBGC guarantee level. Most participants would receive less than $2,000 per year because PBGC would be able to provide annual financial assistance equal only to its annual premium revenue, which was $291 million in FY2017. There is no obligation on the part of the federal government to provide financial assistance to PBGC, although some policymakers have stated that some form of federal assistance to PBGC might be necessary to ensure that participants' benefits are not reduced to a fraction of their promised benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Multiemployer Pension Plan Data", "paragraphs": ["CRS analyzed public-use Form 5500 data from the Department of Labor (DOL) for the 2015 plan year, the most recent year for which complete data are available.

In addition to Form 5500, pension plans are generally required to file additional information in specific schedules.

Plans report two values of liabilities: the actuarial value and the RPA '94 liability. The main difference is the value of the discount rate that is used to value plan liabilities. The actuarial valuation of liabilities typically discounts them using the expected return on assets. The RPA '94 valuation of liabilities discounts them using a lower rate, based on interest rates on 30-year Treasury securities. The RPA '94 valuation method results in a higher valuation of plan liabilities compared to the actuarial valuation method. Among plans that filed Schedule MB in 2015, the median RPA '94 rate was 3.51%, and the median rate used to calculate the actuarial value of liabilities was 7.5%. The discount rate used by PBGC is based on a survey of insurance annuity prices and is closer to the RPA '94 rate. For example, the PBGC for discounting multiemployer plan liabilities in 2014 (the most recent year available) was 3.54%.", "Among the 1,267 multiemployer plans in 2015 that submitted Schedule MB, 1,246 were underfunded (owed more in future benefits than had in current assets), 17 plans were overfunded (had more in assets than owed in future benefits), and 4 plans did not report any assets or liabilities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Zone Status of Multiemployer Plans in 2015", "paragraphs": ["The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA; P.L. 109-280 ) required that multiemployer plans that meet specified financial criteria must report to the IRS their financial condition as being in one of several categories.

The reduction in underfunding is by 33% during a 10-year funding improvement period (for plans in endangered status) or by 20% during a 15-year funding improvement period (for plans in seriously endangered status).

If a plan cannot emerge from critical status by the end of the rehabilitation period using reasonable measures (referred to as a plan that has exhausted reasonable measures, or an ERM plan), it must either install measures to (1) emerge from critical status at a later time (after the end of the rehabilitation period) or (2) forestall insolvency. Plans in critical status may not increase benefits during the rehabilitation period. In Table 2 , plans that are in critical status are classified by whether (1) they are projected to emerge from critical status within the rehabilitation period, or (2) they indicated that they have exhausted reasonable measures and would not emerge from critical status within the rehabilitation period and that the rehabilitation plan is designed to forestall insolvency.
