Separately, legislation ( H.R. 4761 ) that passed the House on June 29, 2006, would allow natural gas-only drilling in areas currently under the moratoria and give the states a larger share of the revenue generated from U.S. offshore leases. The bill also addresses royalty relief issues discussed below by establishing a \"conservation of resources\" fee for those leases without price thresholds. (For more information, see CRS Report RL33493, Outer Continental Shelf: Debate Over Oil and Gas Leasing and Revenue Sharing , by [author name scrubbed].)", "Royalty relief for OCS oil and gas producers has been debated during consideration of FY2007 Interior appropriations. On February 13, 2006, the New York Times reported that the MMS would not collect royalties on leases awarded in 1998 and 1999 because no price threshold was included in the lease agreements during those two years. Without the price thresholds, producers may produce oil and gas up to specified volumes without paying royalties no matter what the price. The MMS asserts that placing price thresholds in the lease agreements is at the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior. However, according to the MMS, the price thresholds were omitted by mistake during 1998 and 1999.", "A House committee amendment to the FY2007 Interior appropriations bill sought to require the Secretary of the Interior to include price thresholds in all leases (based on $34.71/barrel of oil and $4.34/thousand cubic feet of natural gas) and require the Secretary to renegotiate leases to conform with current price thresholds levels. This provision would have impacted the 1998 and 1999 leases and those shallow water deep-gas leases with price threshold levels currently around $9.90/thousand cubic feet. The committee language, however, was removed from the bill on a point of order during the House floor debate. Subsequently, the House agreed to an amendment that would prohibit funds in the bill from being used to issue new lease sales to current lessees that do not have price thresholds in their leases. Opponents of the amendment argued that the companies with valid leases, even though without price thresholds, should not be penalized. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved language on price thresholds, in an amendment during markup, that is similar to the House-passed version. The Senate Appropriations Committee also approved an amendment that would require the Secretary of the Interior to seek to renegotiate the leases to include price thresholds and to report to Congress on the results of such efforts. The amendment also sought to affirm the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to vary the suspension of royalties based on the price of production of a lease.", "Leasing in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico has been controversial over the past several years. There were several blocks that were removed by the Administration from Eastern GOM sale 181 that could become available for release after 2007, as part of the Administration's proposed five-year (2007-2012) leasing program. A Senate proposal ( S. 2253 ) would make available for lease about 3.6 million acres within the lease sale 181 area within one year of enactment of the bill\u2014prior to the next five-year lease program. Some coastal state senators are seeking to attach state revenue sharing language to the bill, while others oppose the bill because, they assert, it would offer leases too close to Florida's coast. Industry groups contend that Eastern GOM sales are too limited, asserting that the resource potential is significant. Environmental groups and some state officials contend that the risks of development to the environment and local economies are too great.", "Oil and gas leasing in offshore California also has continued to be a controversial issue. Under the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. \u00a71451), development of federal offshore leases must be consistent with state coastal zone management plans. In 1999, MMS extended 36 of the 40 leases at issue in offshore California by granting lease suspensions, but the State of California contended that it should have first reviewed the suspensions for consistency with the state's coastal zone management plan. In June 2001, the U.S. Court for the Northern District of California agreed with the State of California and struck down the MMS suspensions.", "The Bush Administration appealed this decision January 9, 2002, to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, after the state rejected a more limited lease development plan that involved 20 leases using existing drilling platforms.

For FY2007, the House has proposed $7.58 billion for EPA, and the Senate Appropriations Committee has recommended $7.53 billion. The President had requested $7.32 billion. All of these amounts are less than the FY2006 appropriation of $7.64 billion, including rescissions and supplementals. Congress made an additional $80.0 million available to EPA in FY2006 by rescinding and redirecting previously appropriated agency funds that had not been obligated for certain activities.

Nearly all the funding for the program in the Superfund account that the House, the Senate Appropriations Committee, and the President have proposed would be provided from general U.S. Treasury revenues. Three dedicated taxes (on petroleum, chemical feedstocks, and corporate income) historically provided the majority of funding for the Superfund program. These taxes expired at the end of 1995, and the remaining revenues were essentially used up by the end of FY2003. Since then, Congress has funded the program almost entirely with general revenues. Although cost recoveries from responsible parties, fines and penalties, and interest on the unexpended balance of the trust fund continue to contribute revenue to the Superfund program, these sources continue to be relatively small compared to general revenues. Some Members of Congress advocate reinstating the Superfund taxes and assert that the use of general revenues undermines the \"polluter pays\" principle. Other Members and the Administration counter that viable parties are still required to pay for the cleanup of contamination and that polluters are not escaping their responsibility. According to EPA, responsible parties pay for the cleanup at more than 70% of Superfund sites.", "There also has been ongoing interest in the adequacy of funding to clean up other contaminated sites, referred to as brownfields. The cleanup of these sites is funded separately from Superfund. Typically, brownfields are abandoned, idled, or underutilized commercial and industrial properties with levels of contamination less hazardous than a Superfund site, but that still warrant cleanup before the land can be safe for reuse.

This language appears to prevent ONHIR from forcibly relocating Navajo families in the near future, because of ONHIR's backlog of approved relocatees awaiting replacement homes. As the backlog is reduced, however, forced eviction may become an issue, if any remaining Navajo families were to refuse relocation and if the Hopi Tribe were to exercise a right under P.L. 104-301 to begin legal action against the United States for failure to give the Hopi Tribe \"quiet possession\" of all Hopi partitioned lands.

The sections on each of those agencies earlier in this report identify funding levels and other details for their land acquisition activities. Second, the LWCF funds acquisition and recreational development by state and local governments through a grant program administered by the NPS, sometimes referred to as stateside funding. Third, Administrations have requested, and Congress has appropriated, money from the LWCF to fund some related activities. This third use is relatively recent, starting with the FY1998 appropriation. Programs funded have varied from year to year. Most of the appropriations for federal acquisitions generally are specified for management units, such as a specific National Wildlife Refuge, while the state grant program and appropriations for other related activities rarely are earmarked.", "From FY1965 through FY2006, about $29 billion has been credited to the LWCF. About half that amount\u2014$14.3 billion\u2014has been appropriated. Throughout history, annual appropriations from LWCF have fluctuated considerably. Until FY1998, LWCF funding did not exceed $400 million, except from FY1977-FY1980, when funding was between $509 million and $805 million. In FY1998, LWCF appropriations exceeded the authorized level for the first time, spiking to $969 million from the FY1997 level of $159 million.

Not only did the total for federal land acquisition decline each year from FY2002 to FY2006, but each of the four component accounts declined each year (except NPS from FY2004 to FY2005).

A portion of this plan, the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), was completed in 1999, and provides for federal involvement in restoring the ecosystem. Congress authorized the Corps to implement CERP in Title IV of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (WRDA 2000, P.L. 106-541 ).

Some observers measure commitment by the frequency and number of projects authorized under CERP, and the appropriations they receive. Because no restoration projects have been authorized since WRDA 2000, these observers are concerned that federal commitment to CERP implementation is waning. Others assert that the federal commitment will be measurable by the amount of federal funding for construction, expected when the first projects break ground in the next few years. Some state and federal officials contend that federal funding will increase compared to state funding as CERP projects move beyond design, into construction. Still others question whether the federal government should sustain the current level of funding, in light of escalating costs and project delays.
