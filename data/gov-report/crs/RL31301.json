Producers who had the opportunity to insure the crop andwaived insurance for that year will be slightly penalized and receive a payment equalto 45% of the relevant price. All commercially grown crops are eligible for a paymentunder this formula except for sugar and tobacco, which have separate disasterpayment programs in the program. All producers must choose between a 2001payment or a 2002 payment, and may not receive a payment for both years' losses.The act limits the amount of the disaster payment so that the payment, in combinationwith crop insurance payments and the value of the crop that was not lost, cannotexceed 95% of the value of the crop had there been no losses. A participatingproducer also must agree to purchase crop insurance for the next two crop years, or,when insurance is not available, purchase coverage under the noninsured assistanceprogram for two years.

Themeasure also removes date restrictions for eligibility for the Livestock CompensationProgram (LCP), which USDA administratively implemented in 2002. TheCBO-estimated cost of the LCP provision is $100 million . USDA funded the LCPthrough the use of Section 32 funds, which are traditionally used to make surpluscommodity purchases.

P.L. 108-7 contains an appropriation of $1.477 billion for USDA'sinternational activities that are subject to annual appropriations (P.L. 480 food aid,salaries and expenses of the Foreign Agricultural Service, and administrativeexpenses for managing export credit guarantee programs). Of that amount, $1.2billion is authorized for humanitarian commodity donations under P.L. 480 Title II. In addition, P.L. 108-7 includes a supplemental appropriation of $250 million foremergency relief activities under P.L. 480, which will remain available throughFY2004. Not counting the additional $250 million, the total for appropriatedinternational programs is $344 million greater than enacted for FY2002 with mostof the increase going to humanitarian food donations. Additional spending forhumanitarian relief is a response to the Administration's decision to phase out foodaid based on commodity surpluses and to estimates by U.S. and international food aidagencies of large, urgent food needs in Sub-Saharan Africa, North Korea,Afghanistan and elsewhere. In light of estimated food needs around the world, theissue of food aid spending for emergency relief could be revisited during the 108thCongress. ", "The increase in food aid appropriations in the FY2003 omnibusappropriations act is in response both to large estimated global food needs and to theAdministration's decision to phase out food aid based on commodity surpluses orCCC funding. Proposed reductions in Section 416(b) (which uses surpluscommodities and CCC funds) are based on the Administration's review of food aidthat also recommended (in the FY2003 budget proposal) that all programs now runthrough private voluntary organizations (PVOs), cooperatives, and the World FoodProgram be placed in USAID, with USDA food aid activities confined togovernment-to-government programs. Consistent with this approach, theAdministration recommended in the FY2003 budget proposal an increase in P.L. 480Title II commodity donations to compensate partially for the phase-out of Section416(b) commodity donations.", "Initial Administration budget proposals also excluded any CCC funding inFY2003 for Food for Progress (FFP) which provides U.S. commodities to developingcountries and emerging democracies. CCC funding of this program has averagedaround $100 million annually in recent years. Under the President's proposals, anyFFP activity would have been be limited to government-to-government programsfinanced with money appropriated for P.L. 480 Title I. However, reauthorization ofthe FFP program in the 2002 farm bill ( P.L. 107-171 ), with continued reliance onCCC funding, complicated the efforts of the Administration to phase outCCC-funded food aid programs. P.L. 108-7 goes further and amends the FFP statueby requiring a minimum volume of 400,000 metric tons of commodities (whicheffectively entails CCC funding) and by requiring the President to enter into FFPagreements not only with foreign governments, but also with PVOs, coops, andintergovernmental organizations. Consequently, the President's FY2003 estimatesfor international programs now include $158 million of CCC funding for FFP.", "On the international level, the use of commodity surpluses to augment U.S.food aid has been criticized by the European Union, Australia, and other agriculturalexporting countries as an effort by the United State to circumvent U.S. World TradeOrganization (WTO) export subsidy reduction commitments. These trading partnersargue that much of U.S. food aid is being used to manage supplies rather than to meetemergency needs and that large food aid shipments impede sales of agriculturalproducts by and between developing countries. The issue of food aid andinternational agricultural trading rules is being pursued by U.S. trading partners in thenew round of multilateral trade negotiations launched at the end of 2001. ", "Consistent with its phase-out of Section 416(b), the President's budgetassumes that $118 million will be available for programming under Section 416(b)in FY2003. That would consist almost entirely of surplus nonfat dry milk held inCCC inventories. In contrast, $175 million of commodity assistance andtransport/distribution costs under Section 416(b) were funded in FY2002 and $948million in FY2001. ", "Mandatory Trade Programs. Inaddition to Section 416(b) and Food for Progress (discussed above), many otherUSDA international programs are funded through CCC borrowing authority. By farthe largest component of program level is accounted for by an estimated $4.225billion of CCC export credit guarantees, which guarantee payment for commercialfinancing of U.S. agricultural exports. The actual export value of credit guaranteesmade available in FY2003 will depend ultimately on market conditions and demandsfor credit. Historically, the value of such guarantees has rarely reached (or exceeded)the levels anticipated in budget requests. ", "U.S. export credit programs have also been raised as an issue in WTOagricultural trade negotiations. The EU and other trading partners charge that theprogram has a subsidy element (although it is much less than the subsidy representedby the EU's export restitution program) and gives the U.S. an unfair competitiveadvantage in exporting certain agricultural commodities. The United States took part in negotiations on export credit programs in the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development (OECD), but these negotiations did not succeed and were suspended. Any changes in the U.S. program that might result from tradenegotiations would have to overcome strong congressional support of these programsas they are presently constituted. ", "Two other CCC-funded programs assist trade organizations in their efforts to develop markets overseas for U.S. agricultural products. For the Market AccessProgram (MAP), the Administration assumes spending of $110 million and for theForeign Market Development (or \"Cooperator\") Program (FMDP), $34 million.These amounts are authorized in the 2002 farm bill ( P.L. 107-171 ).", "For one CCC-funded direct export subsidy program, the Export EnhancementProgram (EEP), the conference report limits CCC spending to $28 million. For itsreduction from the level authorized in the farm bill ($478 million), P.L. 108-7 scoressavings of $450 million. In the past, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) hasscored no savings for proposed cuts to EEP funding since actual spending in theprogram has been negligible (e.g., $1 million in FY2001, $0 in FY2002). However,the conference report estimate of savings is based on Office of Management andBudget's (OMB) scoring method (rather than CBO's) which allows dollar-for-dollarsavings for cuts from the authorized EEP level. For the other export subsidyprogram, the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP), the President's budgetanticipates that $57 million would be provided, an estimate that reflects the maximum permitted under international trade agreements.", "The 2002 farm bill established a new food aid program, the McGovern-DoleInternational Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program (IFED), and mandatedthat $100 million of CCC-funding be made available for FY2002. In subsequentfiscal years (FY2004-FY2007), \"such sums as necessary\" would be appropriated.
