Employers are to be required to monitor crystalline silica exposure if workplace levels may exceed 25 \u00b5g/m3 for at least 30 days in a year and provide medical monitoring to employees in those workplaces. In the case of construction workers, medical monitoring is required only if the new standards require workers to wear respirators for at least 30 days in a year.", "Construction industry employers are exempt from the PEL and exposure monitoring requirements if they comply with the engineering controls and work practices specified in the new standards.

For example, if a stationary masonry saw is used in construction, the employer is exempt from the PEL and requirement to measure silica exposure if the following controls and practices are used:", "Use saw equipped with integrated water delivery system that continuously feeds water to the blade. Operate and maintain tool in accordance with manufacturer's instructions to minimize dust emissions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Crystalline Silica in the Workplace", "paragraphs": ["Crystalline silica is a compound found in the earth's crust. It is a component of soil, sand, and other natural materials. The three most common forms of crystalline silica are quartz, cristobalite, and tridymite. Crystalline silica in dust commonly occurs when workers cut, saw, grind, drill, or crush materials such as glass, stone, rock, concrete, brick, or industrial sand. Exposure also occurs when industrial sand is used in abrasive operations, such as sandblasting, and in the hydraulic fracturing process. ", "The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) estimates that 1.7 million workers are exposed to crystalline silica in the workplace. However, NIOSH's estimates are based on 1986 data, which were published in 1991. In the preamble to its new crystalline silica standards, OSHA estimates that more than 2.3 million workers are potentially exposed to crystalline silica in the workplace, including more than 2 million workers in the construction industry.", "Crystalline silica particles can be 100 times smaller than normal sand particles. Because of their small size, these particles can easily enter the human respiratory system. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) National Toxicology Program has identified crystalline silica as a human carcinogen. The respiration of crystalline silica has been associated with the incurable disease silicosis and other respiratory diseases, such as pulmonary tuberculosis and lung cancer; auto-immune diseases, such as scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus; and renal disease and renal changes. ", "The health effects of crystalline silica and the link between occupational exposure to crystalline silica and silicosis and other diseases have been known since the beginning of the 20 th century, when cases of \"consumption\" and \"phthisis\" were documented among miners, stonecutters, glass workers, and other workers in the United States and other countries. In 1931, several hundred workers died of acute silicosis after being exposed to silica during the construction of Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation's Hawk's Nest Tunnel in Gauley Bridge, WV, making this exposure one of the deadliest single incidents of occupational disease in American history. ", "The federal government, under the provisions of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA), currently provides a $150,000 cash benefit and health benefits to workers, or their survivors, who contracted chronic silicosis as a result of digging tunnels in Alaska and Nevada used for the underground testing of atomic weapons."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rationale for the New Standards", "paragraphs": ["In the preambles to its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) and Final Rule, OSHA lays out a detailed rationale for the new crystalline silica standards. OSHA claims that based on an extensive review of existing literature and research that identifies links between exposure to crystalline silica and various medical conditions, including silicosis, cancers, renal conditions, and other diseases, the new standards will prevent more than 600 silica-related deaths each year and reduce monetarized benefits by reducing mortality and morbidity, which far exceed projected costs of compliance.", "In preparing its new crystalline silica standards, OSHA conducted a Preliminary Quantitative Risk Assessment and Final Quantitative Risk Assessment. Both assessments consisted of an extensive review of published literature and research on the health effects of occupational exposure to crystalline silica. OSHA performed these risk assessments in compliance with Section 6(b)(5) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act), which states, in part", "Development of standards under this subsection shall be based upon research, demonstrations, experiments, and such other information as may be appropriate. In addition to the attainment of the highest degree of health and safety protection for the employee, other considerations shall be the latest available scientific data in the field, the feasibility of the standards, and experience gained under this and other health and safety laws.... ", "Before the Preliminary Quantitative Risk Assessment, a draft health effects review document was subject to external peer review in accordance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidelines. As a result of the Final Quantitative Risk Assessment, OSHA concludes in the preamble to its Final Rule:", "[T]here is convincing evidence that inhalation exposure to respirable crystalline silica increases the risk of a variety of adverse health effects, including silicosis, NMRD [non-malignant respiratory disease] (such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema), lung cancer, kidney disease, immunological effects, and infectious tuberculosis (TB)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Permissible Exposure Limit", "paragraphs": ["The new standards set a uniform PEL of 50 \u00b5g/m 3 measured as an 8-hour TWA. If workers are exposed to crystalline silica above the PEL, they must be protected through engineering controls, such as using water to control dust generated by a work process or respirators provided by the employer. Because the PEL is measured as an 8-hour TWA, a worker can be exposed to levels above the PEL periodically during the work day, provided that his or her average exposure over 8 hours does not exceed the 50 \u00b5g/m 3 ."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Previous PELs", "paragraphs": ["Prior to the promulgation of the new crystalline silica standards, the OSHA occupational safety and health standards (the old standards) did not include a universal PEL for all industries and types of crystalline silica.

The PELs in the old standards are expressed as a formula of volume of crystalline silica per cubic meter of air, divided by the percentage of silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ); or as millions of particles per cubic foot of air, divided by the percentage of SiO 2 .

The updated PELs for general industry were not increased, but rather were converted from the outdated formulas to measures of \u00b5g/m 3 of air. In 1992, OSHA proposed changing the crystalline silica PELs for the construction, agriculture, and maritime industries such that all industries would have the same PELs of 100 \u00b5g/m 3 for quartz and 50 \u00b5g/m 3 for cristobalite and tridymite. These changes would have resulted in a reduction in the PELs for the construction and maritime industries. In 1992, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit vacated the 1989 changes to the PELs and mooted the 1992 proposed changes, thus returning the PELs back to their original levels set in 1971.

The ACC attributes this reduction, in part, to the current PELs adopted in 1971. ", "The CDC states that the reduction in silicosis deaths in this period is likely due to two factors. First, the higher numbers of deaths in the early period of the data may be capturing workers who were exposed to crystalline silica and contracted silicosis before the original OSHA PELs were implemented in 1971, mine safety regulations under the Coal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1969 and the Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, and a greater use of engineering controls and other measures to control crystalline silica exposure. Second, there has been a reduction in the number of workers in heavy industries, such as the mining industry, where silica exposure is prevalent.
