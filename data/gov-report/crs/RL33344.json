It proposed funding the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) at $34.1 billion, just over the FY2006 level (not including FY2006 supplementals related to Hurricane Katrina). HUD's FY2007 budget summary stated that the budget intended to use \"taxpayer money more wisely\" and \"reform programs in need of repair.\"", "The President's budget would have increased funding for the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program from $15.4 billion in FY2006 to $15.9 billion in FY2007. It proposed to reduce funding to the Public Housing Capital Fund to $2.2 billion from the $2.4 billion that was appropriated for FY2006. The proposed budget also would have eliminated funding for public housing's HOPE VI program, which replaces distressed public housing units with new or rehabilitated mixed-income developments. Within the community development programs, the President's FY2007 budget proposed cutting funding to the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program by nearly 20% from the FY2006 level. CDBG provides grants to states and localities to use for housing and community development projects. The FY2007 budget proposal would have increased funding for the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) program from $286 million to $300 million and the HOME program from $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. Additionally, it would have increased funding for the four Homeless Assistance Grants by $209 million, and provided funding for two new initiatives: the Samaritan Initiative for the chronically homeless and the Prisoner Re-entry Initiative. The President's budget proposed to cut in half funding for the Section 811 Housing for the Disabled program, as proposed in FY2006. The FY2007 budget would have provided $119 million for Section 811, down from $237 million in FY2006. Funding for the Section 202 Housing for the Elderly program would have been reduced from just under $735 million to $546 million, a drop of 25.7%.", "The House passed its version of the HUD funding bill on June 14, 2006 (H.R. 5576). It funded most programs at or near the President's requested level, although it increased funding for the Section 8 voucher program, CDBG, and the Section 202 Housing for the Elderly and Section 811 Housing for the Disabled programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee passed its version of H.R. 5576 on July 20, 2006. It would have provided over $2 billion more for HUD than the President's request and the House bill, increased funding for Public Housing and restored funding for programs slated for elimination, including HOPE VI.", "Since the majority of the FY2007 appropriations bills were not approved before the end of FY2006, Congress enacted a series of stop-gap funding measures, or continuing resolutions, to maintain government operations.

As can be seen in Table 2 , while the President's overall funding request is a slight increase over the previous year (1.6%), the amount of appropriations requested is actually a slight decrease (less than 1%). This seeming contradiction results from the reality that the amount of offsetting collections and receipts has been decreasing as the Federal Housing Administration's mortgage insurance programs have produced a smaller amount in offsetting receipts. From FY2006 to FY2007, under the President's budget, the amounts of offsetting receipts will drop by more than a billion dollars, from more than $1.6 billion to about $650 million. (For an expanded discussion, see \" Federal Housing Administration (FHA) \" and Table 16 .) With less available to offset the cost of the budget, higher appropriations are required to maintain the same funding level. At the same time, many programs\u2014such as the Section 8 voucher program\u2014require increased appropriations to maintain current service levels. Also, the President has set a goal of restraining domestic discretionary spending increases to at or below the rate of inflation, and has encouraged the executive branch Secretaries to examine programs to ensure that they are using taxpayer dollars wisely.

Congress has authorized the creation of more than 2 million vouchers over the history of the program, and the funding for virtually all of them expires every year. If a family is using a voucher to lease an apartment but funding is not sufficient to renew it, then the family will lose its assistance and likely lose its current housing. Prior to FY2004, HUD funded PHAs based on the number of vouchers they were using and the cost of those vouchers. If costs went up or PHAs were able to use more of their vouchers, they received additional funds to cover those costs. Since FY2004, Congress has moved away from funding PHAs based on their actual costs, and now provides agencies with a pro rata share of renewal funding based on what they received in the prior year. This formula change has provoked much controversy among low-income housing advocates and PHA advocacy groups, who argue that it does not reflect agencies' actual needs and results in some agencies receiving less funding than they need to maintain their programs, and others receiving more than they can use under the current law (for more information, see CRS Report RL33929, Recent Changes to the Section 8 Voucher Renewal Funding Formula , by [author name scrubbed]). The Administration's budget documents state that HUD supports the current budget-based funding formula, and that it complements the Administration's Section 8 voucher reform initiative, the Flexible Voucher Program proposal (for more information, see CRS Report RL34002, Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program: Issues and Reform Proposals , by [author name scrubbed]).", "The President's FY2007 budget requested $14.4 billion for voucher renewals, an increase of 3.5% over FY2006.

The amounts would then be reduced proportionally to fit within the amount appropriated. Agencies participating in the Moving to Work demonstration would be funded based on their contracts, but their budgets would be subject to proration. The President's budget request would have removed a clause included in the FY2006 appropriations law requiring that the entire amount of funding for renewals be obligated up front.

The House-passed version of H.R. 5576 would have funded the program at the President's requested level, while the version passed by the Senate committee would have funded the program at just under $20 million.
