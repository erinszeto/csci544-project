On June 25, 2007, the Administration released a revised text with new labor, environment, and other provisions. This \"final text\" language reflected a Congress-Administration \"New Trade Policy for America\" announced on May 10 that incorporated key Democratic priorities. Supporters of the agreement argue that Peru has ratified all eight International Labor Organization (ILO) core labor standards and that the PTPA would reinforce Peru's labor reform measures of recent years. Critics are concerned about the potential for enforcement of the standards. Peru PTA implementing legislation (H.R. 3688) passed the House on November 8, 2007, by a vote of 285 to 132; passed the Senate on December 4 by a vote of 77 to 18; and was signed by President Bush on December 14 (P.L. 110-138).

They also include (3) new limitations on \"prosecutorial\" and \"enforcement\" discretion, so that FTA countries cannot defend failure to enforce laws related to the ILO core labor standards on the basis of resource limitations or decisions to prioritize other enforcement issues; and (4) the same mechanisms/penalties for settling labor, environment, and all other FTA obligations. The Administration released the \"final text\" of the Peru FTA incorporating these concepts on June 25, 2007. On June 27, 2007, Peru's congress approved the FTA-related amendments. Other FTA language previously agreed to by both countries also includes procedural guarantees to help ensure that workers and employers would have fair, equitable, and transparent access to labor tribunals. Both parties would ensure that (1) workers have appropriate access to tribunals for the enforcement of each party's labor laws; (2) the proceedings before such tribunals are fair, equitable, and transparent; (3) the tribunals' final decisions are in writing and made publicly available; (4) parties to the proceedings have the right to seek review and possible correction of final decisions; (5) tribunals conducting or reviewing the proceedings are impartial and independent; (6) parties to the proceedings could seek remedies such as penalties or temporary workplace closures to ensure the enforcement of their rights under labor laws; and (7) public awareness of domestic labor laws is promoted through public availability of information and encouraging public education regarding labor laws.", "In addition, the agreement would require that the United States and Peru establish a Labor Affairs Council (Labor Council) comprised of cabinet-level or equivalent representatives to oversee implementation of the labor obligations, including the activities of the Labor Cooperation and Capacity Building Mechanism. The Labor Council would meet within the first year after the date of entry into force of the agreement and as often as necessary thereafter. Government representatives of the two countries would work together to establish priorities in specific cooperative and capacity-building activities. The Labor Council would establish guidelines, prepare reports, provide public communication, and be responsible for cooperating with the parties' points of contact.", "Finally, the two parties agreed that cooperation on labor issues plays an important role in advancing labor commitments, including those embodied in the 1998 ILO Declaration and a 1999 ILO convention on the worst forms of child labor (including child trafficking, or the use of children in armed conflict, drug trafficking, or pornography). They would establish a Labor Cooperation and Capacity Building Mechanism to develop and pursue bilateral or regional cooperation activities on labor-related issues.

President Toledo presided over a period in which Peru was one of the fastest growing economies in Latin America, largely due to growth in the mining and export sectors. In spite of the recent economic growth, over half of Peruvians live in poverty and a large portion of the population is underemployed. Unemployment and underemployment levels total 64.5% nationwide. Peru's labor market is relatively small compared with that of the United States. In 2005, the labor force of Peru comprised nine million workers, compared to 151 million workers in the United States. Recorded unemployment in Peru was 7.2% and labor cost per hour was $1.48 in 2005. In comparison, the United States had a recorded unemployment rate of 4.7% and an hourly labor cost of $24.42. The economic sector in Peru with the highest employment is wholesale/retail trade and repair services, followed by manufacturing.", "During the regime of former President Alberto Fujimori (1990 to 2000), the government implemented a radical economic reform program to control hyperinflation and bring economic stability to the country. Part of the program included a wide-ranging privatization plan and a relaxation of foreign investment restrictions to help increase foreign investment. Existing labor laws were relaxed significantly during this time. In recent years, however, Peru has made much progress in strengthening labor protections by implementing labor law reform and protecting workers' rights. In 2002, Peru ratified the two ILO conventions on the abolition of child labor. In 2003, the government reduced the number of workers needed to establish a union, eliminated prohibitions on workers that kept them from joining unions during their probationary period, and limited the power of the labor authority to cancel a union's registration. In July 2004, the government published regulations to strengthen labor inspections and broaden labor inspectors' powers to allow easier access to firms, improved inspectors' ability to impose sanctions, and increase the levels of fines.", "Peru has ratified 71 ILO conventions, including all eight core conventions on workers' rights. The ILO has stated that Peru has satisfactorily amended its laws to improve labor standards in certain areas related to freedom of association and protection of the right to organize.

Declines are projected in metals (gold, copper, and aluminum), rice production, and miscellaneous crops (cut flowers, live plants, and seeds) which could \"lose\" up to 0.2% of their employment, displaced by imports. For Peru, various estimates of job \"gains\" range from less than 20,000 to 700,000.
