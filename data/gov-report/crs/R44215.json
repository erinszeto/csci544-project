Some cargo ships serving U.S. non-contiguous trades have converted to LNG. Ferries, cruise ships, and other vessels that sail entirely or mostly in ECA waters also are interested in LNG as fuel. For safety and security reasons, LNG-fueled ships present budget issues for the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard has provided guidance on the placement of LNG fuel tanks on vessels, the protocol for LNG refueling operations in ports, and spill response requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Electronic Navigation", "paragraphs": ["A primary and resource-intensive function of the Coast Guard is installing and maintaining aids to navigation (ATON). This includes buoys, beacons, and other visual aids that mark and guide vessels through waterway channels. There are about 50,000 federally owned visual aids, according to the Coast Guard, and an equal number of non-federal visual aids. Because storms or ice can move buoys out of place and channels can move due to shoaling, the Coast Guard services about 134 buoys and fixed aids to navigation on an average day. Part of the Coast Guard's fleet includes 68 \"buoy tenders,\" which are vessels designed for the proper positioning of channel markers. Mariners continue to rely on these physical visual aids even though their vessels are typically equipped with virtual or electronic aids, such as GPS, AIS (automatic identification system), and electronic charts. These technologies, in essence, allow channel markings to be made known to a vessel operator by electronic transmission (e-navigation), either enhancing or potentially replacing a physical aid to navigation. The increase in size of the largest ships transiting U.S. harbors, as well as a general increase in the number of vessels on many waterways, places a premium on the accuracy of aids to navigation. The Coast Guard has begun testing electronic aids to navigation on the West Coast and the Mississippi River. ", "ATON activities consume about 20% of the Coast Guard's discretionary budget. While e-navigation offers the potential of significant savings in maintaining physical aids to navigation, key questions have yet to be answered. How reliable and resilient is e-navigation? Should e-navigation replace physical aids or merely supplement them? Are they as accessible to recreational craft? Are there cybersecurity concerns associated with e-navigation? The Coast Guard's ATON budgetary needs in coming years will depend on the answers to these questions.", "The Senate committee report requests a Coast Guard report on the feasibility and advisability of using e-navigation in U.S. areas of the Arctic Ocean.

In April 2015, the Coast Guard announced that it would be testing UAS in the Arctic for missions such as surveying ice conditions, marine environmental monitoring, marine safety, and search and rescue. The test unmanned aircraft could be launched from land or a Coast Guard cutter. ", "The House committee report recommended an additional $12 million above the President's request for the use of UAS aboard national security cutters. The omnibus incorporated this recommendation.
