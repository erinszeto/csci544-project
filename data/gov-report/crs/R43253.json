On March 28, 2002, a U.S. district court judge ruled that the congressional ban on the use of public funds to put such a ballot initiative before the voters was unconstitutional. The judge stated that the effect of the amendment was to restrict the plaintiff's First Amendment right to engage in political speech.

The District was free to use District funds for abortion services. When Congress passed the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY1989, P.L. 100-462 (102 Stat. 2269-9), it restricted the use of District and federal funds for abortion services to cases where the woman's life would be endangered if the pregnancy were taken to term. The inclusion of District funds and the elimination of rape or incest as qualifying conditions for public funding of abortion services were endorsed by President Reagan, who threatened to veto the District's appropriations act if the abortion provision was not modified. In 1989, President George H.W. Bush twice vetoed the District's FY1990 appropriations act over the abortion issue. He signed P.L. 101-168 (103 Stat. 1278) after insisting that Congress include language prohibiting the use of District revenues to pay for abortion services except in cases where the woman's life was endangered. ", "The District successfully sought the removal of the provision limiting District funding of abortion services when Congress considered and passed the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY1994, P.L. 103-127 (107 Stat. 1350). The FY1994 act also reinstated rape and incest as qualifying circumstances allowing for the public funding of abortion services. The District's success was short-lived, however. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY1996, P.L. 104-134 (110 Stat. 1321-91), and subsequent District of Columbia appropriations acts, limited the use of District and federal funds for abortion services to cases where the woman's life was endangered or cases where the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest. ", "In FY2010, with the passage of P.L. 111-117 , Congress lifted the prohibition on the use of District funds for abortion services, but maintained the restriction on the use of federal funds for such services except in cases of rape, incest, or a threat to the life of the woman. The position was reversed with the passage of the appropriations acts for FY2011 ( P.L. 112-10 ) and FY2012 ( P.L. 112-74 ). Those acts included provisions restricting the use of both federal and District funds for abortion services, except in instances of rape, incest, or the woman's life was endangered if the pregnancy was carried to term. ", "During the 112 th Congress, two bills were considered in the House that would have banned or restricted the provision of abortion services in the District of Columbia. On May 4, 2012, the House passed H.R. 3 , the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortions Act. The measure included a provision (Section 309) that would have permanently prohibited the use of federal and District funds for abortion services, except in instances of rape, incest, or a threat to the life of the woman. ", "On June 17, 2012, the House Judiciary Committee ordered reported H.R. 3803 , the District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. The bill would have permanently banned doctors and health facilities from performing abortions in the District after the 20 th week of pregnancy, except when the pregnancy would result in the woman suffering from a physical disorder, injury, or illness that endangers her life. It would have imposed fines and imprisonment on doctors who violated the act and would have allowed the pregnant woman, the father of the unborn child, or maternal grandparents of a pregnant minor to bring a civil action against any person who performed an abortion after the 20 th week of pregnancy. The act would have required any physician that performs an abortion to report specific information to the relevant health agency in the District, including post-fertilization age of the fetus and the abortion method used. The District health agency would have been required to compile such information and issue an annual report to the public. The District's delegate to Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton, though not allowed to testify before the Committee, spoke out against the measures as infringements on home rule.", "The Obama Administration's FY2014 budget request included a provision that would have prohibited the use of federal funds for abortion services except in cases of rape, incest, or when the woman's life would be endangered if the pregnancy were carried to term, but did not include language that would restrict the use of District funds for abortion services. S. 1371 , as reported, supported the Administration position restricting the use of federal funds. H.R. 2786 , as reported, included language that would have restricted the use of both federal and District funds for abortion services, except in instances of rape, incest, or when the woman's life is endangered. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2014, P.L. 113-76 , includes a provision consistent with the language included in the House Committee bill prohibiting the use of both District and federal funds for abortion services, except in instances of rape, incest, or when the woman's life is endangered."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "District of Columbia Opportunity Scholarship Program24", "paragraphs": ["The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004, P.L. 108-199 , which combined six appropriations bills\u2014including the FY2004 District of Columbia Appropriations Act\u2014authorized and appropriated funding for the Opportunity Scholarship program, a federally funded school voucher program for the District of Columbia. The program provides scholarships (also known as vouchers) to students in the District of Columbia to attend participating private elementary and secondary schools, including religiously affiliated private schools. P.L. 108-199 also provided funding for the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) for the improvement of public education and for the State Education Office for public charter schools. The provision of federal funds for DCPS, public charter schools, and vouchers is commonly referred to as the \"three-prong approach\" to supporting elementary and secondary education in the District of Columbia.

Appropriations for the program were authorized for FY2012 through FY2016 at $60 million each year. P.L. 112-10 requires that appropriations provided for the program to be divided evenly among DCPS for the improvement of public education, public charter schools to improve and expand quality public charter schools, and the Opportunity Scholarship program, regardless of the actual amount appropriated.

Rather than dividing these funds equally between the aforementioned three prongs, funds would have been allocated as follows: $30 million for DCPS, $20 million for public charter schools, and $2.2 million for the Opportunity Scholarship program. H.R. 2786 , as reported, would have provided $54 million for a federal payment for school improvement, with $18 million provided to each of the three prongs.

The council must act on the budget within 56 calendar days of receiving the budget from the mayor. The mayor then forwards the approved budget to the President, who transmits it to Congress. Once forwarded to Congress, the District's budget moves through the congressional appropriations process.
