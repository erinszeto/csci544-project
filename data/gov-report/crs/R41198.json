Under ACA, both married and unmarried children qualify for this coverage. The authorizing statute for CHAMPVA currently does not conform to this ACA requirement.

Health plans are required to sell and renew policies to all individuals and may not deny coverage for preexisting conditions or otherwise discriminate based on health status. Premiums may vary by limited amounts, but only based on age, family size, geographic area, and tobacco use. Also, plans must cover preventive services and immunizations recommended by various specified entities without any cost-sharing. Finally, young adults up to age 26 generally must be allowed to remain on their parents' health plans.", "Beginning in January 1, 2014, ACA requires most U.S. citizens and legal residents to have health insurance that meets the law's minimum essential coverage standard, or risk paying a penalty. The law creates competitive private health insurance marketplaces\u2014or exchanges\u2014in each state through which individuals and small employers are able to shop for, select, and enroll in qualified health plans. Plans offered through the exchanges, and certain other plans, must meet essential health benefit standards requiring them to cover emergency services, hospital care, physician services, preventive care, prescription drugs, and mental health and substance use disorder treatment, among other specified services. Refundable tax credits are available to certain individuals and families with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL) to help offset the cost of purchasing insurance coverage through the exchanges. These premium tax credits are available upon enrollment so that eligible individuals and families can choose to receive the subsidy immediately rather than wait until they file taxes the following year. ", "Since the enactment of ACA, concerns have been raised by veterans and Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs) on how the new law would affect TRICARE beneficiaries, as well as veterans and certain dependents receiving care through the VA health care system. Moreover, many have sought clarification as to whether certain provisions in ACA, such as a mandate for most individuals to have health insurance, or extending dependent coverage up to age 26, would apply to TRICARE and VA health care beneficiaries. Although the Obama Administration issued statements assuring that the two health care systems would not be negatively affected, some veterans groups have requested statutory clarification. To address some of these concerns, Congress has introduced and/or enacted legislation.

TRICARE was extended to Medicare-eligible military retirees, their Medicare-eligible spouses and dependent children, and Medicare-eligible widow/widowers by the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act of 2001 ( P.L. 106-398 ). This law established the TRICARE for Life (TFL) program, which acts as a secondary payer to Medicare and provides supplemental coverage to TRICARE-eligible beneficiaries who are entitled to Medicare Part A based on age, disability, or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In order to participate in TFL, these TRICARE-eligible beneficiaries must enroll in and pay premiums for Medicare Part B. TRICARE-eligible beneficiaries who are entitled to Medicare Part A based on age, disability, or ESRD, but decline Part B, lose eligibility for TRICARE benefits. In addition, individuals who choose not to enroll in Medicare Part B upon becoming eligible may elect to do so later during an annual enrollment period; however, the Medicare Part B late enrollment penalty would apply. ACA also waives the Medicare Part B late enrollment penalty during the 12-month special enrollment period (SEP) for military retirees, their spouses (including widows/widowers), and dependent children who are otherwise eligible for TRICARE and are entitled to Medicare Part A based on disability or ESRD, but have declined Part B. The Secretary of Defense is required to identify and notify individuals of their eligibility for the SEP; the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Commissioner for Social Security must support these efforts. This section was amended by the Medicare and Medicaid Extenders Act of 2010 to clarify that Section 3110 applies to Medicare Part B elections made on or after the date of enactment of ACA.

According to the VA, the increase will result from eligible non-enrolled veterans enrolling in the VA health care system to avoid the shared responsibility payment.

Specifically, it includes a provision (\u00a79011) that requires the VA to report to Congress on the effect on the VA health care system of the annual fee imposed by ACA on certain manufacturers and importers of branded prescription drugs, as well as the new excise tax imposed on the sale of medical devices by manufacturers, producers, or importers (see question on medical devices later in this report). Furthermore, it requires the VA to participate in the Interagency Working Group on Health Care Quality (\u00a73012), exempts the VA from a fee on all health insurers based on their market share (\u00a74377), and provides the VA access to the National Practitioner Data Bank without a charge (\u00a76403)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Do TRICARE and VA Health Care Meet \"Minimum Essential Coverage\" Requirements?", "paragraphs": ["The law specifies that TRICARE is generally considered minimum essential coverage for shared responsibility requirements under the ACA.
