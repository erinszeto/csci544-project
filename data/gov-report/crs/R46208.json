The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the primary regulator overseeing securities offerings, sales, and investment activities. The SEC's mission is to protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation. The existing securities regulatory regime generally aligns with this mission, and the SEC's digital asset regulation generally follows the same regime. The SEC has used existing authorities to evaluate new product approval, provide individual regulatory relief, and solicit public input for policy solutions more tailored to digital assets.", "Digital assets have a growing presence in the financial services industry. Their increasing use in capital markets raises policy questions regarding whether changes to existing laws and regulations are warranted and, if so, when such changes should happen, what form they should take, and which agencies should take the lead.

Some technological advancements led to regulatory changes, whereas others were dealt with through the existing regime.", "The general consensus is that regulatory oversight should be balanced with the need to foster financial innovation, but securities regulation's basic objectives should apply. In addition, some believe that certain digital asset activities that may appear similar to traditional activities nonetheless require adjusted regulatory approaches to account for particular operating models that may amplify risks differently. In general, policymakers contending with major financial innovations have historically focused on addressing risk concerns while tailoring a regulatory framework that was flexible enough to accommodate evolving technology. Current developments that raise policy issues include the following:", "Initial coin offerings (ICOs) .

The regulatory framework's key objectives are to promote disclosure of important market-related information, maintain fair dealing, and protect against fraud. As a result, the existing securities regulatory regime focuses on disclosure-based rules, an antifraud regime, and rules governing securities market participants (e.g., exchanges, broker-dealers, and investment advisors). The SEC's mission is to protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation.", "For example, one of the cornerstones of securities regulation\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Securities Act of 1933\u00e2\u0080\u0094is often referred to as the \"truth in securities\" law. As the phrase suggests, disclosures allow investors to make informed judgments about whether to purchase specific securities by ensuring they receive financial and other significant information on securities offered for sale. The SEC does not make investment recommendations. The disclosure-based regulatory philosophy is consistent with Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis's famous dictum that \"sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman.\"", "The current developments in digital asset trading and fundraising are not the first time securities regulators have had to accommodate new technology. Capital markets infrastructure has experienced continuous innovation since the securities regulatory framework was first formed in the 1930s. For example, securities trading platforms experienced a major revolution in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when trading processes shifted from paper and pen-based manual settlements in isolated markets to electronic platforms, which incorporate new data-processing and communications technologies that link all markets together. Congress responded to these advancements by amending Section 11A of the Securities Exchange Act to establish a national market system. The congressional objectives were to encourage efficient, competitive, fair, and orderly markets that are in the public interest and protect investors.

One rationale for this approach is that, because it is uncertain how the characteristics and use of digital assets will evolve, highly prescriptive regulations could become obsolete, and potentially inefficient. ", "The SEC's current regulatory framework that governs traditional and digital securities include the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. It has also used existing tools and a number of initiatives besides rulemaking to address specific regulatory issues arising from certain unique digital asset features. The SEC's approaches include the following: ", "Innovation office . The SEC created the Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology (FinHub) in 2018 to engage in financial technology ( fintech ), consolidate and clarify communications, and inform policy research. In 2019, FinHub conducted outreach meetings in multiple cities and published a framework for analyzing whether a digital asset is a security. Enforcement . The SEC has brought enforcement actions against securities token issuers and digital asset traders and asset managers, among others. The SEC established a new Cyber Unit and increased its monitoring of and enforcement actions against illicit cyber-based transactions. No-action letter s . The SEC uses no-action letters to provide relief for digital-asset-related businesses and to signal its regulatory intentions to capital markets. For example, the SEC issued a no-action letter to TurnKey Jet, a business-travel startup, stating that its issued tokens are not securities. This was the SEC's first no-action letter for an ICO. The letter triggered a wave of industry discussions and could set a precedent for future digital asset activities. Solicitation for public input . The SEC released a letter to the industry in March 2019 to solicit public input regarding digital asset custody. The comments may help the SEC understand the challenges the industry faces and assess investor-protection risks. New product approval . The SEC could approve or reject new digital asset products. For example, the SEC has reviewed Bitcoin ETF proposals in recent years and has consistently rejected such proposals as of 2019."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issues Raised by Digital Assets in the Securities Regulation Context", "paragraphs": ["Digital assets and their use in capital markets are a growing presence in the financial services industry's development.

In analyzing technological changes, some commentators suggest that society tends to overestimate a technology's effects in the short run and underestimate its effects in the long run. This illustrates the delicate balance between social pressure for change and the appropriate timing for policy responses in the face of innovation. ", "This section explains key examples of digital asset developments and use cases, focusing on policy issues and legislative proposals in the securities regulation context. The most salient digital asset-related policy issues include regulatory oversight and investor protection.", "Regulatory O versight . Digital asset issuers and investors face a steep learning curve in comprehending the regulatory landscape and determining how or if securities laws apply to them. It may not always be clear whether a digital asset is a security subject to SEC regulation. Multiple agencies apply different regulatory approaches to digital assets at the federal and state levels. For example, for certain digital assets, the SEC treats them as \"securities,\" the Commodity Futures Trading Commission treats them as \"commodities,\" and the Internal Revenue Service treats them as \"property.\" State regulators oversee digital assets through state money transfer laws, and the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network monitors digital assets for anti-money laundering purposes.

Digital asset investors\u00e2\u0080\u0094which may include less-sophisticated retail investors, who may not be positioned to comprehend or tolerate high risks\u00e2\u0080\u0094may be especially vulnerable to new types of fraud and manipulation, leading to questions about investor protection. First, there appears to be high levels of scams and business failures. A 2018 study from Satis Group, a digital asset advisory firm, found that 81% of ICOs were scams and another 11% failed for operational reasons. Second, many digital asset companies offering securities do not comply with SEC registration and disclosure obligations, potentially affecting investors' ability to understand their risk exposures. Third, the high volatility of digital assets' valuations can potentially result in large gains and losses, the risk of which may not be well understood by less-sophisticated investors. Lastly, digital assets operate outside the traditional financial system and thus may not offer common types of transaction protectio ns. For example, banks may have the option to halt or reverse suspicious transactions and associate transactions with the users' identities, but a digital asset transaction is generally irreversible through such intermediaries."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Initial Coin Offerings", "paragraphs": ["Businesses raise funding from capital markets through securities offerings, such as stocks, bonds, and digital assets. ICOs are a new fundraising mechanism in which projects sell their digital tokens in exchange for fiat currency (e.g., dollars) or cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin). A typical ICO transaction involves the issuer selling new digital \"coins\" or \"crypto tokens\" to individual or institutional investors. Investors pay for these tokens with either cryptocurrencies or traditional currencies. ICOs are often compared with initial public offerings (IPOs) of the traditional financial world because both are methods by which companies acquire funding. The main difference is that ICO investors receive digital assets in the form of virtual tokens or the promise of future tokens, unlike IPO investors who receive an equity stake representing company ownership. These coins or tokens are new digital currencies each company creates and sells to the public. Coin purchasers could redeem the coins for goods or services from crypto enterprises or hold them as investments hoping the coins would increase in value. Although every crypto enterprise is different, they generally make transfers without an intermediary or any geographic limitation. ", "Industry practitioners are increasingly using the term security token offering s (STOs) to describe ICOs. This change of terminology reflects the industry's acceptance that many ICOs are securities offerings and thus subject to securities laws and regulations. Securities laws require all securities offers and sales to either be registered under their provisions (as a public offering) or qualify for an exemption from registration (as a private offering). ICOs can take many forms. They can be listed on national exchanges as public offerings or be issued pursuant to the private securities offering exemptions. Operational and regulatory conditions\u00e2\u0080\u0094including investor access, maximum offering amounts, and filing requirements\u00e2\u0080\u0094differ depending on the type of offering an ICO selects. Table 1 illustrates examples of ICO fundraising options. ICOs could potentially use all the existing securities offering venues. They have already reportedly been issued under several of the private exemptions (e.g., Regulation D, Regulation Crowdfunding, and Regulation A). Although public offering ICOs are possible, as of year-end 2019, no ICOs have yet issued under this method.

However, many such platforms are registered as money-transmission services (MTSs) instead of SEC-regulated national securities exchanges. MTSs are money transfer or payment operations that are mainly subject to state, rather than federal, regulations. Because MTS regulations were not designed with digital asset trading activities in mind, some argue that they are insufficient in regulating the transfer of digital assets. In addition, these services raise investor-protection concerns because they are not subject to the more rigorous oversight as national securities exchanges. The SEC issued a statement in 2018 clarifying that the online platforms for buying and selling digital assets that qualify as securities could be unlawful.

Investors are perceived to have no idea whether the trading volume and prices reflect real activities or market manipulation. To take the more frequently studied digital asset Bitcoin for example, one study shows that 95% of Bitcoin's trading volume displayed on digital asset price and volume aggregator CoinMarketCap.com is either fake or non-economic in nature. Another widely cited academic study illustrates the scale of potential damage that digital asset market manipulations could create, underlining the investor-protection concerns in the digital asset space. The study argues that a single market manipulator likely fueled half of Bitcoin's 2017 price surge that pushed its price close to $20,000. The activities were reportedly carried out through the largest digital asset \"exchange\" at that time, Bitfinex, and used a stablecoin called Tether to boost the demand for Bitcoin. For this alleged manipulation, Bitfinex and Tether faced a class complaint seeking a total of $1.4 trillion in damages. Although Bitfinex and Tether rebutted the study, calling it \"bogus,\" they are currently under investigation by federal and state regulators.

It is difficult to predict the extent to which an SEC-regulated digital asset national exchange would have mitigated the market manipulations, or if the SEC's regulatory framework is the best fit for addressing all the digital-asset-trading-related policy concerns. Still, digital asset \"exchanges\" under the current operating environment appear vulnerable to misconduct.

This action is part of the digital asset industry's self-regulation discussion that is gaining momentum. For example, an international law firm's 2018 survey showed that the vast majority of the respondents thought the industry should formalize self-regulation and subject that self-regulation to regulatory oversight.", "Many digital asset trading platforms also reportedly sought to obtain exemptions from the SEC to operate as alternative trading systems (ATS). ATSs are \"dark pools\" that do not publicly display the size and price of their orders. ATSs face fewer regulatory requirements than national exchanges, but they must register as broker-dealers and meet certain SEC and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) compliance and filing requirements, such as custody, books and records, and regulatory examinations.

The SEC's custody rules impose requirements designed to protect client assets from the possibility of being lost or misappropriated. Custodians are important building blocks for the financial services industry. The custody industry for traditional assets is large and concentrated. In the past 90 years, financial custody has evolved from a system of self-custody to one in which major custodians provide asset custody for client accounts. Today, four banks (BNY Mellon, J.P. Morgan, State Street, and Citigroup) service around $114 trillion of global assets under custody. ", "Digital-asset custody has recently attracted regulatory attention because the SEC custody rules could pose unique challenges for custodians of digital assets. The custody rules were developed for traditional assets, which are easier than digital assets to secure and produce tangible tracks of physical existence or records. Digital assets generally lack physical existence or records produced by intermediaries, as seen in traditional assets such as gold or bank accounts. Common practice in the digital asset industry so far focuses on safeguarding private keys, unique numbers assigned mathematically to digital asset transactions to confirm asset ownership. This practice raises the question of how possession or control of a digital asset should be defined for regulatory purposes. The challenges include but are not limited to, for example, that a digital asset could have multiple private keys or that a single private key does not exist. As such, some believe the digital asset custody definition should go beyond the verification of the keys to incorporate holistic custody views. ", "Regulators are currently evaluating whether custody requirements should be adjusted to account for digital assets' unique operational characteristics. The SEC released a letter to the industry in March 2019 to solicit public input regarding digital asset custody. The SEC summarized a number of policy issues, including the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) to record ownership, the use of public and private cryptographic key pairings to transfer digital assets, the ability to restore or recover digital assets once lost, the generally anonymous nature of DLT transactions, and the challenges posed to auditors in examining DLT and digital assets.
