Roosevelt's New Deal, the Securities Act of 1933 and the Glass-Steagall Act (GSA) were enacted, setting up a pervasive regulatory scheme for the public offering of securities and generally prohibiting commercial banks from underwriting and dealing in those securities. GSA prohibited affiliations between banks (which, for the purposes of this report, means bank-chartered depository institutions, that is, financial institutions that hold federally insured consumer deposits) and securities firms (which are commonly referred to as \"investment banks\" even though they are not technically banks and do not hold federally insured consumer deposits); further restrictions on bank affiliations with non-banking firms were enacted in Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHCA) and its subsequent amendments, eliminating the possibility that companies owning banks would be permitted to take ownership or controlling interest in insurance companies, manufacturing companies, real estate companies, securities firms, or any other non-banking company. As a result, distinct regulatory systems developed in the United States for regulating banks, on the one hand, and securities firms on the other.", "Banks are institutions of limited power; they may only engage in the activities permissible pursuant to their charter, which generally limits them to the \"business of banking\" and all powers incidental to the business of banking. Included in these activities restrictions are certain limitations on their ability to engage in proprietary trading, that is, investing as principal, rather than at the behest or for the benefit of customers, for the bank's own account. In addition to activity restrictions, banks are subject to capital standards, affiliation restrictions, management interlocking restrictions, and many other standards; they are subject to regular examinations to ensure they are being well-managed, conducting business in a safe and sound fashion, and complying with numerous consumer protection and other laws; and federal banking regulators have a full range of strong and flexible enforcement tools, such as prompt corrective action powers, to rectify problems that are found during examinations.", "One of the benefits of being a bank, and thus being subjected to heavy, expensive regulation, is access to what is referred to as the \"federal safety net,\" which includes the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's (FDIC's) deposit insurance, the Federal Reserve's discount window lending facility, and the Federal Reserve's payment system.", "The regulation and oversight of securities firms are very different from that of banks. Securities firms may be primarily regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at the federal level, or they may not be regulated directly at the federal level at all, which often is the case for hedge funds, private equity firms, and special purpose vehicles (SPVs). Rather than regulating for safety and soundness, the SEC's regulatory regime is predominately built around registration, disclosure of risk, and the prevention and prosecution of insider trading and other forms of fraud. SEC-regulated firms generally are not subject to capital and liquidity standards or to regular safety and soundness examinations. And aside from a general prohibition on accepting federally insured consumer deposits, securities firms generally are not subject to activity restrictions, as are banks. As a result, these institutions generally do not have access to the federal safety net.", "While there are two distinct regulatory systems, the distinguishing lines between the traditional activities engaged in by commercial and investment banks became increasingly difficult to discern as a result of competition, financial innovation, and technological advances in combination with permissive agency and judicial interpretation. Beginning in the late 1970s, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), as the primary regulator for bank holding companies (BHCs), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), as the primary regulator for national banks, issued a series of regulations and orders, liberally interpreting the limitations imposed on the activities of commercial banks through laws such as the GSA and the BHCA. The result was the incremental expansion of the types and levels of securities activities permissible for BHCs and financial subsidiaries of banks. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA) continued this trend by repealing two of the four sections of the GSA and the BHCA and by establishing the financial holding company (FHC) structure, which permits commercial banks and full-service investment banks (as well as insurance companies) to coexist under common control.", "In the wake of the Great Recession of 2008, there have been calls to reexamine the activities that should be permissible for commercial banks in light of the fact that they receive governmental benefits through access to the federal safety net. Some have called for the reenactment of the repealed provisions of the GSA, which is discussed in greater detail in another CRS report.", "While neither the House- nor the Senate-passed version of H.R. 4173 , the comprehensive financial regulatory reform proposals of the 111 th Congress, includes provisions that would reenact the GSA, both bills do propose curbs on \"proprietary trading\" by banking institutions.

For several decades after the enactment of the GSA, banks did not attempt to expand beyond traditional banking activities to a significant degree. This trend began to change in the 1970s. High inflation, coupled with a consumer movement to interest-bearing accounts and investment products, such as money market funds offered by securities firms, reduced the profitability of traditional bank products. Corporate consumers also began moving to securities firms for short-term lending (e.g., through the commercial paper market), which, for some, was less expensive than borrowing directly from banks. Facing lower profits and stiffer competition from securities firms, banks began seeking approval from regulators to engage in a greater universe of securities activities. Additionally, regulators may have become less cautious as time passed after the Great Depression.", "Beginning in the 1970s and 1980s, requests for approval to engage in a greater universe of securities activities were largely granted by the OCC and the FRB, and, in most cases, have been approved by courts. By the time that the GLBA was enacted in 1999, the FRB had authorized certain BHCs and their subsidiaries to underwrite and deal in an array of bank-ineligible securities, including municipal bonds, commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities and other consumer-related securities, corporate debt securities, and corporate equity securities. In addition to underwriting and dealing activities, the FRB also approved other securities activities such as the provision of investment advice, the brokering of securities, and others. The FRB promulgated the list of permissible nonbanking activities at 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 225.28(b). With respect to securities-related activities, the regulation includes two distinct categories: (1) agency functions for customers and (2) transactions as principal (i.e., for the company's own account, often referred to as \"proprietary trading\"). In the latter category are the following: (1) \"[u]nderwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments\"; (2) \"[i]nvesting and trading activities\" in certain swaps, futures, options, foreign exchange, and other derivative contracts; and (3) \"buying and selling bullion and related activities.\" The FRB requires banks to adhere to a number of limitations and conditions, largely spelled out in regulation, in order to engage as principal in each of these three categories.

The GLBA permits FHCs to engage in and own companies engaging in (1) activities that are \"financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity\" or (2) activities that are \"complementary to a financial activity\" and do \"not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of the depository.\" The GLBA listed certain activities as \"financial in nature,\" including all the nonbanking activities which had already been authorized for BHCs. The GLBA empowered the FRB, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, to issue orders or regulations supplementing that list.", "Merchant Banking Investments. Under the GLBA and rules promulgated jointly by the Secretary of the Treasury and the FRB, FHCs with a securities affiliate or an insurance affiliate with an investment adviser affiliate may engage in what is referred to as merchant banking activities, under certain conditions. Merchant banking means to \"directly or indirectly and as principal or on behalf of one or more persons, ... acquire or control any amount of shares, assets or ownership interests of a company or other entity that is engaged in any activity not otherwise authorized for the financial holding company.\" FHC merchant banking investments must be \"part of a bona fide underwriting or merchant or investment banking activity.\" Additionally, the interests must only be held on a temporary basis and, in general, no longer than 10 years. Under the regulation, the shares in such investments may be acquired by any subsidiary of the FHC other than a depository institution subsidiary. If assets other than debt or equity securities are involved, they must be \"held or promptly transferred to a portfolio company.\" \"Portfolio company,\" in this context, is merely the term used for the company to which these assets must be transferred. Depository institution subsidiaries of the FHC may not routinely manage the portfolio company. There also are restrictions designed to prevent the FHC from routinely managing or operating the portfolio company. For example, executive officers of the holding company and of certain subsidiaries of the holding company, including its securities broker and depository institution subsidiaries, may not serve as executive officers of the portfolio company. Despite these restrictions, however, there is a provision which permits an FHC to routinely, but on a temporary basis, manage a portfolio company; this may occur \"only when intervention by the financial holding company is necessary or required to obtain a reasonable return on the financial holding company's investment in the portfolio company upon resale or other disposition of the investment, such as to avoid or address a significant operation loss or in connection with a loss of senior management at the portfolio company.\" The FRB's prior approval is not generally required for an FHC to engage in merchant banking activities unless the proposed investment will result in the aggregate carrying value of all merchant banking investments to exceed a certain level.", "Merchant Banking Investments Through a Private Equity Fund . An FHC also may make merchant banking investments though a private equity fund that makes investments in nonfinancial companies, provided the private equity fund meets certain qualifications and the FHC's investments comply with requirements for merchant banking. \"Private equity fund\" is defined, for this purpose, as a company \"formed for the purpose of and is engaged exclusively in the business of investing in shares, assets, and ownership interests of financial and nonfinancial companies for resale or other disposition.\" The private equity company must not be an operating company; no more than 25% of its equity may be held by the FHC or any of its officers, directors, employees or principal shareholders; its term must be no longer than 15 years; and it must not have been formed to evade the merchant banking restrictions on FHCs. If an FHC makes investments through a private equity fund, the investments will generally be subject to a 15-year limitation rather than the 10-year limit that would apply if the FHC were to make direct investments. If an FHC controls a private equity fund, the FHC may not routinely operate the private equity fund. ", "Federal Reserve Act (FRA) \u00a7\u00a7 23A, which imposes limitations on \"covered transactions\" between a bank and its affiliates, and 23B, which requires certain transactions to be on market terms, apply to transactions between an FHC and its subsidiaries and the private equity fund only if control exists.", "The regulations presume control for applicability of sections 23A and 23B if the FHC controls more than 15% of the private equity firm's total equity. This presumption may be rebutted with contrary evidence presented to the FRB or by showing the existence of any one of the following presumptions against control: (1) none of the FHC's officers, directors, or employees serves as a director or trustee of the firm; (2) another person or entity holds more of the total equity of the firm than does the FHC and no more than one of the FHC's officers, directors, or employees serves as a director or trustee of the firm; (3) another person or entity controls more than 50% of the voting shares of the firm and the officers, directors, or employees of the FHC do not constitute a majority of the directors or trustees of the firm.", "On June 22, 2000, the FRB issued guidance on FHCs' equity investments and merchant banking activities. This guidance focuses on sound policies and practices, including board of directors oversight; limits on and controls with respect to types and amounts of investments; periodic reviews of investments and of the component elements of the investment process; assessment of possible investment performance under various circumstances; internal controls adopted to types of investments; exit strategies; and capital allocation based on risk. There are also guidelines on transactions involving the portfolio company which are not subject to the FRA \u00a7\u00a7 23A and 23B. FHCs are urged to", "have systems and policies in place to monitor transactions between the holding company, or a non-depository institution subsidiary of the holding company, and a portfolio company ...

In general, banking entities will be given two years to divest nonconforming activities.", "Di vestiture of Nonconforming Activities. Subsection (c) addresses divestiture of nonconforming activities. Divestiture of nonconforming activities is generally required within two years of enactment subject to certain exceptions. The FRB is to issue rules on the divestiture provisions within six months of enactment. Additional capital and other restrictions, including margin requirements, on ownership interests in or sponsorship of hedge funds or private equity funds by banking entities are to be implemented by rules promulgated within the context of the joint rulemaking. The two-year divestiture requirement may be extended under certain circumstances: (1) the FRB may approve extensions for one-year periods not to exceed three additional years, and (2) if a contractual obligation in effect on May 1, 2010, requires a banking entity to take or retain its ownership interest in, or provide additional capital to, an illiquid fund, the entity may apply to the FRB for an extension which may be granted for no more than five years; divestiture would be required at the end of the five years or on the contractual date\u2014whichever is earlier.", "Permitted Activities . Subsection (d) identifies exceptions to the blanket prohibitions of subsection 619(a) by listing permitted activities and setting conditions under which those activities may be conducted. It excludes from permitted activities any transaction or class of activities, otherwise permitted, that would involve or result in a material conflict of interest; a material exposure by the banking entity to \"high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies\" as defined by the regulators; or a threat to safety and soundness of the banking entity or to the financial stability of the United States. It provides standards by which the regulators may set further limits or conditions on these activities and includes authority for the regulators to add to the list of permitted activities. The regulators may impose additional capital and quantitative limits as \"appropriate to protect the safety and soundness of banking entities engaged in such activities.\" Among the conditions specified for conducting these activities are that the activity must (1) be permitted under other federal or state law; (2) be subjected to restrictions as determined by the appropriate federal regulators; and (3) not involve or result in a material conflict of interest, expose the banking entity to \"high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies,\" or threaten safety and soundness of the banking entity or the financial stability of the United States. Subject to those conditions, the exceptions or permitted activities are:", "Organizing and Advising Hedge or Private Equity Funds in Connection with Fiduciary or Trust Services . Subsection (d)(1)(G) authorizes banking entities to organize and offer private equity or hedge funds only if (1) the banking entity provides \"bona fide trust, fiduciary, or investment advisory services\"; (2) the fund is offered only in connection with trust, fiduciary, or investment advisory services to \"persons that are customers of such services of the banking entity\"; (3) the banking entity retains only a de minimis interest in the funds; (4) the banking entity and its affiliates engage in no transaction with the fund that would be designated as a covered transaction under FRA section 23A and other transactions with the fund are conducted only on terms specified in FRA section 23B, as if the banking entity were a member bank, and the fund an affiliate of that bank; (5) the banking entity does not guaranty the obligations of the hedge fund or private equity fund; (6) the banking entity does not share a name with the hedge fund or private equity fund; (7) no director or employee of the banking entity, other than a director or employee directly engaged in providing investment advisory or other services to the hedge fund or private equity fund, takes or retains an interest in the fund; and (8) the banking entity takes certain steps to assure the investors in the hedge fund or private equity fund that losses of the fund will be borne solely by its investors.

Subsection (d)(1)(C) authorizes \"risk-mitigating hedging activities\" that are related to \"positions, contracts, or other holdings of the banking entity and are designed to reduce specific risks in connection with and related to such holdings.

Insurance Company Portfolio Investments. Subsection (d)(1)(F) authorizes the \"purchase, sale, acquisition, or disposition of securities and other instruments\" which the regulators have determined by rule to fall within the definition of \"proprietary trading\" under subsection (h)(4) if the transactions are \"by a regulated insurance company directly engaged in the business of insurance for the general account of the company by any affiliate of such regulated insurance company, provided that such activities by any affiliate are solely for the general account of the regulated insurance company.\" The transactions must also comply with applicable law, regulation, or guidance, and there must be no determination by the regulators that a relevant law, regulation, or guidance is insufficient to protect the safety and soundness of the banking entity or the financial stability of the United States. Proprietary Trading by Foreign Companies Conducted Outside the United States . Subsections (d)(1)(H) and (I) authorize investments permitted under sections 4(c)(9) and 4(c)(13) of the Bank Holding Company Act, provided they are conducted solely outside the United States by a company not controlled directly or indirectly by a company organized under the laws of the United States or of a state. Other Investments . Subsection (d)(1)(J) provides the regulators with authority to permit \"[s]uch other activity \u2026 by rule, \u2026 [as] would promote and protect the safety and soundness of the banking entity and the financial stability of the United States.\" De Minim i s Investments by Banking Entities in Hedge Funds and Private Equity Funds. Subsection 619(d)(4) permits banking entities, subject to certain limitations, to make and retain a \"de minimis investment\" in a hedge fund or private equity fund or to make an initial investment in a hedge fund or private equity fund that the banking entity organizes. Among the limitations is a requirement to seek unaffiliated investors to reduce, within one year (subject to a possible extension for two more years), the banking entity's initial investment to the prescribed de minimis amount, as defined in subsection (d)(4). A de minimis investment must be (1) \"not more than 3 percent of the total ownership interests of the fund,\" (2) \"immaterial to the banking entity, as defined by rule\" and (3) such that the aggregate investment of the banking entity in all such funds does not exceed 3 percent of its Tier 1 capital. There is also a requirement that a banking entity's aggregate outstanding de minimis or initial investments in hedge funds or private equity funds organized by the banking entity, including retained earnings, must be deducted from assets and tangible equity of the banking entity and the amount of the deduction to \"increase commensurate with the leverage of the hedge fund or private equity fund.\"", "Limitation on Relationships with Hedge Funds and Private Equity Funds . Under subsection 619(f), a banking entity serving as \"an investment manager, investment advisor, or investment sponsor to a hedge fund or private equity fund\" or a banking entity which organizes and offers a hedge fund or private equity fund in connection with fiduciary or trust services as specified in subsection (d)(1)(G) or any affiliates thereof may enter into a transaction with the fund which would be a covered transaction under FRA section 23A if the banking entity and affiliate were a member bank and the fund were an affiliate thereof. In addition, any transaction between the banking entity and the fund must comply with Section 23B of the FRA as if the banking entity were a member bank and the fund, an affiliate, thereof. The FRB may permit a banking entity to enter into a prime brokerage transaction with any hedge fund or private equity fund in which a hedge fund or private equity fund managed, sponsored, or advised by the banking entity or nonbank financial company has an ownership interest under certain conditions. The banking entity must be in compliance with all of the conditions under which a banking entity may organize and advise a hedge fund or private equity fund in connection with fiduciary or trust services under subsection (d)(1)(G). Moreover, the banking entity's chief executive officer must provide an annual, and updated as necessary, written certification of compliance. The FRB must have determined that the primary brokerage agreement is consistent with the safe and sound operation of the banking entity; moreover, the prime brokerage transaction is subject to FRA section 23B as if the counterparty were an affiliate of the banking entity. Additional capital charges or other restrictions for nonbank financial companies are to be covered by rules issued by the appropriate regulators in the prescribed joint rulemaking proceedings.", "Anti-Evasion Provision. Subsection (e) authorizes the appropriate regulator, having reasonable cause to believe that a banking entity or a nonbank financial company supervised by the FRB, is engaged in activities functioning as an evasion of section 619, or in violation of section 619, to order, subject to notice and opportunity for a hearing, termination of the activity and disposition of the investment. This subsection also requires the regulators to issue internal control and recordkeeping rules to insure compliance with section 619.", "Rules of Construction. Subsection 619(g) provides three rules of statutory construction for interpreting section 619: (1) the prohibitions and restrictions of section 619 apply, except as provided in the section, notwithstanding the existence of other provisions of law authorizing such activities; (2) nothing in section 619 is to \"be construed to limit the ability of a banking entity or nonbank financial company \u2026 to sell or securitize loans in a manner otherwise permitted by law\"; and (3) nothing in section 619 is to \"be construed to limit the inherent authority of any Federal agency or State regulatory authority under otherwise applicable provisions of law.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Future Prospects: Rulemaking and Mandated Study", "paragraphs": ["While the Conference Committee was at work, there appeared to be some apprehension within the financial services industry about the reach of \u00a7 619, the imprecision of its definitions and prohibitions, and its implementation. Some concerns may have been allayed by the Conference Report's final version of section 619. For example, there are specific provisions providing for (1) distinct treatment for insurance company portfolio investments; (2) the ability of banking entities and non-financial companies determined to be systemically important to sponsor hedge fund and private equity funds that are limited to customer investments; (3) conditions under which bank investments in hedge funds and private equity funds may be permitted; and (4) phase-in periods. Although the outlines of a new regulatory framework for proprietary trading and hedge fund operations of banking entities and other systemically important companies are fully outlined in the legislation, the actual reach and practical effect of the provisions await the clarifying hand of the regulators. To illustrate, subsection (d)(1)(C) authorizes banking entities to engage in \"risk-mitigating hedging activities\" related to \"positions, contracts, or other holdings of the banking entity that are designed to reduce specific risks to a banking entity in connection with and related to such positions, contracts or other holdings.\" It delineates no parameters for these hedging activities. With this and other provisions of the bill, there is likely to be an intensive rulemaking process wherein virtually every possible interpretation of the statutory language will be subjected to a full airing.", "It also might be noted that a related provision of the legislation provides clear indication that Congress will continue to monitor the scope of investment activities permitted to banking concerns. Section 620 of the Conference Report gives the federal banking agencies 20 months to study and report on investment and other activities that banking entities may conduct under federal and state law. The agencies are to evaluate and make recommendations on (1) types of activities or investments; (2) associated risks; (3) risk mitigation activities; (4) safety and soundness concerns; (5) potential negative effects of each activity with respect to banking entities and the U.S. financial system; (6) whether each activity or investment is appropriate for banking entities; and (7) any necessary additional restrictions.", "Appendix A.
