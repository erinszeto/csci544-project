In FY2013, CHIP enrollment totaled 8.4 million individuals and CHIP expenditures totaled $13.2 billion.", "Under the CHIP program, the federal government sets basic requirements for CHIP, but states have the flexibility to design their own version of CHIP within the federal government's basic framework. As a result, there is significant variation across CHIP programs. Currently, state upper-income eligibility limits for children range from a low of 175% of the federal poverty level (FPL) to a high of 405% of FPL. States may also extend CHIP coverage to pregnant women when certain conditions are met.", "States may design their CHIP programs in three ways: a CHIP Medicaid expansion, a separate CHIP program, or a combination approach where the state operates a CHIP Medicaid expansion and one or more separate CHIP programs concurrently. CHIP benefit coverage and cost-sharing rules depend on program design. CHIP Medicaid expansions must follow the federal Medicaid rules for benefits and cost sharing, which entitles CHIP enrollees to Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) coverage (effectively eliminating any state-defined limits on the amount, duration, and scope of any benefit listed in Medicaid statute) and exempts the majority of children from any cost sharing. For separate CHIP programs, the benefits are permitted to look more like private health insurance, and states may impose cost sharing, such as premiums or enrollment fees, with a maximum allowable amount that is tied to annual family income.", "The federal government reimburses states for a portion of every dollar they spend on CHIP (including both CHIP Medicaid expansions and separate CHIP programs) up to state-specific annual limits called allotments. The federal share of FY2013 total expenditures was $9.2 billion and the state share was $4.0 billion.", "CHIP was enacted in 1997. Since that time, Congress has extended federal CHIP funding. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148, as amended) extended CHIP funding through FY2015. On April 16, 2015, President Obama signed into law the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA; P.L. 114-10). MACRA repeals the sustainable growth rate (SGR) mechanism (which overrides the reduction in the Medicare physician fee schedule that was set to begin in April 2015) and extends funding for CHIP, among other provisions. Specifically, MACRA extends CHIP funding for two additional years (i.e., through FY2017) and maintains the current allotment formula, including a 23 percentage point increase to the enhanced federal medical assistance percentage (E-FMAP). MACRA also extends the \"qualifying state\" option, the Child Enrollment Contingency Fund, \"Express Lane\" eligibility, Outreach and Enrollment Grants, the Pediatric Quality Measures Program, and the Childhood Obesity Demonstration Project.", "Although MACRA adds two additional years to federal funding for CHIP (through FY2017), states still need to adhere to the ACA's maintenance of effort (MOE) requirements that are in effect through FY2019. The MOE requires states to maintain income eligibility levels for CHIP children through September 30, 2019, as a condition for receiving federal Medicaid payments (notwithstanding the lack of corresponding federal CHIP appropriations for FY2018 and FY2019). The MOE requirements impact CHIP Medicaid expansion programs and separate CHIP programs differently.", "For CHIP Medicaid expansion programs, when federal CHIP funding is exhausted, the CHIP-eligible children in these programs continue to be enrolled in Medicaid but financing switches from CHIP to Medicaid. For separate CHIP programs, states are provided a couple of exceptions to the MOE: (1) after September 1, 2015, states may enroll CHIP-eligible children into qualified health plans in the health insurance exchanges or (2) states may impose waiting lists or enrollment caps in order to limit CHIP expenditures. In addition, in the event that a state's CHIP allotment is insufficient to fund CHIP coverage for all eligible children, a state must establish procedures to screen children for Medicaid eligibility, and enroll those who are Medicaid-eligible. For children not eligible for Medicaid, the state must establish procedures to enroll CHIP children in qualified health plans in the health insurance exchanges that have been certified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to be \"at least comparable\" to CHIP in terms of benefits and cost sharing.", "Congress will face a decision with regard to the future of CHIP when federal CHIP funding expires after FY2017. If Congress does not act and federal CHIP funding ends, some CHIP enrollees likely would continue to have coverage through Medicaid as a result of the MOE requirements, but others would need to find another source of health insurance coverage (e.g., employer-sponsored health insurance or through the health insurance exchanges), and some likely would be uninsured.

Before CHIP was established, no federal program provided health coverage to children with family with annual incomes above Medicaid eligibility levels. The ACA further expanded the options for children in certain low-income families with incomes above CHIP eligibility levels by offering subsidized coverage for insurance purchased through health insurance exchanges.

FY2013 state-reported CHIP enrollment data (the most recent data available) show that the bulk of CHIP enrollees received coverage through separate CHIP programs (approximately 70%). The remainder received coverage through a CHIP Medicaid expansion. This enrollment distribution has largely held true over the course of the program's history (see Figure 1 below). However, this landscape likely will change due to modifications to CHIP eligibility rules enacted under the ACA.

(Hereinafter, targeted low-income children are referred to as CHIP children, CHIP-eligible or CHIP-enrolled, as applicable.)

Many states with CHIP Medicaid expansion programs chose the latter, opting to cover CHIP children under existing Medicaid eligibility pathways, especially Medicaid's poverty-related child groups, rather than by establishing the Title XXI of SSA optional coverage group.

However, prior to January 1, 2014, states were able to use income disregards, which effectively permitted states to expand eligibility to children under age 19 at whatever level they chose. Two states, New Jersey, and New York, plus one California county used this income-counting methodology to expand their CHIP programs to 355% FPL, 405% FPL, and 416% FPL, respectively. The income-disregard option was eliminated under the ACA. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CHIP Eligibility Changes Under the ACA", "paragraphs": ["Beginning January 1, 2014, the ACA required the federal government and states to rely on modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) income counting rules when determining eligibility for CHIP as well as most of Medicaid's nonelderly populations and subsidized exchange coverage. Under the MAGI rules, a state looks at each individual's MAGI, deducts 5% (which the law provides as a standard disregard), and compares that income to the new income standards set by each state. The transition to MAGI effectively limits CHIP upper income eligibility levels for states by eliminating a state's ability to use income disregards to extend coverage to children in families at higher income levels. Also under the ACA, states are permitted to use CHIP federal matching funds to cover children who lose Medicaid eligibility as a result of the elimination of income disregards. ", "As a part of a separate provision, the ACA required states to transition CHIP \"stairstep\" children aged 6 through 18 in families with annual income less than 133% FPL (based on MAGI) to Medicaid, beginning January 1, 2014. According to a recent Medicaid budget survey, 21 states transitioned children from CHIP to Medicaid in 2014 as a result of this requirement. Of the states impacted by this policy, another study estimates that on average 28% (or approximately 562,000 stairstep children) made this transition in January 2014. The purpose of this transition was to ensure uniform child coverage under Medicaid up to 133% FPL (effectively 138% after adjustment for the 5% disregard) across all states.", "The ACA also required states to maintain income eligibility levels for CHIP through September 30, 2019, as a condition for receiving payments under Medicaid (notwithstanding the lack of corresponding federal appropriations for FY2018 and FY2019).

(See Table 2 .) Families with higher income levels are more likely to have access to employer-sponsored insurance coverage. With the enactment of the ACA, families may also have access to subsidized coverage through the exchange. However, such coverage is not always affordable for low-income families. (For more information on the definition of affordability of employer-sponsored insurance coverage as it relates to a family's ability to qualify for subsidized exchange coverage, see the discussion of the \"family glitch issue\" in the subsection entitled \" The Future of CHIP .\") ", " Figure B-1 through Figure B-4 of Appendix B show the 50-state upper income eligibility levels for children and pregnant women in Medicaid, CHIP, and subsidized exchange coverage, as of January 1, 2014. Variability exists across states in the income eligibility ranges (i.e., income eligibility floors and ceilings) associated with each of the programs. The federal Medicaid statute establishes mandatory coverage floors (defined as a percentage of the federal poverty level) for its poverty-related pregnant women and children eligibility pathways. However, states are permitted to extend Medicaid coverage above these federal minimum levels; this is why there is variability across states in terms of the income eligibility levels at which CHIP begins. For example, the state of Alabama extends Medicaid eligibility to infants in families with annual income less than or equal to 141% FPL, while the state of Iowa extends Medicaid eligibility to infants in families with annual income less than or equal to 240% FPL. In another example, CHIP coverage for children extends to a higher income eligibility threshold than subsidized health insurance exchange coverage in one county in California and in the state of New York (i.e., 416% FPL and 405% FPL, respectively). ", "It is important to note, however, that not all children with family income at the specified levels are eligible for each of the programs due to program rules that differ for each of these programs. For instance, CHIP is only available to uninsured children, subsidized exchange coverage is not available to individuals with access to minimum essential coverage, and insurance status is not considered when determining Medicaid eligibility.", "These figures show both the range of CHIP income eligibility relative to the other programs, and how the programs are envisioned to work together in extending coverage to low-income children and families. CHIP in some states covers a relatively small segment of the income eligibility continuum while CHIP in other states covers a larger segment of the continuum. This is particularly true for infants and pregnant woman. States have used the optional Medicaid eligibility pathways to set higher Medicaid income eligibility levels for infants and pregnant women relative to older children (see Figure B-1 through Figure B-4 of Appendix B ). As a result, CHIP has been used to provide health coverage to older uninsured children to a greater extent. ", "In general, the Medicaid program is a much larger program than CHIP. Child enrollment in Medicaid, for example, was 38.7 million as compared to 8.1 million in CHIP in FY2013. The figures in Appendix B , however, are not weighted to reflect program enrollment by state. For example, it is possible that a state with a large uninsured child population but a CHIP program with a relatively narrow income eligibility range may result in a much larger number of CHIP program enrollees than a state with a relatively small uninsured child population and a CHIP program with a much broader income eligibility range."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Pregnant Women and Unborn Children", "paragraphs": ["Nineteen states provide coverage to pregnant women under CHIP.

The latter is the predominant pathway used by states for this purpose.", "As of January 2014, four states (Colorado, New Jersey, Oregon, and Rhode Island) extended coverage to pregnant women under Section 1115 waiver authority or the CHIP pregnant women state plan option.

Since the odd-year formula is based on states' actual use of CHIP funds, it is called the \"re-basing year\" because a state's CHIP allotment can either increase or decrease depending on each state's CHIP expenditures in the previous year.", "State CHIP allotment funds are available to states for two years.

The health insurance market is far different today, with the enactment of the ACA. Now, if CHIP funding is exhausted, current CHIP-eligible children potentially could be eligible for Medicaid, for subsidized coverage in the health insurance exchanges, or for their parent's employer-sponsored insurance coverage, but not all CHIP-eligible children would be eligible for these programs and some could end up being uninsured without the availability of CHIP. ", "Some argue that it is important to continue providing child-specific safety net coverage because each of the low-income subsidy programs (e.g., CHIP, Medicaid, and subsidized exchange coverage) plays a unique role in the health care delivery system. For instance, greater cost-sharing protections exist for the programs that target families at the lower ends of the income-eligibility spectrum. In addition, some are wary of providing coverage for children in the health insurance exchanges because the exchanges are new and there is little evidence about how coverage in the exchanges compares to CHIP coverage.", "With FY2017 being the final year for which federal CHIP funding is provided in statute, Congress's action or inaction will determine the future of CHIP and of health coverage for CHIP children.

The MOE requirements impact CHIP Medicaid expansion programs and separate CHIP programs differently.

This switch would cause the federal share of expenditures to decrease from the E-FMAP rate to the regular FMAP rate, which means the cost of covering these children would increase for states. For separate CHIP programs , states are provided a couple of exceptions to the MOE: (1) after September 1, 2015, states may enroll CHIP-eligible children into qualified health plans in the health insurance exchanges or (2) states may impose waiting lists or enrollment caps in order to limit CHIP expenditures. In addition, in the event that a state's CHIP allotment is insufficient to fund CHIP coverage for all eligible children, a state must establish procedures to screen children for Medicaid eligibility, and enroll those who are Medicaid-eligible. For children not eligible for Medicaid, the state must establish procedures to enroll CHIP children in qualified health plans in the health insurance exchanges that have been certified by the HHS Secretary.

Under the MOE, if states do not receive a CHIP allotment, after establishing procedures to enroll all Medicaid eligible children in Medicaid, states are only required to establish procedures to enroll children in qualified health plans certified by the HHS Secretary.

Although the specific results of coverage projections may look different in future years, it is possible to learn from the information they offer. In anticipation of the FY2015 congressional debate regarding the future of CHIP, the Urban Institute conducted an analysis for MACPAC to generate estimates of the sources of coverage for children in separate CHIP programs who were projected to lose CHIP coverage if federal CHIP funding was exhausted in FY2016. The analysis found that if federal CHIP funding was not renewed and states exhausted their FY2015 federal allotments, approximately two-thirds of current separate CHIP-enrolled children would move to their parent's employer-sponsored insurance coverage (i.e., approximately 1.2 million, or 32.6%) or to subsidized exchange coverage (i.e., approximately 1.4 million, or 36.5%). The remaining one-third of such children (approximately 1.1 million, or 30.9%) would become uninsured in FY2016.

With respect to benefit coverage, a recent MACPAC analysis of benefits available under separate CHIP programs, Medicaid, exchange plans, and employer-sponsored insurance found the following:", "Covered benefits vary within each source\u2014between states for Medicaid and CHIP and among plans for exchange plans and employer-sponsored insurance. Most CHIP, Medicaid, exchange plans, and employer-sponsored insurance plans cover major medical benefits, such as inpatient and outpatient care, physician services, and prescription drugs. Although Medicaid and CHIP cover pediatric dental services, dental benefits are offered as a separate, stand-alone insurance product in most exchanges. CHIP and Medicaid cover many services that are not always available in exchange plans. For example, all CHIP and Medicaid programs cover audiology exams, and 95% of CHIP programs cover hearing aids. However, only 37% of exchange plan essential health benefit benchmarks cover audiology exams, and only 54% cover hearing aids. For other benefits, such as applied behavioral analysis therapy and autism services, coverage varies.", "MACPAC's analysis of affordability of exchange coverage for children currently covered by CHIP found that the out-of-pocket costs for CHIP generally are higher than under Medicaid but significantly lower than in the exchanges or under employer-sponsored insurance. When comparing out-of-pocket costs across coverage types, MACPAC found that for families with employer-sponsored insurance, \"projected premiums could average $3,751 per year or 9.1% of family income. Families with subsidized coverage on the exchange might see smaller or no premium costs, but they would face much higher cost-sharing amounts (in the form of deductibles and service-level cost-sharing) than under CHIP.\"", "With respect to financing, under CHIP and Medicaid the coverage for CHIP enrollees would continue to be jointly financed by the federal government and states, but moving CHIP children into Medicaid would increase the state share of expenditures for these children. Under the option to move CHIP children into the health insurance exchanges, the federal government alone would fund the subsidized coverage, without any contribution from states. For employer-sponsored insurance coverage, premiums are largely shared by the employer and its employees. ", "Appendix A.
