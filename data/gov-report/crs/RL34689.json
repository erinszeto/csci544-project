{"id": "RL34689", "title": "Oil Industry Financial Performance and the Windfall Profits Tax", "released_date": "2011-07-13T00:00:00", "summary": ["Over the past 13 years, surging crude oil and petroleum product prices have increased oil and gas industry revenues and generated record profits, particularly for the top five major integrated companies, ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips. These companies, which reported a predominant share of those profits, generated more than $104 billion in profit on nearly $1.8 trillion of revenues in 2008, before declining as a result of the recession and other factors. From 2003 to 2008, revenues increased by 86%; net income (profits) increased by 66%. Oil output by the five major companies over this time period declined by more than 7%, from 9.85 million to 9.12 million barrels per day. In 2010 the companies' oil production was 9.4 million barrels per day. Being largely price-driven, with no accompanying increase in output resulting from increased investment in exploration and production, some believe that a portion of the increased oil industry income over this period represents a windfall and unearned gain. A windfall income is not earned as a result of additional production effort on the part of the firms, but due primarily to record crude oil prices, which are set in the world oil marketplace.", "Since the 109th Congress, numerous bills have been introduced seeking to impose a windfall profits tax (WPT) on oil. An excise-tax based WPT would tax only domestic production and, like the one in effect from 1980-1988, would increase marginal oil production costs. Theoretically, such a policy could reduce domestic oil supply, which could raise petroleum imports, making the United States more dependent on foreign oil, undermining goals of energy independence and energy security. By contrast, an income-tax based WPT would likely be more economically neutral (less economic distortion) in the short-run. Sizeable tax revenues could potentially be raised without reducing domestic oil supplies. Neither the excise-tax based nor income-tax based WPT are expected to have significant price effects. Neither tax would increase the price of crude oil, which means that refined petroleum product prices, such as pump prices for gasoline, would likely not increase.", "In lieu of these two types of WPT, an administratively simple way of increasing the tax burden on the oil industry, and therefore recouping some of any excess or windfall profits, particularly from major integrated producers, would be to raise the effective corporate tax rate. One option would be repealing or reducing the domestic manufacturing activities deduction under IRC \u00a7 199. The 112th Congress voted on this measure as part of the Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act (S. 940). Going forward, in the context of deficit reduction, the 112th Congress may continue evaluating various methods for increasing taxes on the oil and gas industry to address concerns surrounding possible windfall profits."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Over the past 13 years, the price of crude oil has generally been increasing and volatile. High crude oil prices, which have led to high gasoline prices, have contributed to a weakening of the U.S. economy. Further, high gasoline prices put increased pressure on household budgets, during a time when households continue to struggle with persistently high levels of unemployment and a flagging housing market. While much of the American economy has suffered as a result of high oil prices, those prices generated record profit levels for the oil industry. Five companies\u2014ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips\u2014earned a predominant share of those profits.", "Record oil and gas industry profits have raised the concern of many public policy experts and federal policymakers, including many in Congress, who have questioned whether these profits were justified, or whether they constituted a \"windfall\" to the industry: an excessive, unearned, and unfair gain. Important factors in considering this issue might include the ultimate source, or reason, for the price increases, and what the industry's role was in generating them, i.e., whether it was through the direct result of the industry's efforts, in terms of employing its resources, decision-making, or risk-taking, or whether it was the result of fortuitous factors and events. Also important to the public policy question might be the actual size of the profits and what the industry did with them. If an industry invests profits into increased production capacity, the increased supply may ultimately cause prices to fall and the profits to dissipate. As the analysis in this report shows, the experience between 2003 and the first quarter of 2011 suggests that investments in oil exploration and development have not managed to keep company oil output from declining from the peak attained in 2006.", "Numerous bills have been introduced in the Congress over this period to tax the oil and gas industry's record profits. Broadly, there are two ways that tax policy can be used to increase taxes on oil and gas profits. First, Congress could scale back or eliminate various tax incentives and preferences currently available to the industry. Second, Congress could directly increase taxes on the industry, through some form of an excess profits tax or windfall profits tax. ", "During the 1 st session of the 112 th Congress, the Senate considered a measure that would have eliminated various tax preferences for major integrated oil companies. A motion to proceed to consideration of the Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act ( S. 940 ) was rejected in May 2011. S. 940 sought to eliminate industry-specific incentives, such as the ability to partially expense intangible drilling costs (IDCs). Further, the legislation would have prevented major integrated oil companies from taking advantage of tax incentives available to firms operating in other industries, such as the domestic production activity deduction (the \u00a7 199 deduction).", "High crude oil prices and the associated profits may lead policymakers to look at the tax burden on the oil and gas industry broadly, shifting the focus beyond the major integrated oil companies. Since the inception of the federal income tax system in the early 20 th Century, the oil and gas industry has accrued sizable benefits (in excess of $190 billion, according to one estimate). While some of the traditional tax incentives, notably percentage depletion for integrated producers, have been significantly pared back over the years, some have argued that no tax incentives should be available to the industry at a time of high profits. ", "As was noted above, a second option for increasing taxes on oil and gas industry profits is to take a more direct approach. Congress could choose to impose a windfall or \"excess\" profits tax-a supplemental or additional tax on the oil industry-one based on windfall or excess profits in addition to other income or other taxes that the industry might pay. While some might envision this as a totally new type of tax on windfall gains, an alternative would be to model it after the windfall profits tax on oil that existed from 1980 to 1988. A windfall profit tax would be in addition to the current tax on corporate and business income that applies to the oil and gas industry, whose profits are taxed at rates as high as 35%.", "This report contains information useful in evaluating the windfall profits tax policy option. The first section analyzes the major oil companies profit performance, particularly from 2003 to 2010, both in terms of earnings and how those earnings have been used. The second section is a brief legislative history of windfall profit tax proposals and legislation in the 109 th through 112 th Congresses. The third section analyzes the concept of a windfall profits tax, including experiences with the tax of the 1980s, its viability, and potential role in the tax system and economy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Oil Industry Financial Performance", "paragraphs": ["During the 2000s, oil prices have been volatile, and generally rising.

During the fall/winter of 1998/1999, the spot market price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil was between $11 and $12 per barrel. By July 2003, it had risen to $30.75 per barrel. Five years later, in July 2008, the spot market price of WTI was $133.37, an increase of 334% in five years, and more than 1,000% over the 1998 price. In June 2008, the spot market price reached the all-time high of $147 per barrel. With the onset of the effects of the financial crisis and the recession, as well as a reaction to higher consumer gasoline prices, the price of WTI fell to $39 per barrel in February 2009. By the end of 2009 the price of WTI was almost $75 per barrel. During 2010, the price of WTI ranged between $73 and $90 per barrel. Unrest in the Middle East and North Africa brought the price of WTI back over $100 per barrel in April 2011.", "This 13-year period of generally increasing oil prices, punctuated by a major decline in 2008/2009, began after a poor year for profitability in the oil industry, 1998, and included another poor year, 2002, along with record profit years. The oil price increases that began in late 2003 seemed to be largely unanticipated by the industry. They have since been attributed primarily to (1) a growing world economy, particularly the emerging economies of China and India; (2)\u00a0declining excess production capacity, particularly within OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) producers; and (3) a number of financial factors, including futures market speculation, exchange rate, and inflation hedges. As the price of oil rose, company revenues, net incomes, and income taxes paid also rose, with ExxonMobil eventually becoming the most profitable corporation in the history of American industry.", "The oil industry is composed of thousands of companies, ranging from the major integrated oil companies with operations around the globe, to independent producers (which range in size from small to very large), to relatively small oil service and equipment companies. The increase in oil prices over the past 13 years\u2014particularly over the past five years\u2014has enhanced the profitability of virtually all sectors of the industry, directly or indirectly. This report highlights the financial performance of the industry's largest players, the major integrated oil companies. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Major Integrated Oil Companies", "paragraphs": ["While the oil and gas industry's high profitability has been widespread, it has also been concentrated among the industry's largest firms. Financial data show that the performance of the industry is dominated by the five largest firms: ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips. Generally, the net income of these five firms constituted 90% of the total net income of the nine firms considered to be integrated oil companies, at various times over the period, operating in the United States. ", "With the exception of 2009, revenues of the five major firms have increased annually since 2003 (see Table 1 ). Total revenue is measured as price times the quantity of goods and services sold. In the case of the five major oil companies over this period, the increase in revenues was largely price-driven, with quantities of oil produced largely stagnant. For example, in 2003, ExxonMobil produced 2.59 million barrels per day (b/d) of crude oil, and in 2010, ExxonMobil produced 2.42 million b/d, a decrease of about 3%. In general, the five major oil firms did not produce more crude oil and petroleum products in response to the incentive of higher prices. As illustrated in Table 2 , production of crude oil during the period was relatively stable. Only Chevron and BP produced more crude over this period, and, for the five firms as a whole, output declined by 4.5% from 2003-2010.", "Revenue data for the first half of 2011 reflects the sharp increases in the price of oil observed during the first four months of the year, with the price of WTI reaching $112 per barrel in April. For the first quarter of 2011, the five firms earned total revenues of $422 billion and net incomes of $32.3 billion. These values could result in yearly values approaching the results of 2008, assuming the price of oil remains near its peak.", "In recent years, trends in net income have also tended to follow trends in revenues and crude oil prices (see Table 3 ). While revenues increased by 86% from 2003 to 2008, net income increased by a greater percentage, on average 108%, except for ConocoPhillips, which can be considered as a special case in 2008. These percentages suggest that price increases for crude oil, which can be both a revenue and a cost for these firms, increased at a higher rate than other costs and taxes, yielding net income growth for the five major firms. Analogously to the observed increase in revenues, the increase in net income experienced by the five firms was largely price-driven.", "The measures of financial performance shown in Table 1 and Table 3 focus on absolute levels: absolute levels of revenue, and absolute net income. An additional measure of financial performance is the profit rate, which may also be measured in variety of ways. One measure of the profit rate is the profit margin, essentially net income divided by revenue. As a result of the increasing price of oil driving up both total revenues and net incomes, the return on revenue, or the profit rate performance, has been mixed for the major integrated oil companies, as shown in Table 4 . This indicator of industry performance does not appear excessive when compared to the profit rate in the manufacturing sector as a whole, which in 2007 had a profit rate of 8.9%. However, an additional measure of the relative profit rate is the rate of return on equity (ROE). Using this measure of profit rate, the oil and gas industry's ROE was, on average, greater than the ROE for the manufacturing sector generally. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the oil and gas industry earned a 27% ROE in 2006, down slightly from 2005, but more than 9 percentage points higher than the average ROE for all manufacturing companies. ", "For the entire 2000-2008 period, the oil and gas industry's ROE averaged 7 percentage points higher than manufacturing's ROE, while for the 1985-1999 period, the oil and gas industry's ROE was only 2 percentage points higher. However, in 2009 the oil and gas companies' ROE fell to 4%, below the manufacturing industry average. By these measures, the industry's recent high profits, measured both in absolute terms, and relative to ROE, suggest that high oil price volatility is a key factor in explaining profits in the oil industry.", "There are multiple ways to interpret the price, income, and production data presented above. The data on net income and oil production could be viewed as a characterization of a set of firms that were unable to respond to the market signal of higher price by increasing output as predicted by economic theory. As a result, their revenues and net incomes increased proportionately, possibly supporting the conclusion that those profits constituted a \"windfall,\" at least in the sense that they were not earned through output expansion or improvement, risk-taking, or investments leading to cost reductions in production. However, the data could also be taken to suggest that the major oil companies did not earn more net income relative to the value of their product than many other industries, and the value of their product was determined on a world market, beyond their control. From this point of view, oil was attaining only its fair market value.", "The net income data presented in Table 2 and Table 3 was earned across three sectors of the industry. Namely, these three sectors are upstream operations (the exploration and production of oil and natural gas), downstream operations (the refining, transportation, distribution, and marketing of petroleum products, including motor gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and other petroleum products), and chemicals and all other \"non-oil\" activities. Over time, the relative importance of these sectors may shift in terms of their potential to generate net income. For example, while downstream activities were strong in 2005 and 2006, they weakened from 2007 to 2009. In terms of general corporate income taxation, this cyclical pattern of change is likely to have little effect, since it is over-all corporate net revenues that form the tax base. In terms of possible windfall profit taxation, however, this cyclical pattern might be important, as it is net-income from crude oil ownership and production that is likely to have a windfall gain, or \"unearned\" income component."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use of Profits10", "paragraphs": ["Firms that earn returns in excess of the market rate of return tend to reinvest these returns.

While cash holdings declined in 2007, compared to 2006, this was the result of reduced balances at only one company, Chevron. The other four major oil companies continued to build their cash balances. Cash holdings for the five major companies rose to almost $65 billion in 2008 before falling to $38 billion in 2009. Higher revenues and net incomes in 2010 resulted in cash reserves rising to over $63 billion in 2010.", "Accumulating cash balances gives firms flexibility and positions them to take advantage of investment and other opportunities quickly. It is also likely that the rapid increase in the price of oil and profits from 2003 to 2010 exceeded corporate plans and strategies on how to use it, resulting in accumulating cash holdings. ", "Cash dividend payouts by the five major oil companies were over $36 billion in 2008 and $38 billion in 2009, increasing even though 2009 saw declining revenues and profits for the firms. Although dividends fell to about $31 billion in 2010, this reduction was largely due to a 73% fall in dividend payments by BP associated with the expense of the Macondo oil spill. The firms also paid out funds to investors in the form of stock buybacks.

Early in the 112 th Congress, the spot market price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil surpassed the $100/barrel mark. Should high crude oil prices be associated with increased industry profits, Congress may once again choose to consider windfall profits tax proposals. ", "A windfall profits tax can be viewed as a way to allow the government to share in financial gains, particularly when the financial gains are not the direct result of industry activities. Some proposals have suggested that the additional tax revenues be used to fund subsidies for low-income persons to offset the burden of high petroleum prices. Additional revenues could also be used for energy conservation programs, alternative and renewable fuels, or deficit reduction. Additional revenues generated through a windfall profits tax need not be dedicated to a specific purpose.

At the federal level, however, such taxes have been used sparingly\u2014being viewed as extraordinary measures, their use limited to wartime or other periods characterized by economic emergencies and instabilities such as hyper-inflations.

This type of gain is often due to factors outside of the control of the benefitting institution. Excess profits, on the other hand, are based on defining an acceptable profit, and attributing everything above that level as excessive. Defining the level of profits that constitute excess profits can be subjective. This difference might be illustrated with a hypothetical example. A firm might be so efficient that its above-average profitability (or returns) might be considered excessive, but not a windfall.

In theory, a profit maximizing firm would respond to this type of tax by reducing output and attempting to raise prices to offset the higher marginal production costs. However, in the case of domestic crude oil, the higher marginal cost cannot be shifted forward as a higher oil price, because oil is priced in the international (world) oil market. Oil producers would not be able to shift the tax forward as a higher oil selling price because the first purchaser (generally, the refiner) could merely substitute imported crude, which would be tax-exempt.

In 2009 testimony before the Senate Committee on Finance, Subcommittee on Energy, Natural Resources, and Infrastructure, Alan B.

The tax incentives under consideration were those presented in the President's FY2010 Budget Proposal, which included a repeal of the \u00a7 199 deduction, among other provisions. Similar proposals appear in the FY2011 and FY2012 budget proposals. Overall, Kruger's testimony suggested that the effect of removing existing tax incentives for oil and gas would have small market impacts. Treasury officials estimate that eliminating the \u00a7 199 deduction and other tax incentives for oil and gas would have little or no effect on the world supply of oil and world oil prices. Removing tax incentives for the oil and gas industry would be unlikely to result in significantly higher prices for consumers of refined petroleum products. Treasury officials also estimate the long-run effects on domestic production to be small.

Depending on how responsive consumers of gasoline are to changes in price, some of the reduction in tax liability may be shifted forward to consumers, resulting in lower gas prices for consumers. In the short-run, consumers are not very responsive to changes in prices (e.g., the short-run price elasticity of demand for gasoline is low). Given that consumer demand is not responsive to changes in gas prices in the short-run, refiners would be unlikely to reduce prices with a gas tax holiday. In the long-run, as consumers are better able to change their behavior to adapt to higher gas prices, refiners may use the savings associated with a gas tax holiday to reduce gas prices for consumers.
