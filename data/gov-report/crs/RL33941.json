Habitat loss has been a major reason for many decisions to add species to the list\u2014in this case, loss of Arctic sea ice. The listing itself was praised by some environmentalists, who nonetheless deplored interim protective regulations for the polar bear as being too weak. Other parties, who opposed the listing itself, argued that the science supporting listing was weak, but felt that the regulations mitigated some of the economic impacts of the listing.", "Congress is addressing the regulations. A provision in the 2009 omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 1105) would allow the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce to withdraw the regulations without any administrative steps, effectively eliminating the special rules that were promulgated for this species.", "Polar bears depend on Arctic sea ice, which most scientists acknowledge will be affected by climate change causing, at minimum, an earlier annual or seasonal thaw and a later freeze of coastal sea ice. Scientists generally agree that in recent decades, the observed extent of Arctic sea ice has declined significantly as the result of climate warming: annual ice break-up in many areas is occurring earlier and freeze-up later. Globally, less than one-third of the 19 known or recognized polar bear populations are declining, more than one-third are increasing or stable. For the remaining one-third there is insufficient data to estimate population trends. Two polar bear populations occur within U.S. jurisdiction. There is considerable uncertainty in estimates of polar bear population numbers and trends as well as in our understanding of polar bear habitat.", "Polar bears are affected by climate change, environmental contaminants, and subsistence and sport hunting. Arctic sea ice is experiencing a continuing decline that may not be reversed easily, and some models project that late summer (September) sea ice could even disappear completely by mid-century.

Polar bears are well adapted to the Arctic, where ice thickness can increase or decrease rapidly as well as differ significantly from year to year and between regions. Nineteen known or identified populations of polar bears are estimated to total 20,000 to 25,000 animals ( Figure 1 ). Two of these populations occur within U.S. jurisdiction\u2014the Southern Beaufort Sea population (shared about equally with Canada), estimated at 1,526 animals; and the Chukchi/Bering Seas population (shared with Russia), estimated at about 2,000 animals.", "Robust data on polar bear populations are difficult to obtain. Globally, less than one-third of the world's 19 polar bear populations are known to be declining, and more than one-third are increasing or stable. In the remaining third, data are insufficient to estimate population trends and their status has not been assessed. In the United States, the polar bear population shared with Canada in the Southern Beaufort Sea may be starting to decline. In the Chukchi Sea population, shared with the Russia, over-harvest on the Russian side is considered a problem. Elsewhere, studies suggest that polar bear numbers are declining in Western Hudson Bay; a multi-year study, following local reports of more bears being seen in the northern parts of the population range, will determine if the observed decline is the result of a change in distribution or an actual reduction in abundance. Simulations suggest that polar bear populations are also declining in Baffin Bay, Kane Basin, and Norwegian Bay. The status of polar bears in the Central Arctic Basin\u2014where there are transient bears that normally reside in other regional populations\u2014is unknown. Two of the most southerly polar bear populations, in Southern Hudson Bay and Davis Strait, show no evidence of population decline over the past two decades of decreasing sea ice.", "Much of what is known about the polar bear populations and habitat is confined to regions close to shore that have been studied during long summer days, with little known about what happens on drifting sea ice far from shore, especially in winter when there is little or no daylight. Some observers urge caution in interpreting studies of sea ice change that are based primarily on surveys of nearshore regions, rather than the drifting sea ice environment in the Central Arctic Basin, where ice may be thickest. While the Central Arctic Basin currently is marginal habitat for small numbers of transient bears from other populations, changing climate could cause this area to become more important as a refugium for polar bears."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Polar Bear Life Cycle", "paragraphs": ["The primary food of this large predator is the ringed seal ( Phoca hispida ). A polar bear may stalk a seal by waiting quietly for one to emerge from an opening in the ice that seals make to breathe or to climb out of the water to rest. Ringed seals have a circumpolar distribution and are associated with ice for birthing and molting in the spring. Much of ringed seal habitat (especially in offshore drifting sea ice) has not been surveyed, leading to much uncertainty regarding population size and status. Current estimates of the global population numbers for ringed seals range from 2 million to as many as 7 million animals. Other polar bear prey include bearded and harp seals, juvenile walrus, beluga whales, narwhal, fish, and seabirds and their eggs. Over most of their range, polar bears remain on the sea ice year-round or spend at most only short periods on land. In October and November, male polar bears, and females that are not pregnant, head out onto sea ice where they spend the winter.", "Pregnant females dig large dens in snow where they give birth and spend the winter. Females seek denning sites either on the sea ice (\"pelagic bears\") or on mainland areas (\"nearshore bears\"); some individuals seem to prefer mainland sites. Both pelagic and nearshore individuals are known in all subpopulations studied. Annual rates of population increase for polar bears may be as much as 5%, with mature females reproducing once every three years (commonly twins, more rarely triplets). Large carnivorous mammals are generally considered to be most at risk of population declines and extinctions, and the minimum viable total population of polar bears has been estimated at 4,961 adults."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Effects of Climate Change 17", "paragraphs": ["Climate change is widely considered one of the most significant contemporary threats to biodiversity worldwide. Studies by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) state that two-thirds of the world's polar bear population could be lost within 50 years. A May 2002 report by the World Wildlife Fund raised public concern that polar bear populations are threatened by climate change. Scientists have observed that, in recent decades, the extent of Arctic sea ice has declined significantly, and indicate that the reduction results from climate warming: annual ice break-up in many areas is occurring earlier and freeze-up later. Arctic sea ice is experiencing a continuing decline that, it is thought, may not easily be reversed, and some models project that Arctic late summer (September) sea ice could disappear completely by mid-century. In an analysis of climate models in light of Arctic ice conditions and polar bear impacts, USGS addressed the uncertainties in the models, but stated:", "Climate model simulations are in universal accord that greenhouse gas increases will cause Arctic sea ice cover to decline, with the greatest reductions occurring at the end of the summer melt season.... A further consistency in climate simulations is the uneven latitudinal distribution of global warming, which always has its greatest simulated impact in the high northern latitudes. This \"polar amplification\" and associated sea ice decline have been consistent climate simulation features at least since the early simulation of Manabe and Souffer (1980). Since Chapman and Walsh (1993), declines in Arctic sea ice, with the largest trends in September, have also been consistently reported in observations.... ", "However, links between climate-model predictions and threats to polar bears are characterized as tenuous by many scientists, who point to the limitations of correlational studies and the hypothetical nature of model-based predictions of environmental conditions decades into the future.", "Distribution patterns of some polar bear populations have changed in recent years. Greater numbers of bears are being found onshore near the Bering Sea, and in some parts of Canada, with Inuit hunters reporting more bears present on land during summer and fall. There may be several reasons for the observed changes, including changes in sea ice; those who conduct population censuses of polar bears will need to be cautious in interpreting whether apparent population variations are indicative of changing habitat use (e.g., greater numbers of bears onshore) or actual changes in population abundance. Recent studies found that mid-latitude European populations of Arctic fox became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene and did not track the habitat when it shifted to the north, suggesting that some populations of Arctic species are unable to track decreases in habitat availability and may be vulnerable to increases in global temperatures.", "A loss of sea ice could affect survival and reproduction of polar bears by:", "shortening the season during which ice is available to serve as a platform for hunting ringed seals; increasing the distance between the ice edge and land, thereby making it more difficult for nearshore female bears that prefer to den on land to reach preferred denning areas; reducing the availability of sea ice dens for gestating pelagic female bears; requiring nearshore bears to travel through fragmented sea ice and open water, which uses more energy than walking across stable ice formations; reducing the availability and accessibility of ice-dependent prey, such as ringed seals, to nearshore populations; and requiring nearshore bears to spend more time on land, thereby increasing the potential for adverse human-polar bear interactions.", "In addition to changing sea ice conditions, others have expressed concern that climate change could affect the integrity of polar bear den sites, as rain can destroy ice dens, exposing young polar bears to the elements prematurely.", "Although some scientists predict the extinction of polar bears under potential climate change scenarios, not all sea-ice changes would harm polar bears. For example, reduced sea ice thickness and coverage in far northern regions could improve polar bear habitat, by increasing the availability and accessibility of ice-dependent prey, such as ringed seals.

Moreover, climate change may alter contaminant pathways through increased precipitation, increasing the potential threat to polar bears. Polar bears are particularly vulnerable to oil spills, because oil damages polar bear fur (decreasing the bears' ability to thermoregulate) and because of oil ingestion (poisoning) via grooming and/or eating contaminated prey. Although elevated concentrations of some persistent organic pollutants have been discovered in polar bears, it has been difficult to determine what biological effects these chemicals might have on polar bears; weakened immune systems and reduced reproductive success are among the concerns. Some persistent organic pollutants are endocrine disruptors and are thought to cause pseudo-hermaphrodism and aberrant genital morphology in polar bears. Mercury is a particular concern because of its toxicity at low concentration, and its magnification and accumulation through the food web. However, polar bears appear able to demethylate (i.e., alter the chemical form and biological reactivity of) mercury and accumulate somewhat elevated levels of mercury without harm."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Subsistence and Sport Harvest", "paragraphs": ["The United States allows limited subsistence harvest of polar bears by Alaska Natives.

This harvest level is close to or greater than the harvest levels during the sport hunting era prior to 1972 (approximately 178 bears/year).", "There is particular concern for the Chukchi/Bering Seas population due to anecdotal evidence that unregulated harvest by Russian Natives on the Chukotka Peninsula may be reaching unsustainable levels.", "Some have suggested that habitat alteration from climate change may interact with subsistence and sport harvest to increase polar bear mortality. For example, they believe that large adult male bears, more likely to be targeted by hunters, could also be more at risk from the effect of climate change on prey availability since larger bears require greater amounts of food. Others counter that habitat conditions and prey availability for polar bears could improve as climate warms as a result of increased marine productivity in regions currently dominated by multi-year ice. Also, male bears represent a threat to cubs and juvenile bears. Consequently, any factor\u2014such as sport and subsistence hunting (which often target adult males)\u2014that reduces the population of adult males, may increase cub and juvenile survivorship and therefore may exert a positive influence should bears become nutritionally challenged in the future."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Canadian Non-Resident Sport Harvest45", "paragraphs": ["Some argue that a well-regulated sport harvest, managed for conservation of the population, can provide strong incentives to conserve a species, and cite waterfowl conservation as an example of the beneficial effects of sport hunting.

Some of the regional polar bear populations in Nunavut and NWT are shared with other jurisdictions; harvest sharing is undertaken through inter-jurisdictional meetings and awareness of neighbors' hunting needs.

These programs, through carefully controlled sport hunting, can play a role in providing incentives to conserve a species, as well as funding conservation programs for the hunted species and its habitat. Before polar bears were listed under ESA, a provision of the MMPA allowed the importation of sport trophy polar bear artifacts and skins from regulated hunts in Canada. However, an ESA listing as \"threatened\" triggers an automatic designation as a \"depleted\" species under the MMPA, and therefore prevents U.S. citizens from importing polar bear products into the United States, due to a violation of the MMPA. Such an import ban, effectively stopping U.S. participation in the Canadian conservation-based hunting programs, would, according to some observers, end the financial assistance derived from the sport hunt, possibly reduce community support for a sustainable harvest, and perhaps compromise successful community-based conservation programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Economic Impacts", "paragraphs": ["The NWT and Nunavut governments charge non-resident hunters (i.e., U.S. or other non-Canadian resident) a Can$750 trophy fee plus a Can$50 tag fee.

In discussing the breadth of the consultation requirement vis-a-vis emission of GHGs, the final special rule states that the need for a causal connection between the federal action and an effect on polar bears \"narrows section 7 consultation requirements to listed species in the 'action area' rather than to all listed species.\" This interpretation, according to the special rule, avoids the possibility that every agency action that would produce greenhouse gases would result in consultation.", "While this provision in the final special rule could limit the number of consultations regarding polar bears, it is less clear that it would limit their breadth. For example, if an agency were issuing permits relating to emissions of GHG at a specific site, the rule's discussion states", "There is currently no way to determine how the emissions from a specific action both influence climate change and then subsequently affect specific listed species, including polar bears. As we now understand them, the best scientific data currently available do not draw a causal connection between GHG emissions resulting from a specific Federal action and effects on listed species or critical habitat by climate change.", "The rule suggests that the action agency need not consult on the permit on the grounds that the causal link between the agency's action and an effect on polar bears is too weak. However, if the agency were developing regulations that applied to emissions for all such sites or emitters, one might argue that implementation of the regulations \"may affect\" polar bears and their habitat. Consultation would appear to be necessary in that case, since the causal link between regulations for all of the permitted GHG emissions and effects on polar bears might be stronger.", "In addition, while the causal connection between emissions of a single GHG source and polar bear habitat loss is currently tenuous or de minimis , according to \"the best scientific data currently available,\" what might happen if scientific analysis and improved data were to make that causal chain stronger?

The 90-day finding was published February 9, 2006, and pursuant to an agreement reached by CBD and FWS, the 12-month finding was published January 9, 2007. Another lawsuit was filed in January 2008 when the one-year deadline for a final listing determination passed.

The 60-day notice requirement is to allow the agency to correct any omission prior to going to court or to show that it is already diligently prosecuting the violation. The citizen suit provision allows any person to seek an injunction against a person or the United States to stop a violation of the act, and allows suits against FWS or NMFS specifically for those actions that are non-discretionary, such as missed deadlines.

However, some critics suggest that listing polar bears as threatened is premature, with this species being used as a \"poster child\" for the evils of climate change by the popular press in recognition of polar bears' charismatic appeal. Some believe that other species, such as the less-glamorous walrus, could be facing similar or greater immediate risk.", "Some scientists also point out that, since polar bears have survived at least two major warming periods over the last 10,000 years, including the intense warming event that ended the Last Glacial Maximum about 8,000 to 9,000 years ago (when temperatures were believed to have been much warmer than now), polar bears and other Arctic mammals could be capable of adjusting, adapting, and coping with the current climatic change. At the end of the last Ice Age, the Northern Hemisphere entered an extended period of rapid warming, with temperatures in Arctic regions eventually reaching levels several degrees warmer than today. At that time, the sea ice above North America is known to have retreated substantially, allowing Arctic species such as bowhead whales and walrus to move northward into areas of the Canadian Arctic that they cannot reach today. The Mid-Holocene Warm Period peaked about 11,000-9,000 years ago near Alaska and about 8,000-5,000 years ago near Greenland and Northern Europe.
