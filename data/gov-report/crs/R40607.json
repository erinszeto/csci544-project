While patents may provide incentives for innovation, their granting of market exclusivities and impact on prices raise questions about the affordability of medicines, particularly for (but not limited to) low-income countries and their populations. Through their possible impact on innovation and drug prices, patents may affect the ability of countries to provide medicines to their populations and for populations in general to access medicines. For some observers, this may represent a conflict between free market and public health policies. While the commercialization of public health may promote innovation and efficiency, the laws of supply and demand may cause some people to be \"priced out\" of a given market.", "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about one-third of the world's population, primarily residing in poorer parts of Africa and Asia, lacks regular access to essential medicines. Infectious diseases are major contributors of illness, death, and poverty in the developing world. At the end of 2008, an estimated 33.4 million people were living with HIV/AIDS, with about two-thirds of them in Sub-Saharan Africa. Other infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, malaria, and influenza, present critical global health challenges as well.

While prevention is key to combating infectious diseases, access to treatment is also critical to controlling epidemics. As such, another MDG target is to cooperate with pharmaceutical companies to provide access to affordable essential drugs in developing countries. Access to medicines has improved dramatically over the past couple of decades. For example, of the approximately 9.5 million people in need of treatment for HIV/AIDS in 2008 in low- and middle-income countries, 42% had access, compared to 33% in 2007.", "Although access to medicines is an important goal and is the focus of the discussion at hand, some public health professionals caution that \"over-access\" also can be a problem.

Patents are the most common way for governments to encourage R&D and to foster innovation. A patent is a time-limited, legal, exclusive right granted for the invention of new products, processes, organisms, designs, and plants that allows the right holder to exclude others from making, using, or selling the protected invention for a period of 20 years. A patent does not necessarily provide the right holder with the \"right to sell\" the protected invention, as the right holder may need to comply with other regulatory laws. For example, pharmaceutical drugs generally also must be reviewed by a regulatory body (in the case of the United States, the Food and Drug Administration, FDA) for other considerations, such as health and safety, before it may be sold to consumers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Incentives for Innovation", "paragraphs": ["By granting time-limited, exclusive monopolies on the market for a product, patents generate above-market financial returns that are believed to enable pharmaceutical inventors to recoup the costs of R&D and to invest in future innovations.

Some critics argue that PhRMA's cost estimate includes both the actual expenditures and the economic opportunity costs of developing new drugs. They also contend that a growing proportion of the financial returns generated from patented drugs is not directed toward new innovations, but rather to commercial marketing and political lobbying activities.", "Additionally, pharmaceutical companies often use publicly-funded research to develop drugs for commercialization. For instance, in the United States, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) provide funding for health-related research.

Many developing countries may be unable to provide a profitable market for treatments against diseases that disproportionately affect their populations. The WHO \"Global Strategy and Plan of Action of Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property\" acknowledges that IPRs serve an important incentive function, but notes, \"This incentive alone does not meet the need for the development of new products to fight diseases where the potential paying market is small or uncertain (WHA61.21.6).\"", "According to a classification system used by the WHO, there are three main types of diseases that vary in the level of market-based incentives they offer for R&D.", "Type I diseases (\"chronic diseases\"), such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, are prevalent in developed countries and increasingly in developing countries. Pharmaceutical companies have a strong financial incentive to invest in treatments for these diseases. Type II diseases are prevalent in developing countries. Pharmaceutical companies may have incentives to invest in such diseases if there is sufficient demand by high-income countries for research, as in the case of HIV/AIDS. For other Type II diseases, such as malaria and tuberculosis, high-income country demand for treatments is limited and consequently, market-based incentives are not sufficient for pharmaceutical companies to invest in R&D. Type III diseases, such as dengue fever and African sleeping sickness, are those that have virtually no developed country demand. These diseases (often referred to as \"neglected tropical diseases\"), largely are concentrated in impoverished areas in developing countries. Pharmaceutical companies have little financial incentive to invest in R&D for these diseases, but may have social motivations. According to one commonly cited statistic, less than 10% of global expenditures on health research and development is directed toward the major health problems of 90% of the world's population (the so-called \"10/90 gap\"). Some point out that low rates of R&D investment in \"developing country diseases\" may be one of many factors affecting health conditions in impoverished areas. For instance, some neglected tropical diseases are prevalent due to poverty-related conditions such as unsafe water, poor sanitation, and lack of basic health care infrastructure.", "Some of the pharmaceutical needs of developed and developing countries are increasingly converging. For example, many Type I diseases, typically associated with high-income countries (\"age\" diseases), also now account for a growing share of the disease burden in developing countries as they experience economic growth and development. The WHO estimates that 80% of the burden of chronic diseases is concentrated in low- and middle-income countries. Additionally, increasing outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as the H5N1 \"avian influenza\" and H1N1 \"swine influenza,\" and growing resistance to highly infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, may lead to R&D for diseases that affect all populations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Drug Pricing", "paragraphs": ["Pharmaceutical patents are among the many factors that may affect the price of medicines.

In general, generic manufacturers do not have to repeat research and clinical trials conducted by name brand pharmaceutical companies in order to obtain regulatory approval, but rather only need to demonstrate the \"bioequivalence\" of their product to the patented, branded medicine. In the United States, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Restoration Act of 1984 (the \"Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984\"), among other provisions, permits the FDA to provide marketing approval for generics on the basis of \"bioequivalence\" data rather than more costly, clinical data. Without this obligation, generic manufacturers are able to enter the market more quickly once patents have expired and to offer the drugs at lower prices.", "By serving as market competitors, generics also encourage innovator pharmaceutical companies to lower the prices of their branded drugs.

They are selected with due regard to public health relevance, evidence on efficacy and safety, and comparative cost-effectiveness. Essential medicines are intended to be available within the context of functioning health systems at all times in adequate amounts, in the appropriate dosage forms, with assured quality and adequate information, and at a price the individual and the community can afford. The implementation of the concept of essential medicines is intended to be flexible and adaptable to many different situations; exactly which medicines are regarded as essential remains a national responsibility.", "For low-income countries and populations, pharmaceutical drug prices may constitute a significant barrier in accessing essential and other medicines. In most parts of the world, health services are offered through a combination of public and private health services. Oftentimes, in developing countries (and in some cases, developed countries such as the United States), consumers bear much of their health care costs directly. In contrast, some countries, such as Thailand, Japan, Turkey, and France, have more publicly-funded pharmaceutical markets, reducing the costs borne by consumers. However, in situations where the government is funding a larger share of health care, higher-priced drugs may add limits to the government's ability to provide public health care.", "There is considerable debate on the extent to which patent protection affects access to essential medicines. The complexity is fueled by differing definitions of what is meant by \"essential medicines\" and \"access to medicines.\" For instance, there often are no agreed-upon units of analysis for evaluating access to essential medicines. Since 1977, the WHO has maintained a Model Essential Medicines List (EML) to assist national governments to select medicines to address their public health needs and to develop national lists. While the WHO EML often is used as a basis for analysis, some global health activists express concern that the EML may not be comprehensive. They argue that the EML may exclude essential medicines based on cost concerns. They contend that patents raise the cost of medicines, and that the EML includes very few medicines currently under patent. However, the EML notes that cost is not a reason to automatically exclude a medicine and points out that multiple criteria are considered in the decision process.", "Moreover, some argue that the number of essential medicines under patent is under \"constant flux\" because patents will expire for existing medicines, new patents will be sought for new medicines, new medicines will be added to the WHO's Model Essential Medicines List, and others will be removed from the EML."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "International Trade in Pharmaceuticals", "paragraphs": ["Like many other IPR-sensitive industries, the pharmaceutical industry is heavily involved in international trade.

Indonesia expressed concerns that the vaccines would be patented and then offered for purchase at marked-up prices unaffordable for Indonesia and other developing countries. In March 2007, Indonesia began sharing virus samples again under the condition that an international agreement would be negotiated for more equitable, affordable sharing of vaccines.
