These agencies are the Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture, and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and National Park Service (NPS), all within the Department of the Interior (DOI). In total, the law contained $2.50 billion for these agencies. The agencies received different amounts of this total: $320.0 million for BLM, $280.0 million for FWS, $750.0 million for NPS, and $1,150.0 million for FS. These appropriations represented varying percentages of each agency's FY2009 regular annual appropriation, ranging from about a fifth to a third of the total appropriation: 31% for BLM, 19% for FWS, 30% for NPS, and 24% for FS. The economic stimulus law did not provide geographic requirements for how the funds for these agencies were to be allocated, which is consistent with past practice.

Four federal agencies\u2014FS, BLM, FWS, and NPS\u2014manage about 615 million acres (94%) of this land. These agencies manage lands for a variety of purposes, primarily related to preservation, recreation, and development of natural resources. There are similarities among the agencies, but each agency has a distinct mission and special responsibilities for the lands under its jurisdiction. The NPS administers the National Park System for recreational use of parklands and preservation of park resources. The FWS manages wildlife refuges primarily for conserving plants and animals, with other uses to the extent that they are compatible. The BLM manages the National System of Public Lands, and the FS manages the National Forest System, for sustained yields of similar multiple uses for both agencies, including grazing, recreation, timber, water, and fish and wildlife. Many forests and public lands also are available for mineral exploration and development.", "Funding for the four federal land management agencies is provided in the annual appropriations laws for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies.

Among the general provisions, the law provided emergency funding for FY2009, with the monies available for obligation until September 30, 2010 (the end of FY2010) unless otherwise specified. The appropriations provisions in the law for the land management agencies did not specify different periods of obligation. In comparison, in the FY2009 regular annual appropriations law, many of the land management accounts that were funded by P.L. 111-5 received appropriations that would remain available until expended; other accounts received appropriations that were available for only one or two fiscal years. The economic stimulus law also stated that it shall have no effect on the availability of funds under the FY2009 continuing appropriations resolution ( P.L. 110-329 , Division A), and that appropriations are in addition to amounts otherwise appropriated for the fiscal year involved. ", "Under general provisions in P.L. 111-5 , agencies are to begin activities and spending the funds \"as quickly as possible consistent with prudent management.\" With regard to funds for infrastructure, recipients are to give preference to activities \"that can be started and completed expeditiously,\" with a goal of using at least 50% of the monies for activities that can be started within 120 days of enactment. ", "The law required that each agency receiving funding in the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies title is to notify the House and Senate Appropriations Committees as to how the monies are to be spent. Specifically, it provided that each such agency is to submit to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, within 30 days of enactment, a general plan for the expenditure of the funds. Each agency also is to submit to the committees, within 90 days of enactment, a report \"containing detailed project level information associated with the general plan.\" ", "The law authorized each agency receiving funding in the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies title to transfer up to 10% of the funds in any account to other accounts within the agency, if certain conditions were met. The conditions are that the agency head \"determines that the transfer will enhance the efficiency or effectiveness of the use of the funds without changing the intended purpose,\" and notifies the House and Senate Appropriations Committees \"10 days prior to the transfer.\" The original House-passed version of H.R. 1 had contained different language allowing for transfer of some of the appropriations among accounts. For example, for each construction account, the House-passed version had provided that the funds could be transferred to the main resource account of the respective agency; however, the BLM language allowed for transfer to \"other appropriate accounts.\" ", "The House-passed version of H.R. 1 had identified a certain percentage of each appropriation that could be used for program management and oversight. In general, the House provision had provided that up to 0.5% of each appropriation in the bill may be used for management and oversight of the programs, grants, and activities funded by the appropriation, unless other provision is made in the act. This provision was not included in P.L. 111-5 for appropriations generally. Specifically for the land management agencies, the House-passed language for each appropriation provided that not more than 5% of the appropriation shall be used for program management and oversight. This provision also was not included in the measure as enacted. However, the conferees on the bill expressed that funds for administrative and support costs of activities funded in the Interior title are not to exceed 5% of any specific appropriation, unless otherwise specified. They further cautioned agencies against permanent increases to their staff levels in favor of temporary, term, or contract personnel to handle the increased workload resulting from the additional funds provided in the law. ", "The balance of this report discusses the particular appropriations provided by P.L. 111-5 for the land management agencies as well as related issues. Funds are provided in the law for three primary purposes: construction, resource management, and wildland fire management. The original House-passed version of H.R. 1 had included funds for the NPS Centennial Challenge, which also is covered below. As shown in Table 1 and discussed in the remainder of this report, there were a number of significant differences between the original House- and Senate-passed bills, regarding both the composition of funding (i.e., activities to be funded) and the appropriations levels provided.

With regard to the individual agencies, the law provided relatively large increases for construction over the regular annual appropriations for FY2009; the FY2009 regular appropriations totaled $6.6 million for BLM, $35.5 million for FWS, $232.5 million for NPS, and $482.4 million for FS. ", "The construction total in the law, and its appropriation for each of the four agencies, were nearly identical to the appropriations contained in the original Senate-passed version of H.R. 1 .

In some cases these purposes and activities appear to be broader than has traditionally been the case. For instance, both the NPS and FS construction accounts identified remediation of abandoned mine sites. The largest abandoned mine land program addresses abandoned coal mining sites and is administered by the Office of Surface Mining (in DOI). Both the NPS and the FS have abandoned mine land programs as well. These programs are smaller in scale and are targeted to remediation of abandoned mining sites located on NPS and FS lands.

The conferees encouraged the agencies to give priority to projects based on their capacity \"to create the largest number of jobs in the shortest period of time and which creates lasting value\" for the public. In some cases the explanatory language identified purposes of the funds beyond those identified in the law. For instance, deferred maintenance was identified for all agencies other than the NPS, although \"critical infrastructure projects\" were included in the enacted language for the NPS.

Of the total deferred maintenance, 56% was for roads, bridges, and trails; 16% was for buildings; and 28% was for irrigation, dams, and other structures.", "DOI estimates of the NPS backlog have increased over the past decade from $4.25 billion in FY1999 to $10.17 billion for FY2008 (based on mid-range estimates). It is unclear what portion of the change is due to the addition of maintenance work that was not done on time or the availability of more precise estimates of the backlog. The NPS, as well as the other land management agencies, has enhanced efforts to define and quantify maintenance needs in recent years. Further, it is unclear how much total funding has been provided for backlogged maintenance over this 10-year period. Annual presidential budget requests and appropriations laws typically do not specify funds for backlogged maintenance, but instead combine funding for all NPS construction, facility operation, and regular and deferred maintenance.", "While congressional and administrative attention has centered on the NPS backlog, the other federal land management agencies also have maintenance backlogs. The FS estimated its backlog for FY2008 at $5.15 billion. Of the total deferred maintenance, $3.40 billion (66%) was for roads. Also for FY2008, DOI estimated the FWS backlog at between $2.26 billion and $3.32 billion and the BLM backlog at between $0.42 billion and $0.52 billion. The four agencies together had a combined FY2008 backlog estimated at between $16.06 billion and $21.09 billion, with a mid-range figure of $18.57 billion. ", "The NPS and the other agency backlogs have been attributed to decades of funding shortfalls. The agencies assert that continuing to defer maintenance of facilities accelerates their rate of deterioration, increases their repair costs, and decreases their value.
