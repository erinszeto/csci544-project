Over time, high commodity prices, changing land rental rates, and new conservation technologies have led to a shift in farm bill conservation policy away from the more traditional land retirement programs toward an increased focus on conservation working lands programs.

Since the 1996 farm bill, the number and size of conservation programs receiving mandatory funding has continued to grow. Currently the level of mandatory spending for conservation is roughly five times that of discretionary spending for conservation. For more than a decade, appropriators have placed limits on mandatory spending authorized in the farm bill, including a number of conservation programs. These limits are also known as CHIMPS, \"changes in mandatory program spending.\" Many of these mandatory programs usually are not part of the appropriations process since funding is authorized in the farm bill for a specific time period (FY2014-FY2018) and is assumed to be available based on the statute and without further congressional action. Most of these conservation spending reductions, however, were at the request of both the Bush and Obama Administrations. The mix of programs and amount of reduction has varied from year to year. Some programs, such as CRP, have not been reduced by appropriators in recent years, while others, such as EQIP, have been repeatedly reduced below authorized levels.

Under wetlands conservation, compliance violators have the option of mitigating the violation through the restoration of a converted wetland, the enhancement of an existing wetland, or the creation of a new wetland. Debate over these wetland mitigation requirements arose during the 2014 farm bill and centered on the concern that some producers were required to mitigate wetlands with a greater than 1-to-1 acreage ratio. This is allowed by statute if \"more acreage is needed to provide equivalent functions and values that will be lost as a result of the wetland conversion to be mitigated.\" The House-passed farm bill would have limited wetland mitigation to not more than a 1-to-1 acreage ratio. The Senate-passed farm bill would have required a study to assess the use of wetland mitigation, determine impacts on wildlife habitat, and provide recommendations for improving wetland mitigation procedures. Ultimately, the conference agreement adopted neither the House nor Senate provision and instead provided $10 million in mandatory funding for mitigation banking efforts. While the provision remains unchanged in statute, the conference report ( H.Rept. 113-333 ) includes language encouraging USDA to use a wetland mitigation ratio not to exceed 1-to-1 acreage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sodsaver", "paragraphs": ["The 2008 farm bill created a compliance provision under the Crop Insurance title, known as sodsaver. The sodsaver provision would have made producers who planted crops (five or more acres) on native sod ineligible for crop insurance and the noninsured crop disaster assistance (NAP) program for the first five years of planting. The 2008 farm bill limited the provision to virgin prairie converted to cropland in the Prairie Pothole National Priority Area, but only if elected by the state. Ultimately no governors opted to participate in the program and sodsaver was never activated.", "The Crop Insurance title (Title XI) of the 2014 farm bill amended and expanded the sodsaver provision. Unlike the 2008 sodsaver provision, there is no opt-in requirement and the provision became effective upon enactment. The sodsaver provision also applies to native sod in six states\u2014Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Nebraska\u2014rather than only the area covered by the Prairie Pothole National Priority Area. Crop insurance premium subsidies will now be reduced by 50 percentage points for production on native sod during the first four years of planting. Crops planted on native sod will have reduced benefits under NAP. The farm bill also clarified that native sod may include land that has never been tilled or cases where the producer cannot substantiate that the ground has ever been tilled.", "Crop yield guarantees might also be affected for crop insurance policies. The yield guarantee for a crop insurance policy is a producer's \"normal\" crop yield based on actual production history (APH). In the absence of actual yield data (e.g., production on native sod or no yield documentation on existing fields), a \"transition yield\" (T-yield) is assigned, which is based on a portion of 10-year average county yields for the crop. The 2014 farm bill sets the T-yield factor on native sod equal to 65% of the 10-year average county yield for production on native sod. For other cropland, the percentage can be higher depending on the number of years of actual data included in the APH. Also, \"yield substitution\" is not allowed; that is, low farm yields must be used in the APH rather than replacing them with potentially higher T-yields as allowed for other cropland. This is expected to reduce the incentive to produce on native sod."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
