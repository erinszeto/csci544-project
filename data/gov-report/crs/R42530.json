Despite the rise in foreign student enrollment, the percentage of STEM graduate students with temporary visas in 2009 (32.7%) was comparable to 1990 (31.1%).

In total, foreign nationals reporting STEM occupations made up 44% of all of the 676,642 LPRs who were employment-based principal immigrants during the decade of FY2000-FY2009. Of all of the LPRs reporting STEM occupations (297,668) over this decade, 52% entered as professional and skilled workers.

Concerns that these educational and career opportunities foster a \"brain drain\" of professionals from developing nations are infrequently expressed in the current debate. Instead, some researchers warn of a \"reverse brain drain\" because the United States does not allocate what they consider to be a sufficient number of visas for high-skilled immigrants to fuel the economy. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, \"growth in STEM jobs was three times as fast as growth in non-STEM jobs\" over the past 10 years.

They express concern that foreign nationals would displace U.S. residents in the STEM fields if additional visas were allocated. Some analysts observe that the only high-skilled occupations that experienced negative wage growth in recent years were technology-related occupations (e.g., computer programmers and engineers)\u2014occupations in which highly-educated foreign nationals cluster.

As Figure 9 shows, the NFAP projected further that countries other than India and China would have wait times for a third preference of four to six years. Anderson concluded \"America would lose much talent as U.S.-based businesses would need to hire or place such skilled individuals abroad, rather than invest in a green card process likely to last decades.\"", "The NFAP study indicates that foreign nationals holding advanced degrees (second preference) face far shorter wait times. Only India and China are mentioned as having a noteworthy number of second preference cases pending.

For those graduating five years earlier, the stay rate was down slightly from that recorded two years ago. However, for those graduating 10 years earlier, the stay rate in 2009 reached an all-time high. Finn concluded that stay rates for temporary foreign nationals receiving science and engineering doctorates overall have never been higher. ", "Finn also studied prospective immigrants from India and China, and he reached this conclusion: ", "China and India are countries of special interest because they account for a large and growing share of new doctorate recipients and are subject to some restrictions not faced by most other countries when seeking permanent resident status. When comparing the history of stay rates for these two countries with that of all other countries, however, there is no apparent evidence that visa restrictions have reduced stay rates for China and India.", "At first glance, it seems difficult to reconcile Finn's conclusion about prospective LPRs from China and India with Anderson's estimates of how long prospective LPRs from China and India might wait before visas would be available for them. From Anderson's perspective, the wait times are too long for prospective employment-based immigrants in the professional and skilled category.

To support this argument, they point out that the unemployment rate of 5.2% for computer and mathematical occupations was greater than the 4.7% unemployment rate of college graduates generally in 2010, and that the unemployment rate of chemists and material scientists reached its highest level in 40 years in 2011 (6.1%). Earlier research from 2007 found that STEM shortages were either overstated or misunderstood. One scholar testified about research indicating that some employers already use high-skilled temporary visa categories to recruit foreign workers at below market rates. This researcher also argued that employers have undue control over the temporary foreign workers because their legal status hinges on their employment. One study found that universities in the United States actually graduate many more STEM students than are hired each year.
