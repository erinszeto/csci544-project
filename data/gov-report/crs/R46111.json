States design and administer their Medicaid programs based on broad federal guidelines. The federal government requires states to cover certain mandatory populations and services but allows states to cover other optional populations and services. In addition, several waiver and demonstration authorities in statute allow states to operate their Medicaid programs outside of certain federal rules. Due to this flexibility, factors such as eligibility, covered benefits, and provider payment rates vary substantially by state.

Specifically, this report examines the statutory provisions that provide Medicaid eligibility for individuals who are considered to be aged, blind, or disabled. These populations are of interest to lawmakers primarily for two reasons: (1) they are more likely to need LTSS, and (2) they account for a large share of Medicaid spending. ", "Older adults and individuals with disabilities are more likely to need LTSS due to physical limitations, cognitive impairment, or chronic disabling health conditions. Those with LTSS needs are a diverse group that range in age from very young children to older adults. Disabilities can be wide ranging, including, for example, physical limitations, visual impairments (i.e., blindness), intellectual or developmental disabilities, cognitive and behavioral health conditions, traumatic brain injuries, and HIV/AIDS. ", "Federal policymakers have an interest in understanding Medicaid eligibility as the program is an important source of coverage for those with long-term care needs. Medicaid provides LTSS coverage (e.g., extended nursing facility care, personal care, and other home and community-based services) that is generally not covered by Medicare or major health insurance plans offered in the private market. As the largest single payer of LTSS in the United States, Medicaid plays a key role in providing LTSS coverage. In 2016, total Medicaid LTSS spending (federal and state combined) was $154 billion, accounting for 42% of all LTSS expenditures nationally. ", "Because many older adults and individuals with disabilities use LTSS, they tend to account for a disproportionate share of Medicaid spending, which has implications for both federal and state budgets. In FY2016, Medicaid provided health care services to about 71 million enrollees, with expenditures of approximately $538 billion (federal and state combined). Although older adults and individuals with disabilities made up only about one-quarter (23%) of all Medicaid enrollees that year, they accounted for more than half (54%) of all benefit spending. Among all Medicaid enrollees, 30% of Medicaid spending in FY2013 was on LTSS, compared with 62% among older adults (i.e., aged) and 36% among individuals with disabilities (i.e., disabled).", "The next section of this report provides an overview of Medicaid eligibility, followed by a summary of eligibility pathways for older adults and individuals with disabilities.

Most (but not all) ABD pathways recognize blindness as a distinct condition from other disabilities and, as such, provide separate categorical criteria for this condition. However, when reporting data on broad categorical eligibility groups, CMS includes statutorily blind individuals in the \"disabled\" category. ", "Individuals with disabilities may also be eligible for Medicaid under pathways available more broadly to able-bodied children and adults for a number of reasons; for example, because they do not meet the definition of disability under an ABD eligibility pathway, have income or assets above certain limits, do not meet the state-based level-of-care criteria, or have one or more chronic condition(s) but have not developed a chronic-disabling condition.

Medicaid eligibility rules reflected these historical program linkages\u00e2\u0080\u0094both in terms of the categories of individuals who were served, and because the financial eligibility rules were generally based on the most closely related social program for the group involved (e.g., AFDC program rules for low-income families with dependent children and pregnant women, and SSI program rules for aged, blind, or disabled individuals). Over time, Medicaid eligibility has expanded to allow states to extend coverage to individuals whose eligibility is not based on the receipt of cash assistance, including the most recent addition of the ACA Medicaid expansion population (i.e., individuals under the age of 65 with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level).

", "Although MAGI applies to most Medicaid eligible populations, certain populations (e.g., older adults and individuals with disabilities) are statutorily exempt from MAGI income-counting rules. Instead, Medicaid financial eligibility for MAGI-exempted populations is based on the income-counting rules that match the most closely related social program for the group involved (e.g., SSI program rules for the aged, blind, or disabled eligibility groups). Thus, SSI program rules form the foundation of Medicaid eligibility for older adults and individuals with disabilities under mandatory and optional eligibility pathways and include both an income and a resource or asset test (see the next section for more information on SSI rules).", "However, under optional SSI-Related and Other ABD eligibility pathways, states may modify SSI program rules when determining income- and resource-counting methodologies. For example, some optional eligibility pathways allow states to choose their own income- or resource-counting methodology. Other eligibility pathways allow states to use Section 1902(r)(2) of the SSA, which lets them choose more liberal income- or resource-counting methodologies than those under the SSI program. Thus, for certain optional eligibility pathways, a state can choose to include or disregard certain sources of income or resources, in part or in whole, when determining whether an applicant meets the income or resource standards for that optional eligibility pathway.

"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Medically Needy", "paragraphs": ["The Medically Needy option is targeted toward individuals with high medical expenses who would otherwise be eligible for Medicaid except that their income exceeds the income standards for other state-covered eligibility pathways. Individuals may qualify in one of two ways: either (1) their income or resources are at or below a state established standard, or (2) they spend down their income to the state-established standard by subtracting incurred medical expenses from their income. For example, if an individual has $1,000 in monthly income and the state's income threshold is $600, then the applicant would be required to incur $400 in out-of-pocket medical expenses during a state-determined budget period before being eligible for Medicaid. Examples of medical expenses that may be deducted from income include Medicare and other health insurance premiums, deductibles and coinsurance charges, and other medical expenses included in the state's Medicaid plan or recognized under state law. For individuals who spend down to Medicaid eligibility, states select a specific time period for determining whether or not the applicant meets the spend-down obligation, often referred to as a \"budget period,\" which generally ranges from one to six months.", "States that choose to offer the Medically Needy option must cover pregnant women and children under the age of 18, and may choose to extend eligibility to the aged, blind, or disabled, among other groups. The Medically Needy option allows aged and disabled individuals who need expensive institutional LTSS to qualify for Medicaid nursing facility services. However, nursing facility services are optional services that states may elect to cover for Medically Needy individuals. ", "Under the Medically Needy option, states establish the income eligibility standard; however, it may be no higher than 133\u00e2\u0085\u0093% of the state's AFDC level in 1996. Typically, the AFDC level is lower than the income standard for SSI benefits. For example, in 2015 the median Medically Needy income standard for an individual was $483 per month, or about 49% of the FPL. States use the SSI income-counting methodology for aged, blind, or disabled individuals. States also set the resource standards within certain federal requirements. For aged, blind, or disabled individuals, the resource standard is generally the same as in the SSI program. In general, states must use SSI's applicable definition of disability when determining eligibility for the disabled eligibility group. In 2018, 32 states and the District of Columbia offered coverage to the Medically Needy."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix. Medicaid Eligibility Pathways That Cover Older Adults and Individuals with Disabilities", "paragraphs": [" Table A-1 lists selected Medicaid eligibility pathways that cover older adults and individuals with disabilities.
