Rather, an individual's \"adjudication as a mental defective\" relies upon a determination or decision by \"a court, board, commission, or other lawful authority.\"", "Physicians and other health care providers generally do not fall within this list of authorized decision-makers, with the exception of certain instances under state law where a health care provider may be authorized by statute to admit a patient to involuntary psychiatric treatment.

For example, in United States v. Waters , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the involuntary hospitalization of an alleged mentally ill individual pursuant to New York state law met the definition of an \"involuntary commitment\" for purposes of the GCA, even though the hospitalization was ordered by the director of a hospital upon the certification of two physicians.", "However, at least one federal court has held that the Supreme Court's recent recognition of an individual right to possess a firearm in District of Columbia v. Heller , suggests that some emergency hospitalization or commitment procedures should not be included within the meaning of \"involuntary commitment\" for purposes of the GCA. In United States v. Rehlander , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (First Circuit) considered a Maine law which provides authority for the brief, but involuntary, detention of individuals in mental institutions on the basis of a medical provider's examination and certification that the individual is mentally ill and poses a likelihood of serious harm. In pre- Heller cases, the First Circuit had held that this emergency hospitalization under Maine law qualified as \"involuntary commitment\" under the GCA. However, because the procedures under state law were ex parte and did not have additional procedural safeguards, the court held that construing the emergency hospitalization procedures to qualify as \"involuntary commitment\" under the GCA post- Heller would risk depriving individuals of their right to bear arms without sufficient due process. Therefore, the appellate court overturned its earlier decisions and held that such emergency hospitalizations were not \"involuntary commitments.\" "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOJ Proposal to Amend \"Adjudicated as a Mental Defective\" and \"Committed to a Mental Institution\"", "paragraphs": ["On January 7, 2014, DOJ issued a notice of its proposed rule to amend the definitions of \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" and \"committed to a mental institution.\" The term \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" is currently composed of two subsections. The proposed amendment primarily makes changes to the second subsection, which currently provides that the term includes (1) a finding of insanity by a court in a criminal case, and (2) a finding of incompetency to stand trial or a finding of not guilty by lack of mental responsibility pursuant to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The proposed rule would amend this part to clarify that the term applies to all courts, not only the military judicial system, that determine an individual to be not guilty by reason of insanity in a criminal case, or guilty but mentally ill, or incompetent to stand trial in a criminal case. Furthermore, the proposed rule adds a third subsection, which would clarify that the term \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" does not include any person adjudicated but who has subsequently received relief from disability pursuant to federal law (18 U.S.C. \u00a7925(c)) or under a state program authorized by federal law. In addition, the term would not include any person who is adjudicated by a federal agency if the adjudication meets certain conditions. These include if (1) the record has been set aside or the individual has been released from treatment; (2) the person has been found by the court or board to no longer suffer from the condition that was the basis of the adjudication or commitment; or (3) the adjudication or commitment is based solely on a medical finding of disability, without opportunity to be heard by a court or board. ", "The second term, \"committed to a mental institution,\" currently covers formal commitments, including those which are involuntary, of a person to a mental institution for mental defectiveness or illness by a court, board, commission, or other lawful authority. It also currently includes commitments for other reasons, including drug use, but does not include a person who is in a mental institution either voluntarily or only for observation. DOJ's proposed rule would maintain the existing definition but amend it to reflect that such commitments include \"an involuntary commitment to a mental institution for inpatient or outpatient treatment.\" The term would continue to exclude those who are in a mental institution solely for observation or evaluation, as well as those who have voluntarily admitted themselves. The proposed rule clarifies that the term also excludes persons undergoing voluntary outpatient treatment. In its notice, DOJ explains that \"temporary admission for observation\" would not be included under the term unless it \"turns into a qualifying commitment as a result of formal commitment by a court, board, commission or other lawful authority.\" This explanation and the proposed minor changes to the definition would seem to strongly suggest that emergency hospitalizations, as discussed above, are to be excluded. However, the proposed rule does not appear to include explicit language that could provide more guidance to the states or the courts regarding the types of involuntary commitments made by physicians, who are acting as an \"other lawful authority,\" that would be included under the term.

The \"mental health records\" reported to NICS include only individual identifiers and no actual medical information.

However, this increase largely reflected the efforts of 12 states. According to GAO, almost half of all states increased the number of mental health records they reported by fewer than 100 over the same time period.", "Both DOJ and state officials told GAO that a variety of technological, coordination, and legal (i.e., privacy) challenges limit the states' ability to report mental health records. Technological challenges include updating aging computer systems and integrating existing record systems. Several states reported using their NARIP grant funding to automate the collection and transmission of records. DOJ officials further emphasized that the technological challenges", "are particularly salient for mental health records because these records originate from numerous sources within the state\u2014such as courts, private hospitals, and state offices of mental health\u2014and are not typically captured by any single state agency. For example, records that involve involuntary commitments to a mental institution typically originate in entities located throughout a state and outside the scope of law enforcement, and therefore a state may lack processes to automatically make these records available to the FBI.", "The fact that mental health records often originate in hospitals and health departments, which are typically not connected to law enforcement agencies that make the majority of records available to NICS, presents challenges in getting all the relevant entities to collaborate. As an example, GAO cited an April 2012 report by the state of Illinois, Office of the Auditor General, which found that for 2010, approximately 114,000 mental health records were maintained in nursing homes, private hospitals, state mental health facilities, and circuit courts. However, only about 5,000 records were reported to NICS because of a lack of coordination and other challenges. Citing privacy concerns, officials in three of the six states reviewed by GAO reported that the absence of explicit statutory authority to share mental health records was an impediment to NICS reporting.

MAIG interviewed officials in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and found that state reporting of mental health records to NICS is impeded by a complex set of obstacles including technological and logistical problems, privacy concerns, insufficient funding, and a lack of leadership. The MAIG report noted that even among states with strong reporting programs, there is considerable variation in the number and type of mental health records submitted to NICS. It found that states that have significantly improved their reporting in the past few years share a number of common attributes including the ability to commit funding to their efforts and effective political leadership. MAIG also found a strong association between reporting levels and enactment of state laws that require or authorize agencies to report their records.

Those standards include certain individual privacy rights, such as the right of access to one's health information and the right to request corrections, as well as limitations on the use or disclosure of personal health information. The rule applies to (1) health plans; (2) health care clearinghouses; and (3) health care providers who transmit health information electronically in connection with one of the HIPAA-covered financial or administrative transactions.

PHI is defined as individually identifiable information that relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health of an individual; the provision of health care to an individual; or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to an individual.", "In the broadest sense, the Privacy Rule prohibits a covered entity from using or disclosing PHI except as expressly permitted or required by the rule. As briefly outlined below, the rule describes a range of circumstances under which it is permissible to use or disclose PHI. In all such instances covered entities can choose whether to use or disclose PHI based on their professional ethics and best judgment. The rule specifies only two circumstances when a covered entity is required to disclose PHI. A covered entity must disclose PHI to (1) the individual who is the subject of the information (i.e., patient right of access), and (2) HHS officials investigating potential violations of the rule. For a discussion on the proposed modification to the HIPAA Privacy Rule, see \" HHS Proposal to Amend HIPAA Privacy Rule .\"", "Generally, covered entities may use or disclose PHI for the purposes of treatment, payment, and other routine health care operations with few restrictions. Under other specific circumstances (e.g., disclosures to family members and friends), the rule requires covered entities to give the individual the opportunity to object to the disclosure (i.e., opt out). Importantly, the rule also permits the use or disclosure of PHI for several specified \"national priority purposes\" that are not directly connected to the treatment of the individual. These uses and disclosures are permitted by the rule in recognition of the important uses made of health information outside of the health care context. They include the following uses and disclosures:", "Required by law. Covered entities may use or disclose PHI to the extent that such use or disclosure is required by (federal or state) law and the disclosure complies with and is limited to the relevant requirements of such law. Law enforcement purposes. Covered entities may disclose PHI to law enforcement officials for certain specified law enforcement purposes. Averting a serious threat to health or safety. Consistent with applicable law and standards of ethical conduct, a health care provider may use or disclose PHI if the provider in good faith believes the use or disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of a person or the public. Specialized government functions. Covered entities may use or disclose PHI for several specified essential government functions.", "For all uses or disclosures of PHI that are not otherwise permitted or required by the rule, covered entities must obtain a patient's written authorization.", "As discussed above, prohibiting mental health records under the GCA are typically generated by the courts that adjudicate persons as mentally defective, and by the courts and health care providers that involuntarily commit individuals to mental health facilities. While courts are not covered entities and are not subject to the HIPAA Privacy Rule, health care providers such as hospitals and state health departments are covered by the Privacy Rule and, therefore, may not use or disclose PHI for the purpose of NICS reporting without express permission under the rule.

This would be the case even if the state expressly allowed, but did not explicitly require, disclosure of prohibiting mental health records to NICS because merely permissive state laws are insufficient to exempt disclosure from the HIPAA Privacy Rule. As discussed below, HHS has proposed amendments to the HIPAA Privacy Rule that would permit disclosure to NICS where a state has a permissive disclosure law.", "It should also be noted that both types of entities\u2014courts and health care providers\u2014may also be subject to state health privacy laws that may be more protective of individually identifiable health information than the HIPAA Privacy Rule and other state-level requirements and policies. State laws that are more protective of privacy include those that prohibit or restrict a use or disclosure that would otherwise be permitted under the Privacy Rule, and those that provide individuals with greater access to their own health information. This final section of the report provides a basic overview of the different types of state privacy laws that may impact the sharing of prohibiting mental health records with NICS.", " Figure 1 summarizes state laws, as of January 1, 2013, that address the reporting of mental health records for use in firearm purchaser background checks. Twenty-three states have NICS reporting mandates. These laws require courts and, in some instances, mental health facilities to report (1) to NICS directly, or (2) to a state agency that in turn reports to NICS. As noted above, the HIPAA Privacy Rule would not bar the mandated disclosures in these states. Note that in one of the states\u2014Delaware\u2014reporting by mental health facilities takes the place of court reporting (see Figure 1 ). ", "Seven states have laws that authorize, but do not require, reporting to NICS. In these states that do not mandate reporting, HIPAA-covered entities do not appear to have permission under the Privacy Rule to use or disclose PHI for the purpose of preparing and reporting mental health records to NICS. Absent a state reporting mandate, it is not clear that there are any other provisions in the Privacy Rule that provide such permission. ", "None of the three other national priority purposes in the Privacy Rule discussed earlier (under \"HIPAA Privacy Rule Overview\") address reporting to federal databases for the purposes of future background checks. The disclosure of PHI for law enforcement purposes has to be (1) as required by law; (2) pursuant to various specified judicial and administrative processes and procedures such as court orders, subpoenas, and summonses; or (3) in response to one of several other specified law enforcement activities. The Privacy Rule's provisions authorizing the use or disclosure of PHI for various specialized government functions list a number of specific activities, none of which includes reporting information to the NICS databases. Finally, the rule's provisions that permit the use and disclosure of PHI to avert a serious threat to health or safety focus on two types of situations, neither of which appears to include NICS reporting. The first permits the disclosure of PHI to a person or persons reasonably able to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of a person or the public. The second concerns alerting law enforcement authorities about an individual involved in a violent crime or who has escaped from prison or lawful custody. ", "An additional eight states collect mental health records pursuant to state law, but these laws do not address NICS reporting. Again, without a NICS reporting mandate, HIPAA-covered entities do not appear to have permission under the Privacy Rule to use PHI for the purpose of reporting mental health records to the federal databases. These states include California, which despite the absence of a NICS reporting mandate, has one of the best NICS reporting rates for mental health records. In part this is because of a state law that requires mental health facilities to report mental health records to the California Department of Justice (DOJ). That requirement effectively removes HIPAA as an impediment to such reporting by HIPAA-covered entities. While state law is silent on DOJ reporting to NICS, California has developed a reporting infrastructure and entered into an agreement with the federal government to report mental health records to NICS.", "Finally, 13 states are without laws requiring or authorizing the collection or reporting of mental health records for use in firearm purchaser background checks, either at the state or federal level. Once again, HIPAA-covered entities in these states that are in possession of disqualifying mental health records appear to lack the authority under the Privacy Rule to report such information to NICS.", "While a detailed examination of state-level activities is beyond the scope of this report, it should be emphasized that many states collect and use mental health records (and other relevant information) pursuant to state law or policies for their own background checks of firearm purchases. Some states are \"Point-Of-Contact\" (POC) states, meaning that the state agency is responsible for electronically accessing NICS and for implementing and maintaining their own Brady NICS program. Often times a POC state will run the background check against the state's own records, some of which may not be in NICS. In some instances, background checks conducted by POCs may be more stringent than non-POC states because they have access to more access to disqualifying records. In addition, these states could be more thorough in their background checks because statutory prohibitions on firearm possession in these states sometimes exceed the federal prohibitions under the Brady Act. However, unlike the nationwide NICS background checks, state-level checks do not capture prohibited individuals who cross state lines to purchase long guns."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HHS Proposal to Amend HIPAA Privacy Rule", "paragraphs": ["On January 7, 2014, HHS's Office for Civil Rights (OCR), which administers and enforces the Privacy Rule, issued a proposed rule that would modify the HIPAA Privacy Rule \"to expressly permit certain HIPAA covered entities to disclose\" to NICS the identities of certain individuals who are subject to the mental health disqualification under the GCA.", "Relying on its authority under HIPAA, which provides HHS with discretion to modify the privacy standards as appropriate but not more than once a year, HHS proposes to add a new, narrowly tailored provision to the Privacy Rule that would expressly \" permit [not require] certain covered entities to disclose the minimum necessary demographic and other information for NICS reporting purposes, which would not include clinical, diagnostic, or other mental health information\" (emphasis added). The modification is meant to \"produce clarity regarding the Privacy Rule and help make it as simple as possible for States to report the identities of such individuals to the NICS.\" It would not affect the currently existing permitted uses and disclosures of PHI under the Privacy Rule, as discussed above.", "The rule would allow only HIPAA-covered entities to report individuals who are prohibited under the federal mental health prohibitor (18 U.S.C. \u00a7922(g)(4)) and not for other disqualifying factors under the GCA. In other words, a covered entity would not be permitted to disclose identifying information to NICS for an individual who is prohibited from possessing a firearm under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7922(g)(3)\u2014that is, an unlawful user of, or a person who is addicted to, any controlled substance\u2014except to the extent that such drug use is connected to being \"committed to a mental institution.\" HHS also notes that states may have a broader mental health prohibition related to firearms, and that information related to these state prohibitors may not be reported to NICS. HHS also seeks comment from states related to the scope of the proposed rule on whether HIPAA is currently perceived as a barrier to reporting to NICS about individuals who are subject to state law firearm prohibitions and whether the final rule should address this aspect. HHS explains, however, that broadening the scope to also encompass state law mental health prohibitors could increase the likelihood that more treating providers would be permitted to report information to NICS. As currently drafted, the new provision primarily aims to cover HIPAA-covered entities performing the relevant commitment, adjudicatory, or repository functions, and not those performing solely treatment functions.", "Other areas where HHS seeks public comment for purposes of the final rule include", "whether there are states in which a type of entity not described in the proposed paragraph is responsible for NICS reporting and is one that needs to be able to receive NICS data from HIPAA-covered entities; whether, and in what circumstances, HIPAA-covered entities or other entities such as courts currently report to a records repository or directly to NICS information that is not listed in the proposed rule; what types of additional data elements\u2014such as Social Security number, place of birth, state of residence, physical description\u2014that HHS may permit disclosure of for purposes of reporting to NICS; and the types of additional guidance that OCR and/or NICS could issue that would be helpful for understanding the proposed rule. ", "Should the proposed amendments to the HIPAA Privacy Rule become final, there may be a gradual increase in the number of records shared with NICS by covered entities. It should be noted, however, that states may still lack the infrastructure, capital, or political support to establish a system that allows records to be shared with NICS or an appropriate repository that shares with NICS. "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["During the past few years, questions have arisen with respect to the efficacy of the federal background check that is required for certain firearm transfers. Of particular congressional focus is whether enough records of individuals who are prohibited by federal law from firearm possession because they have been \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" are being shared with NICS, the system through which background checks are generally conducted. In particular, the question has become whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule or state privacy laws are an obstacle to the population of NICS with prohibiting mental health records. ", "Although the HIPAA Privacy Rule currently allows disclosure of information where state law expressly requires disclosure of records to NICS, some state officials have reported that they view state health privacy laws and the HIPAA Privacy Rule as potential obstacles to NICS reporting. In response to these concerns, HHS proposed a rule that would modify the HIPAA Privacy Rule \"to expressly permit [but not require] certain HIPAA covered entities to disclose\" to NICS the identities of individuals who are subject to the mental health disqualification under federal firearms law. Interestingly, HHS seeks comments from states on whether its proposed rule should also permit HIPAA-covered entities to share records with NICS regarding individuals who are prohibited from firearm possession due to mental health reasons under state firearms laws, the coverage of which may be broader than the federal mental health prohibitor. ", "Another question long unaddressed and unclear to states is whether the term \"committed to a mental institution\" includes individuals who are ordered by a court, board, or other lawful authority to receive outpatient treatment. To clarify this, DOJ also has proposed a rule that would clarify that the term includes both mandatory inpatient and outpatient commitments. Due to the perceived barriers under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, as well as uncertainties in the relevant federal definitions, states have been reluctant to share relevant mental health records with NICS. With clarifications in these areas under way, states could ultimately turn over more relevant records to NICS, though some may still be hindered by deficiencies in their technological capacity to share such records with NICS."], "subsections": []}]}}
