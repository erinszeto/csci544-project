Critics argue that lack of leadership and coordination is one of the primary deficiencies in the existing U.N. system gender structure.

Some experts have criticized the governance of existing gender entities. Many, for instance, express concern with what they view as UNIFEM's secondary status in the U.N. system. Unlike specialized agencies with their own governance and in-country operations, UNIFEM is autonomously associated with UNDP. It is led by an executive director, while the UNDP administrator is accountable for UNIFEM's management and operation.

It is the only U.N. intergovernmental policymaking body that specifically addresses issues related to women. It is composed of 45 member state representatives elected by the council (other states serve as observers) who meet annually at U.N. Headquarters. CSW observes, monitors, and implements measures for the advancement of women. It also reviews and supports gender mainstreaming in the U.N. system.

World Conferences on Women", "U.N. member states have sought to address women's equality and gender empowerment through four World Conferences specifically addressing issues related to women. The first conference, held in 1974 in Mexico City, inaugurated the U.N. \"Decade on Women,\" which spanned from 1976 to 1985. The second conference was held in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1980, and the third was held in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1985. The conferences addressed and expressed member states commitments to achieving (1) equality between men and women, (2) the integration of women into development, and (3) recognition of the participation of women in achieving world peace. The conferences also focused on women's health, work, and education.", "The Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing in 1995, sought to build on commitments made at previous conferences. The conference had two outcome documents: the Beijing Declaration and the Platform for Action , which were adopted by consensus (185 governments). The Beijing Declaration reaffirmed member state commitments to equal rights for men and women and the empowerment and advancement of women. Governments also expressed their determination to intensify efforts to ensure full human rights for women and girls, eliminate discrimination against women, promote sustainable development and education, combat violence against women and girls, and ensure equal access to economic resources. The Platform for Action , described in its mission statement as an \"agenda for women's empowerment,\" reaffirmed the human rights of women and girls and called for strong commitments by U.N. member states to take specific actions to address issues affecting women, including poverty, education, health, violence against women, armed conflict, decision-making, environment, and economic inequality.

This includes equality in legal status, political participation, employment, education, health care, and the family structure. Article 2 of the Convention specifies that States Parties should undertake to \"embody the principle of equality of men and women in their national constitutions or other appropriate legislation ... to ensure, through law and other appropriate means, the practical realization of this principle.\" As of April 29, 2009, 186 countries have ratified or acceded to the Convention.

The Committee is responsible for reviewing the reports on national CEDAW implementation submitted by States Parties. Countries are required to submit an initial report within the first year of ratification or accession, followed by a report every four years. The reports identify areas of progress as well as concerns or difficulties with implementation. The Committee engages in an open dialogue and exchange of ideas with the reporting country and compiles recommendations and conclusions based on its findings, which include general recommendations on cross-cutting issues of concern.

Population Fund (UNFPA) ", "UNFPA, established in 1969, is the world's largest source of population and reproductive health programs and the principal unit within the United Nations for global population issues. In 2008, the organization provided services in some 158 developing and transition countries, with funds totaling $845.3 million, drawn primarily from voluntary contributions made by nations and some foundations. UNFPA does not focus exclusively on women. However, because it addresses family planning and reproductive health, the majority of its activities directly affect the lives of women and girls. ", "In the past 25 years, there has been continuing and contentious debate within the United States, especially among Members of Congress, as to whether the United States should financially support UNFPA. This debate has centered on the extent to which, if any, UNFPA aids China's coercive family planning programs and policies. In 16 of the past 26 years, the United States did not contribute to the organization as a result of executive branch determinations that UNFPA's program in China violated the \"Kemp-Kasten\" amendment, which bans U.S. aid to organizations involved in the management of coercive family planning programs. From FY2002 through FY2008, the George W. Bush Administration found UNFPA ineligible for funding under the Kemp-Kasten amendment. In March 2009, President Obama expressed his support for UNFPA, and in December 2009 signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 ( P.L. 111-117 ), which directed that $55 million shall be made available for the organization.", "V.

The resolution, which is strongly supported by the United States, addresses the impact of war and conflict on women and highlights the need for protection of women and girls from human rights abuses. Specifically, the resolution calls on all parties to armed conflict to \"take special measures to protect women and girls from gender-based violence, particularly rape and other forms of sexual abuse, and all other forms of violence in situations of armed conflict.\" It also urges U.N. member states and the U.N. Secretary-General to work toward increased representation and participation of women in all decision-making levels in national, regional, and international institutions that address conflict resolution, management, and prevention.

Security Council adopted Resolution 1888, which demanded that all parties to armed conflict \"take appropriate measures to protect civilians, including women and children, from all forms of sexual violence.\" It reaffirmed that sexual violence, when used as a tactic of war or as part of a widespread attack against civilian populations, can exacerbate armed conflict situations and may impede the restoration of international peace and security. The resolution called on the Secretary-General to appoint a Special Representative to provide leadership to address sexual violence in armed conflict, and to rapidly deploy a team of experts to situations of particular concern. The United States, which served as Security Council President for October, strongly supported the adoption of the resolution, with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton serving as Chair of the Council meeting when the resolution was adopted.
