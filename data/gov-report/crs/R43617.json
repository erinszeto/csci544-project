It next discusses the FY2015 appropriations contained in H.R. 5171 as reported by the House Appropriations Committee and the appropriations recommended in the Senate Interior Subcommittee draft.

", "Appropriations are complex. For example, the budget requests for some agencies are large, numbering several hundred pages and containing numerous funding, programmatic, and legislative changes for congressional consideration. Further, appropriations laws provide funds for numerous accounts, activities, and subactivities, and the accompanying explanatory statements provide additional directives and other important information. This report does not provide account- and subaccount-level information. Further, it does not discuss agency highlights under the President's request, the House committee-reported bill, the Senate Interior Subcommittee draft, or the FY2015 appropriations law, such as increases, decreases, budgetary reorganizations, and legislative changes.

For the 10 major DOI agencies in Title I of the bill, the request was $10.86 billion, or 35.4% of the total requested. For EPA, funded by Title II of the bill, the request was $7.89 billion, or 25.7% of the total. For about 20 agencies and other entities typically funded in Title III of the bill, the request was $11.94 billion, or 38.9% of the total. ", "Appropriations for agencies vary widely for a number of reasons relating to the number, breadth, and complexity of agency responsibilities; alternative sources of funding (e.g., mandatory appropriations); and Administration and congressional priorities, among other factors. Thus, although the President's FY2015 request covered approximately 30 agencies, funding for a small subset of these agencies accounted for most of the total. For example, the appropriations for three agencies\u2014EPA, Forest Service, and Indian Health Service\u2014were about three-fifths (59.4%) of the total requested. Further, more than three-quarters (76.3%) of the request was for these three agencies and two others\u2014National Park Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs. ", "For DOI agencies, the requests ranged from $72.4 million for the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to $2.61 billion for the National Park Service. The requests for 6 of the 10 agencies exceeded $1 billion. Nearly half (47.7%) of the $10.86 billion requested for DOI agencies was for two agencies\u2014the National Park Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs.", "For Related Agencies in Title III, the requested funding levels showed even more variation. The President did not seek funding for one agency that received FY2014 appropriations (National Capital Arts and Cultural Affairs), and the President sought amounts ranging from $2.5 million for the Commission of Fine Arts to $5.71 billion for the Forest Service. Other than the Forest Service, the Indian Health Service would have been the only other agency to receive more than $4 billion under the President's proposal. The next-largest request was for the Smithsonian Institution, at $850.9 million. By contrast, 14 agencies would have received less than $80 million each, including 7 with appropriations of less than $10 million each.

", "The overall increase proposed for FY2015 was the result of various increases and decreases sought for different agencies/entities. For instance, under the President's proposal, the total for all DOI agencies would have increased by $381.3 million (3.6%), funding for EPA would have decreased by $310.0 million (-3.8%), and the total for all Related Agencies in Title III would have increased by $500.5 million (4.4%). ", "With regard to DOI, for 7 of the 10 agencies the President proposed increases above FY2014. The increases varied in dollar amount and percentage of appropriations, with the lowest dollar increase of $2.4 million (3.1%) for the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement and the highest of $182.2 million (19.5%) for Department-Wide Programs. Most of the increase under Department-Wide Programs was for Wildland Fire Management. For the other three DOI agencies, the President sought decreases varying from $5.3 million (-3.5%) for the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement to $10.4 million (-1.7%) for Departmental Offices. ", "The President's proposed overall decrease for EPA was largely due to a $529.8 million reduction (-15.0%) for the State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG) account. Most of the proposed decrease in the STAG account was attributed to a combined reduction below the FY2014 enacted funding for grants that provide financial assistance to states to help capitalize Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (SRFs). Respectively, these funds finance local wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects. The STAG account also includes funds for other grants used by states and tribes. The President sought overall increases for all other EPA accounts above the FY2014 enacted levels. The $113.0 million (4.3%) increase for the Environmental Programs and Management (EPM) account was the largest overall dollar increase among the EPA accounts. The EPM account funds a broad array of activities supporting EPA's development and enforcement of pollution control regulations and standards, technical assistance, and administrative and operational expenses.", "The President's overall increase proposed for Title III agencies reflected various increases and decreases. Half of the agencies would have received higher funding under the request, but the three largest agencies would have received the largest dollar increases. Specifically, the President sought an additional $227.6 million (4.2%) for the Forest Service, $199.7 million (4.5%) for the Indian Health Service, and $45.9 million (5.7%) for the Smithsonian Institution. The increase for the Forest Service would have been primarily for suppressing wildland fires and for the National Forest System account. The Indian Health Service would have received additional funds for many programs and activities, including clinical services and contract support costs. The increase for the Smithsonian would have been for the National Museum of African American History and Culture, outreach, facilities services, and revitalization of facilities, among other purposes. For several other agencies funded in Title III, the President sought level funding. For instance, the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities would each have been funded at the FY2014 level of $146.0 million. Still other Title III agencies would have received varying reductions in funding, with funding eliminated for National Capital Arts and Cultural Affairs.
