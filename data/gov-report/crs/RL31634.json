The Act created federal standards for insurers, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), and employer-provided health plans, including those that self-insure. It permitted, however, substantial state flexibility for compliance with the requirements on insurers.", "HIPAA also included tax provisions relating to health insurance. It permitted a limited number of small businesses and self-employed individuals to contribute to tax-advantaged medical savings accounts (MSAs) established in conjunction with high-deductible health insurance plans. It increased the deduction for health insurance that self-employed taxpayers may claim. In addition, it allowed long-term care expenses to be treated like deductible medical expenses and clarified the tax treatment of long-term care insurance.", "Finally, the Act included administrative simplification and privacy provisions instructing the Secretary of HHS to issue standards addressing the electronic transmission of health information and the privacy of personally identifiable medical information.", "Since the passage of HIPAA, there have been subsequent amendments. In 1996, new provisions required group health plans and insurers to cover minimum hospital stays for maternity care and for a limited period, to provide parity in certain mental health benefits. Parity was later extended for one year. In 1998, a provision was passed requiring health plans that cover mastectomy to also offer reconstructive breast surgery. Amendments have also increased the tax deduction for premiums paid by self-employed taxpayers.", "The Act, as amended, continues to generate numerous questions. What kinds of policies does it cover? Does it help people who are currently uninsured? Does it help people with preexisting medical conditions? How does it affect health insurance premiums? How do its requirements interact with the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) continuation coverage? Answers to those questions, as well as other commonly asked questions, are provided, as well as descriptions of each of the major sections of HIPAA.", "Some of the answers provided may not be definitive. This is because, in some cases, final regulations have not yet been promulgated. Other regulations, such as those defining the administrative simplification provisions, remain under development. In addition, the answers to many questions about the requirements on the individual health insurance market depend upon particular state responses to the Act.

The Act in General", "paragraphs": ["The basic intent of HIPAA's health insurance provisions is to lower the possibility that people and small employers will lose existing health plan coverage, and to make it easier for individuals to switch plans or to purchase coverage on their own if they lose employer-offered coverage. The health insurance reforms ensure that people who are moving from one job to another or from employment to unemployment are not denied health insurance because they have a preexisting medical condition (portability) and limit the waiting time before a plan covers any preexisting medical condition for participants and beneficiaries in group health plans. The reforms were also intended to guarantee that individuals and employers who choose to purchase coverage are able to find a plan (guaranteed issue) and that individuals already covered, as well as employers that offer coverage to their employees, are able to renew their coverage (guaranteed renewal). Finally, the health insurance provisions prohibit discrimination on the basis of health status (non-discrimination) and require plans to offer special enrollment periods.", "Other HIPAA provisions seek to make health insurance more affordable. The Act raised the tax deduction for health insurance premiums paid by the self-employed. MSAs coupled with qualified high deductible health insurance plans were made available on a trial basis to a limited number of individuals. New tax incentives were made available to encourage individuals and employers to purchase long-term care insurance. Finally, the Act included administrative simplification and privacy provisions instructing the Secretary of HHS to issue standards addressing the electronic transmission of health information and the privacy of personally identifiable medical information.", "Additional federal protections have been added since the passage of HIPAA. The protections required plans that cover newborn delivery to allow for a minimum two-day hospital stay under certain conditions, required plans that offer mental health services to offer them subject to similar limitations as other health benefits, and required plans that cover mastectomy to also cover reconstructive surgery.

It also would help those who have been denied the option to purchase insurance as an individual or through their employer because of their health status. They do not address the larger problem of the uninsured, estimated to be 45 million people in 2003, although other HIPAA provisions, such as the tax deductibility of health insurance costs for the self-employed, may encourage some uninsured, self-employed individuals to purchase coverage for themselves.", "It is also the case that HIPAA largely addresses the availability of insurance and does not regulate the price of health insurance coverage. Some evidence suggests that the cost of health insurance in the individual market for individuals taking advantage of HIPAA's group-to-individual portability provisions is significantly higher than the cost for individuals who could otherwise obtain insurance.

The plan cannot apply any preexisting condition waiting period on pregnancy, a covered newborn, or on any covered child under 18 who is adopted (even if the adoption is not finalized). However, the employer may still require individuals to work for a period of time before they are allowed to participate in the health plan. This is called a \"waiting period\" and should not be confused with a \"preexisting condition limitation period.\" Employers who sponsor group health plans are required to provide enrollees with a certificate that states the amount of creditable coverage accumulated and whether or not the enrollee was subject to a waiting period under the employer's plan.

For example, individuals with 6 months of prior creditable coverage could face a maximum preexisting condition limitation period of 6 months. Individuals with 11 months of prior creditable coverage could face a maximum limitation period of 1 month.

Any waiting period required before an employee or his or family member can become a plan participant or beneficiary must run concurrently with any preexisting condition limitation period. For example, if an employer required an employee without any creditable coverage to work for 5 months before he or she could enroll in the firm's health plan, then the preexisting condition limitation period imposed on the coverage of that individual could not exceed 7 months from the date of actual enrollment in the plan.

The April 8, 1997 interim rule defines the categories of benefits that may be considered separately to be: (a) mental health; (b) substance abuse treatment; (c) prescription drugs; (d) dental care; or (e) vision care. Thus, for example, if a prior plan did not cover prescription drugs, and the new plan includes this benefit, the new plan may exclude coverage of prescription drugs for up to 12 months under this second method.

They are intended to streamline administrative operations within the health care system, which currently stores and transmits health information in numerous paper and electronic formats.

CMS has issued standards for both the employer and provider identifiers, but the health plan identifier remains under development.

Lawmakers addressed these concerns by including in HIPAA's administrative simplification provisions a timetable for developing standards to protect the privacy of health information. HIPAA gave Congress until August 21, 1999, to enact comprehensive health privacy legislation, otherwise the Secretary was instructed to develop privacy standards.
