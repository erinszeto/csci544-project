The role could be a catalyst to push us closer to being a more entrepreneurial, high-tech country.", "The Center for American Progress (CAP) and New Democracy Project (NDP), public policy institutes, proposed that the CTO serve as a champion for information and communications technologies broadly. CAP/NDP proposed that the CTO be given three roles: advising the President on the use of ICT to create a more open and efficient government; working with OSTP to advise the President on all issues that have a critical ICT component, including economic, national security, health care, and education policies; and helping to ensure ICT platforms deployed across the United States are robust, broadly available, and affordable to all sectors.

In general, a CTO is responsible for monitoring, assessing, and selecting new technologies for applications to improve an organization's performance. Such applications of technology can be focused on developing new products and services or on improving internal processes. Given the ubiquitous role technology plays in most organizations today, CTOs often work with a wide variety of stakeholders, including chief executives, scientists, engineers, research managers, and marketing professionals. Generally, federal agency CTOs are responsible for developing and/or implementing technologies that enable the agency to better perform its missions. The role of a CTO in a federal agency can be similar to, and the title sometimes used interchangeably with, the CIO. In many cases, agency CTOs report to the CIO and have a focus on information technology. However, some CTOs have responsibility for a wider scope of technologies and technical issues.

If the position or office of the CTO is not established by Congress and provided with statutory authorities and a dedicated budget, it may be difficult for the CTO to affect change in individual federal agencies or systemically throughout the federal government. In such a case, the efficacy of the CTO may depend largely on the mandate provided by President Obama to the CTO (and agencies' perception of the mandate), the imprimatur of the White House, and the personal attributes of the CTO (e.g., relationship with the President, past accomplishments, knowledge, professional reputation, persuasiveness).", "Perhaps one of the most difficult and enduring challenges the CTO may face could be \"turf wars\" associated with overlapping responsibilities with other executive agencies and their principals.

However, in his capacity as assistant to the President and as CTO, both he and the director of OSTP carry the equivalent title of \"assistant to the president.\" In addition, placing the CTO in OSTP may also create jurisdiction issues with the OMB's CPO and CIO functions.

The subtitle would establish the Office of the Chief Technology Officer in the Executive Office of the President, and assign to the position a variety of duties related to the federal government's use of information technology (IT). The duties of the CTO would include supporting efforts to foster the further development of IT through research and development funding, development of public-private partnerships to foster federal knowledge and integration of commercially available IT, and collection and analysis of information about IT trends that may affect the federal government's use of IT to meet its goals. The CTO would also conduct analysis and provide advice to the President and heads of federal departments and agencies with respect to major IT policies, plans, and programs of the federal government. Further, the subtitle designates the CTO as a member of the Domestic Policy Council and the Federal Cyber Security Practice Board. It also requires the CTO to produce an annual report for the President and selected committees of Congress that provides information on programs to promote the development of technological innovations; recommendations for the adoption of policies to encourage the generation of technological innovations; and information on the activities and accomplishments of the Office of the Chief Technology Officer. ", "If Congress chooses to establish the CTO position through statute, there are several issues it may wish to consider. For example:", "What mission, duties, and authorities should be given the CTO? Should one person serve as both the CTO and OSTP associate director for technology? What level of funding should be authorized and/or appropriated for the CTO? Should the CTO be placed in the Executive Office of the President or elsewhere in the executive branch? If in the EOP, should the CTO directly report to the President, or instead be a part of another EOP agency? Who should the CTO report to? Should the appointment of the CTO be subject to Senate confirmation? Should the CTO be a stand-alone position or an office or agency with its own staff? If the CTO is established together with a supporting office or agency, how many full-time equivalent positions should be authorized? What should be the composition of the staff with respect to occupation (e.g., scientists, engineers, IT professionals, lawyers, managers, administrators); political appointees and career civil servants; and permanent employees and employees on detail from other agencies? How should the work of the CTO differ, overlap, and/or complement the duties and authorities of offices in the Executive Office of the President, and other executive branch agencies? What should be the relationship between the President's CTO and the existing CTOs and CIOs of individual departments and agencies?"], "subsections": []}]}}
