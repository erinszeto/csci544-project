The revolving funds generally fall into two categories: the first provides a means of accounting for services provided by one agency to other governmental entities, while the other covers services for the public. Although legislative branch revolving funds comprise a small portion of the total legislative branch operating budget, they have provided a means through which the House, Senate, and legislative branch agencies are able to account for these types of activities. Over time, Congress has revisited their use, structure, and solvency; conducted oversight through hearings and the review of audits; and considered legislation amending the revolving funds, either through proposals offered by Members or at the request of legislative branch agencies.", "Revolving funds must be established statutorily. They may be established for a number of reasons, including a desire (1) to provide separate accounting for transactions between agencies or business-type transactions, (2) to isolate and simplify accounting for a single activity, or (3) to increase flexibility and efficiency of operations. Receipts generated from revolving fund transactions are returned to the individual funds and may be expended without further congressional action, although expenditures are confined to authorized uses. While revolving funds may receive additional budget authority from the legislative branch appropriations bills, the appropriations measures are generally not the primary means of support. Revolving funds are generally intended to operate on a self-sustaining basis with funds retained in the account rather than returned to the U.S. Treasury. Authority to spend funds is provided for in law. The period of availability for amounts in revolving funds also differs depending upon the budget authority provided in the annual appropriations bills. While amounts in those bills are generally available for the fiscal year, unless otherwise specified, amounts in many of the funds are available without fiscal year limitation. ", "The legislative branch currently has 27 revolving funds, including eight funds for the House of Representatives, nine for the Senate, five for the Architect of the Capitol, four for the Library of Congress, and one for the Government Publishing Office.

Provisions addressing the legislative branch revolving funds have been included in the annual and supplemental appropriations bills as well as authorizing legislation. While some of the revolving funds legislation has been focused primarily on financial management, revolving funds have also been amended in response to new programs or activities (for example, the Capitol Visitor Center Act) or broader changes in congressional organization (for example, the U.S. Capitol Police and Library of Congress Police Merger Implementation Act)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "House of Representatives", "paragraphs": ["The House of Representatives has operated revolving funds for decades.
