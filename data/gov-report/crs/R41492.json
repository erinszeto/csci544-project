The Senate did not pass an FY2011 THUD appropriations bill; the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported out an FY2011 THUD appropriations bill (S. 3644) that recommended $122.8 billion (less than 1% over FY2010). In the absence of passage of a THUD appropriations act for FY2011, Congress has provided funding for the THUD agencies (and other government agencies) through a series of continuing resolutions (CRs).

With only a little over half of FY2011 left when the March 4 CR expired, and the budget request for FY2012 already submitted, debate over FY2011 appropriations shifted to the question of how much would be cut from the current total discretionary funding level. On February 18, 2011, the House passed H.R. 1, a bill to fund the government for the remainder of the fiscal year, which would have cut discretionary funding not only below the FY2011 requested level but also below the FY2010 enacted level. It would have provided $108.0 billion in total budgetary resources for THUD, 11% below the FY2010 enacted level. On March 9, 2011, the Senate considered, but failed to pass, both H.R. 1 and a Senate amendment to H.R. 1 (S.Amdt. 149) that would have cut total discretionary funding below the FY2011 request but left it above the FY2010 enacted level.

Both the FY2011 House and Senate bills in the 111th Congress would have provided a 5% increase over FY2010 in appropriations for HUD programs in aggregate.

Some witnesses attributed many of the incidents to driver error, and others suggested that, as software and electronic systems in vehicles grow increasingly complex, those systems may be subject to defects under rare combinations of factors, and thus are extremely difficult to detect. Congress questioned whether NHTSA's Office of Defect Investigation had sufficient electronic and software expertise to thoroughly investigate such possibilities.

These reductions would be accomplished through cuts to many HUD accounts. H.R. 1 would provide no new funding for the three accounts and one program for which FY2010 amounts would be rescinded. Additionally, no new funding would be provided for HUD's Housing Counseling Assistance program and the Native Hawaiian Block Grant program. The largest total dollar amount reduction would be made to the Community Development Fund, which funds a number of programs, the largest of which is the Community Development Block Grant program (CDBG).
