U.S. authorities encountered more than 52,000 unaccompanied minors from the region at the U.S. border in FY2014, a more than 1,200% increase compared to FY2011. This unexpected surge of children strained U.S. government resources and created a complex crisis with humanitarian implications. U.S. apprehensions of unaccompanied minors from the northern triangle declined by 45% in FY2015. They increased in the first five months of FY2016, however, and experts warn that significant migration flows will continue until policymakers in the countries of origin and the international community address the poor socioeconomic and security conditions driving Central Americans to leave their homes.", "The 2014 migration crisis led to renewed focus on Central America, a region with which the United States historically has shared close political, economic, and cultural ties. The United States engages with Central American countries through a variety of mechanisms, including a security assistance package known as the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) and the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR). Over the past two years, the Obama Administration has sought closer cooperation with Central American governments to dissuade children from making the journey to the United States, target smuggling networks, and repatriate unauthorized migrants.", "The Administration also has introduced a whole-of-government \"U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America\" designed to increase economic opportunity, reduce extreme violence, and strengthen the effectiveness of state institutions in the region. The Administration requested $1 billion through the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development to implement the strategy in FY2016, and it has requested more than $770 million through those two agencies to continue implementation in FY2017. The governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras are undertaking complementary efforts under their \"Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle.\"", "Congress has expressed considerable concern about increased migration from Central America, with Members holding numerous hearings, traveling to the region, and introducing legislation designed to address the situation. Although Congress opted not to appropriate supplemental funding for programs in Central America in FY2014, it appropriated more than $570 million for the region in FY2015, which was $241 million more than the Administration originally requested. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235), also directed the Administration to develop a comprehensive strategy to address the key factors contributing to the migration of unaccompanied children to the United States. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113), appropriated $750 million in support of the Administration's Central America strategy in FY2016. The act also placed a number of conditions on the assistance, requiring governments in the region to take steps to improve border security, combat corruption, increase revenues, and address human rights concerns, among other actions.", "As Congress debates the Administration's FY2017 budget request and other legislative options to address increased migration from Central America, it might take into consideration a variety of interrelated issues. These issues might include the humanitarian implications of the current situation, the international humanitarian response, Central American governments' limited capacities to receive and reintegrate repatriated children, Central American governments' abilities and willingness to address poor security and socioeconomic conditions in their countries, and the extent to which the Mexican government is capable of limiting the transmigration of Central Americans through its territory."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Over the past several years, the number of unaccompanied children from the \"northern triangle\" of Central America (El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras) attempting to enter the United States has increased significantly.

U.S. authorities noted similar increases in apprehensions of Central American families and single adults. Although the number of Central Americans reaching the U.S. border has declined since FY2014, U.S. apprehensions of unaccompanied children remain at elevated levels, placing strains on government resources and raising concerns domestically and internationally about the safety and protection of the children.", "There is little consensus among analysts regarding why the number of Central American minors abandoning their homes in hope of entering the United States has increased so significantly. Nevertheless, most analysts maintain that the problem is complex, involving interactions between so-called push factors , such as high levels of violence and poverty in Central America, and pull factors , such as the desire to join family members in the United States and perceptions about U.S. immigration policies. Many analysts warn that elevated levels of migration from the region are likely to continue until policymakers in the countries of origin and the international community address the poor security and socioeconomic conditions in the northern triangle.", "Members of Congress have expressed significant concerns about the influx of unaccompanied minors and have taken some steps designed to address the situation. This report focuses on the foreign policy dimensions of increased migration from Central America. It begins by examining U.S. policy in the region, including a brief historical background, the current policy framework, and the U.S. and regional response to the surge in unaccompanied minors. The report then discusses a variety of issues Congress might take into consideration as it continues to formulate policy toward Central America. These issues include the humanitarian implications of the migration situation, the international humanitarian response, the capacity of Central American nations to receive and reintegrate unaccompanied children removed (deported) from the United States, the capacity of Central American nations to address the root causes of the exodus, and the role of Mexico as a transit country.

During the Cold War, the U.S. government viewed links between the Soviet Union and leftist and nationalist political movements in Central America as a potential threat to U.S. strategic interests. The United States provided extensive assistance (equivalent to $9.7 billion constant 2013 dollars) to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras during the 1980s as the Salvadoran and Guatemalan governments fought leftist insurgencies and the Honduran government supported U.S. policy in the region. An estimated 70,000 Salvadorans and 200,000 Guatemalans were killed or \"disappeared\" during the countries' civil conflicts and truth commissions have determined that government forces were responsible for most of the human rights abuses committed. Many Central Americans fled the region and sought refuge in the United States. The vast majority of Salvadorans and Guatemalans were denied asylum, however, since the U.S. government insisted that its allies in the region were not responsible for human rights violations. During this time period, the United States also established the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI; formally the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act\u2014 P.L. 98-67 ) to support political and economic stability in Central America. This unilateral preferential trade arrangement, launched in 1983, provided duty-free access to the U.S. market for many goods from the region.", "U.S. support for Central America began to wane in the 1990s following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the region's civil conflicts. Peace accords were signed in El Salvador in 1992 and in Guatemala in 1996. Although the United States provided some support to Central American countries to strengthen democratic governance and implement market-oriented economic reforms and provided considerable assistance in the aftermath of natural disasters such as Hurricane Mitch in 1998, aid to the northern triangle countries declined significantly during the 1990s (see Figure 3 ).", "Following the passage of the Illegal Immigrant Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996, the United States accelerated deportations of Central Americans. Nearly 46,000 convicts were among those deported to the region between 1998 and 2005; they included members of the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and 18 th Street Gang (M-18), contributing to the spread of gang violence in Central America. Nevertheless, many Central Americans continued to migrate to the United States, primarily for economic reasons.", "Over the past decade, the U.S. government has sought to enhance security cooperation with the countries of the northern triangle to address high levels of crime and violence and the region's emergence as a major transit point for illicit narcotics destined for the United States. Although the Department of Defense has provided some assistance, much of this cooperation has taken place under the umbrella of the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) administered by the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). CARSI provides the seven nations of the Central American isthmus with equipment, training, and technical assistance to support law enforcement operations. CARSI is also designed to strengthen the long-term capacities of Central American governments to address security challenges and the underlying social and political factors that contribute to these challenges. Congress has appropriated nearly $1.5 billion for CARSI since its inception in FY2008. As the State Department and USAID dedicated larger portions of their limited foreign-assistance budgets for the region toward addressing security concerns, they reduced funding for more traditional development sectors, such as governance and economic reform. ", "While most U.S. agencies shifted the focus of their efforts in Central America toward security concerns, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) provided substantial infusions of economic aid to the region. In 2005, the MCC signed a five-year, $205 million compact to improve transportation infrastructure and support rural development in Honduras. Although the MCC Board decided not to renew the compact as a result of the Honduran government's poor performance on corruption, it approved a so-called threshold program of up to $15.6 million in 2013 to support Honduran government efforts to strengthen public financial management and increase the transparency and efficiency of public-private partnerships. In 2006, the MCC signed a five-year, $461 million compact to support development in the northern border region of El Salvador. A second five-year compact, finalized in 2014, is providing an additional $277 million to El Salvador to improve the country's investment climate, human capital, and infrastructure. Although Guatemala has yet to receive a compact, the MCC Board approved a $28 million threshold program for the country in 2014 to support fiscal reform, foster partnerships with the private sector, and improve linkages between the education system and the labor market.", "Trade and investment relations between the United States and the northern triangle countries are governed by the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), which was signed in 2004 and entered into force for El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras in 2006. The agreement builds on CBI by making preferential market access reciprocal, comprehensive, and permanent. Between 2005 and 2015, U.S. merchandise trade with the countries of the northern triangle increased by nearly 54%, growing from $16.8 billion to $25.8 billion. U.S. exports to the region have grown by 82%, and U.S. imports from the region have grown by 29%. Analysts had predicted that CAFTA-DR would lead to a relatively larger increase in U.S. exports because a significant portion of imports from the region already entered the United States duty free under CBI. The stock of U.S. direct investment in the northern triangle countries has also increased, climbing from $2.1 billion in 2005 to $4.7 billion in 2014. These trends vary somewhat by country. Honduras, for example, has seen a slight decline in the stock of U.S. direct investment over the past decade.", "There continue to be strong cultural ties between the United States and Central America. In 2014, the foreign-born populations from El Salvador (1.3 million), Guatemala (916,000), and Honduras (588,000) ranked as the 5 th - , 10 th - , and 16 th -largest groups, respectively, of all foreign-born groups in the United States. According to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) estimates, 55% of Salvadorans, 64% of Guatemalans, and 67% of Hondurans residing in the United States are in the country illegally. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) removed about 75,000 undocumented individuals from the northern triangle in FY2015, including 22,000 Salvadorans, 33,000 Guatemalans, and 20,000 Hondurans. Some Central Americans who may otherwise be deported have been allowed to stay in the United States with Temporary Protected Status (TPS). The U.S. government has continuously provided TPS to eligible Hondurans since 1998, when Hurricane Mitch struck Honduras, and to eligible Salvadorans since 2001, when El Salvador experienced a series of earthquakes.

The Administration has engaged in extensive diplomacy with the northern triangle governments, run public awareness campaigns in the region, increased anti-human smuggling operations, supported the Mexican government's immigration enforcement efforts, and established an in-country refugee processing program for Central American minors.

President Obama and Vice President Biden have also hosted the presidents of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras in Washington, DC, on several occasions.", "As a result of these diplomatic efforts, the northern triangle governments have undertaken efforts that have bolstered the U.S. response. They have run public awareness campaigns warning their citizens about the dangers of traveling to the United States irregularly and increased their efforts to combat human smuggling. They also joined together to draft the \"Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle,\" which is designed to address the underlying factors contributing to migration by fostering economic growth, increasing education and employment opportunities, improving security conditions, and strengthening government institutions in the region. During a February 2016 meeting in Washington, DC, with Vice President Biden, Presidents Sanchez Cer\u00e9n of El Salvador, Jimmy Morales of Guatemala, and Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez of Honduras reviewed key accomplishments from the past year and committed to taking additional actions to further the plan in 2016.

The President and other officials have warned Central Americans about the dangers involved in irregular migration to the United States, and have sought to correct possible misperceptions about U.S. immigration policies. In 2014, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) launched the \"Dangers Awareness Campaign,\" which included media outreach in metropolitan areas of the United States that have high concentrations of Central American immigrants, as well as billboards and public service announcements in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Nearly 6,400 radio and television announcements aired in the northern triangle during the campaign, which ran from June 30 to October 12, 2014. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) joined with the State Department to launch the \"Executive Action on Immigration: Know the Facts\" awareness campaign in January 2015. It included print, radio, and television announcements designed to explain U.S. immigration policies and dispel potential misinformation. The campaign was stopped in mid-February 2015, however, after a federal court ruling halted implementation of the President's executive actions on immigration.", "Although DHS and the State Department did not conduct evaluations to measure the effectiveness of the 2014 and 2015 public awareness campaigns, a recent study calls into question the ability of such campaigns to deter migration. Analyzing polling data from the region, the study found that citizens of the northern triangle are well aware that irregular migration to the United States was dangerous and unlikely to succeed. It also found that knowledge of the journey's dangers and U.S. deportation policies had no impact on individuals' intentions to migrate. The study found that those who have been victimized by crime more than once in the past year are nearly twice as likely to report that they intend to migrate as those who have not been victimized. These findings suggest that immediate concerns outweigh hypothetical dangers and challenges in migration decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Anti-Human Smuggling Operations", "paragraphs": ["The Obama Administration has also intensified its efforts to target and dismantle human smuggling operations.

Building on initial investigative accomplishments, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) expanded the initiative in March 2015 with \"Operation Coyote 2.0.\" The operation resulted in 876 criminal arrests, 690 indictments, and 612 convictions related to human smuggling in FY2015.", "Some security analysts maintain that anti-smuggling operations are unlikely to have a significant impact on migration flows in the long run. These analysts assert that because smuggling will remain a high-demand and lucrative business as long as people want to migrate, other organized criminal groups or illicit actors will step in to fill the void left by dismantled networks.

As of February 2016, the State Department had delivered $20 million of assistance for Mexico's southern border region, mostly in the form of nonintrusive inspection equipment, mobile kiosks, canine teams, and training in immigration enforcement. Additional funding will support a biometrics system and a secure communications network for Mexican agencies in the southern border region, among other projects. The U.S. government may provide further support for these efforts using a portion of the roughly $139 million in M\u00e9rida aid appropriated for Mexico in FY2016 and $129 million in M\u00e9rida aid requested in FY2017.", "The Mexican government's implementation of the U.S.-backed Southern Border Plan has coincided with a sharp increase in apprehensions and deportations of Central Americans.

During the same time period, U.S. apprehensions of northern triangle nationals fell from 239,000 to fewer than 135,000. These figures suggest that migration outflows from Central America remained fairly stable throughout FY2015, but fewer migrants reached the U.S. border as a result of increased apprehensions by Mexican authorities. Human rights advocates have voiced concerns regarding Mexico's Southern Border Plan, asserting that it has led migrants to take more dangerous routes that expose them to new vulnerabilities and hinder their access to shelters and humanitarian assistance.

This corruption and impunity has occurred partially as a result of incomplete institutional reforms implemented after armed conflicts ended in El Salvador and Guatemala in the 1990s. Criminal groups' efforts to influence public officials and elections, particularly at the local level, have also contributed to corruption. In 2015, Guatemala's attorney general, with support from the U.N. Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), uncovered massive corruption in the customs and social security systems.

Although those initiatives likely have deterred some potential migrants, the Mexican government's increased immigration enforcement efforts under the U.S.-backed Southern Border Plan appear to have played the most significant role in preventing Central Americans from reaching the U.S. border. Mexico's increased enforcement efforts have also raised humanitarian concerns, however, as they have pushed migrants to take more dangerous routes to the United States and the M exican government has less capacity than the U.S. government to screen migrants for protection concerns. Moreover, the recent increase in U.S. apprehensions suggests that the initial reductions achieved with Mexico's Southern Border Plan may not be sustainable.", "Given the Administration's intention to push forward with deportations of unaccompanied minors who have not been granted asylum, strengthening Central American nations' capacities to receive and reintegrate deportees is another major focus of the short-term policy response. The U.S. government has provided some assistance to support such efforts, and various international organizations are offering additional assistance to northern triangle governments as they expand services for repatriated citizens. Nevertheless, reports that some minors have faced persecution and even death upon their return to Central America raise questions as to whether governments in the region will be able to provide adequate attention and protection for a new influx of deportees.", "Many analysts think the United States is likely to continue to receive significant mixed migration flows of refugees, asylum-seekers, and migrants until citizen security and socioeconomic opportunities for citizens of the northern triangle improve substantially. The Obama Administration has echoed this assessment and introduced a new, whole-of-government U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America to promote economic prosperity, strengthen governance, and improve security in the region. Congress appropriated $750 million in assistance to support implementation of the strategy in FY2016. Improving security and socioeconomic conditions in Central America will be a long-term and difficult endeavor, however, and likely will require extensive international support over an extended period of time. ", "While many analysts maintain that Central American nations will require external support to address their challenges, they acknowledge that significant improvements in security and socioeconomic conditions in the region ultimately will depend on Central American leaders carrying out substantial internal reforms. Northern triangle nations will need to raise revenues, reduce corruption, strengthen institutions, and expand educational and economic opportunities. Leaders in the region have committed to such reforms as part of their Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle, and Congress has provided additional incentives to implement those reforms by placing stringent conditions on U.S. assistance. As Members of Congress consider additional assistance for the region, they are likely to closely track the progress made by the northern triangle governments, recognizing that U.S. initiatives will likely fail to produce their desired results unless the region's leaders follow through on their commitments."], "subsections": []}]}}
