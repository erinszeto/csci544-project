It was initially under the control of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, a civilian agency within the Executive Office of the President. In 1942, control shifted to the Army, in substantial part because the Army had the capability to manage projects to design and build the massive plants to produce uranium and plutonium for atomic bombs. In 1945 and 1946, debate raged in Congress, the White House, the War Department, and among scientists and the public about whether to place atomic energy under civilian or military control. Congress resolved the issue in favor of civilian control of atomic energy in the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (P.L. 79-585). That act created the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to develop nuclear weapons and, more generally, to foster and control research into atomic energy. The AEC was an independent organization, separate from the War Department and, later, from the Department of Defense (DOD). Ever since, nuclear weapons R&D has been conducted by the AEC and its successor organizations, all of which have been under civilian control and separate from DOD.", "The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (P.L. 83-703), as amended, replaces the Atomic Energy Act of 1946.

The PLA's Second Artillery (missile force) deploys nuclear-armed and conventionally armed missiles for strategic deterrence and manages the storage and security of nuclear weapons. The nuclear weapons work is conducted by the China Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP), which refers to a large organization that encompasses at least 17 major research institutes located near the cities of Mianyang (Sichuan province), Shanghai, Beijing, and Chengdu. Founded in 1958, the CAEP has used names of entities that include the Ninth Academy, High Power Laser Laboratory, and Institute of Applied Physics and Computational Mathematics (IAPCM). CAEP seems to report to the Science and Technology Commission of the PLA's General Armaments Department (GAD). The PLA, through the GAD, also controls the nuclear weapon testing base at Lop Nur in the northwestern Xinjiang region. The PRC's last announced nuclear weapons test took place in July 1996. ", "At the same time, the PRC has a policy of military-civilian integration in national defense, including work at military and civilian institutes and universities. Under the Central Military Commission (CMC) and the State Council, the Central Special Commission is believed to be responsible for top-level coordination of strategic weapons programs. Other PRC organizations reportedly involved with nuclear warheads reportedly include the following: Northwest Institute of Nuclear Technology, Fudan University, Shanghai Institute of Nuclear Research, China Institute of Atomic Energy, China Institute of Radiation Protection, China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), China Academy of Sciences (CAS), and China Academy of Engineering (CAE). The China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) is a defense industrial state-owned conglomerate that works with nuclear fuel, nuclear power plants, enrichment, and other related nuclear activities. In 2008, CNNC was re-organized as one of 10 defense industrial conglomerates under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). ", "The PRC is believed to possess a nuclear force that totals approximately 240 nuclear warheads, according to some experts. They also say that satellite images and other data suggest that China's nuclear production facilities are not producing more plutonium and do not have enough fissile material for thousands of warheads. Still, uncertainty remains about China's nuclear weapons. The PLA's Second Artillery reportedly uses an extensive network of underground tunnels, totaling over 3,100 miles, to hide and move strategic missiles, as the Secretary of Defense reported to Congress in 2011. In 2011, Professor Phillip Karber of Georgetown University focused on the tunnels and argued in a study that China's nuclear weapons could total as many as 3,000. A retired general who commanded Russia's strategic forces, Viktor Yesin, argued that China has 1,600-1,800 nuclear warheads. However, in August 2012, the Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM), Air Force General Robert Kehler, said that he disagreed with arguments that China has hundreds or thousands more nuclear weapons than the size estimated by intelligence assessments.

Its officials simply state that Israel would not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into the region, without explaining what that means. Israel has followed this policy for more than four decades in the apparent hopes of deterring adversaries without triggering widespread regional proliferation. Therefore, the Office of the Military Censor disallows any reporting on the country's nuclear infrastructure, facilities, and organizations that implies the existence of a nuclear weapons program. Nonetheless, there have been many international reports alleging and concerning Israel's nuclear weapons program. Indeed, as far back as 1974, a U.S. Special National Intelligence Estimate stated, \"We believe that Israel already has produced and stockpiled a small number of fission weapons.\"", "Israel's nuclear program is under civilian control. In 1952, the Israel Atomic Energy Commission (IAEC) was created to advise the government on nuclear policy and on nuclear research and development priorities, as well as to implement policies and conduct research. Between 1957 and 1966, during the development of the nuclear site near Dimona in the Negev, Shimon Peres, then director general of the defense ministry (and now Israel's president), diminished the IAEC's role by giving authority over the nuclear project to two new organizations within the defense ministry that reported directly to him. ", "A restructured IAEC resurfaced in 1966, shortly after Peres's departure from the defense ministry. At that point, the IAEC reportedly assumed overall responsibility for Israel's nuclear weapons program. The director general of the IAEC officially reports directly to the prime minister, who is the ex-officio chairman of the organization. Like the Mossad (Institute for Intelligence and Special Operations)\u2014another secretive Israeli organization under the prime minister's responsibility\u2014the IAEC and its activities are not codified in Israeli law. In 2007, the IAEC established a website that includes some basic unclassified information on Israel's nuclear program, without referring to any military aspects of the program. Such aspects remain classified. In August 2007, then Prime Minister Ehud Olmert named Dr. Shaul Horev (alternate transliteration: Chorev), formerly deputy chief of the Israeli navy and then head of a secret \"special means\" division within the defense ministry, to be the IAEC director general. According to a 2010 book by a U.S.-based Israeli academic specializing in Israel's nuclear history, the defense ministry reportedly plays a substantial but publicly undisclosed role in steering the program, largely due to its control over \"key aspects of the IAEC's operations, such as budget and security.\" The 2010 book characterizes the IAEC as, in some respects, Israel's most secretive security organization.", "The IAEC directs research at the Center for Nuclear Research at Nahal Sorek (alternative transliteration: Soreq), approximately 10 miles south of Tel Aviv, and at the larger Center for Nuclear Research in the Negev south of Dimona. The Sorek center has a small civilian research reactor under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards. According to some reports, Sorek also conducts nuclear weapons research and design activities. Dimona is the site of a reactor and fissile material processing plant that is off-limits to international inspectors, and reportedly both highly enriched uranium (HEU) and plutonium are produced there. ", "In March 2012, Israeli officials announced plans to phase out the civilian reactor at Sorek by 2018, largely because the reactor's stock of HEU fuel\u2014provided by the United States in 1960\u2014is running out and the reactor is aging. Nuclear Suppliers Group guidelines prohibit suppliers from exporting additional reactor fuel to Israel because the country is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Israel will reportedly replace the reactor with a particle accelerator that will fulfill many of the same research and medical functions.
