For each fiscal year, FY2001-FY2015, a random sample of 25 Senators' offices was taken for each position. In order to be included, Senate staff had to hold a position with the same job title in the Senator's office for the entire fiscal year examined, and not receive pay from any other congressional employing authority. For some positions, it was not possible to identify 25 offices that employed staff for an entire year. In circumstances when data for 14 or fewer staff were identified for a position, this report provides no data. Every recorded payment ascribed in the LegiStorm data to those staff for the fiscal year is included. Data collected for this report may differ from an employee's stated annual salary due to the inclusion of overtime, bonuses, or other payments in addition to base salary paid in the course of a year.

The periods of time covered by the Report of the Secretary of the Senate overlap the end of one Congress and convening of the next. This report provides no data for first-term Senators in the first nine months of their service. Pay data provide no insight into the education, work experience, position tenure, full- or part-time status of staff, or other potential explanations for levels of compensation. Staff could be based in Washington, DC, state offices, or both. Potential differences might exist in the job duties of positions with the same title. Aggregation of pay by job title rests on the assumption that staff with the same title carry out the same or similar tasks. Given the wide discretion congressional employing authorities have in setting the terms and conditions of employment, there may be differences in the duties of similarly titled staff that could have effects on their levels of pay.
