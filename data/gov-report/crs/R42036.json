Some Members of Congress have argued that Congress should not consider other reforms to the immigration system, including any proposed legalization provisions or changes to the family- or employment-based visas systems, until DHS is better able to secure the border. With apprehensions of unauthorized immigrants at a 42-year low, administration officials have argued that significant progress has been made at the border, though continued investments are needed.

Three hundred additional CBP officers were funded during the FY2012 appropriations process, and several other bills that would address additional POE staffing increases have been considered in the 112 th Congress. For example, the Secure Border Act of 2012 ( H.R. 1299 ), passed by the House in May 2012, would direct DHS to develop metrics to measure security at ports of entry and to estimate the required number of CBP officers at POEs. The Department of Homeland Security Authorization (DHSA) Act of 2011 ( S. 1546 ), as reported by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, would direct DHS to develop a workforce staffing model and to ensure that CBP has instituted an outbound inspections program at land, air, and maritime ports of entry."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Entry-Exit Screening", "paragraphs": ["The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-208 , Div.

DHS's primary effort to provide such an integrated surveillance system between 2006 and 2011 was known as SBInet.

The verification requirements with respect to hiring would be phased in by employer size, with the largest employers required to participate six months after the date of enactment and the smallest employers required to participate two years after the date of enactment. The requirements with respect to recruitment and referral would apply one year after the date of enactment.

This concept of birthright citizenship is codified in the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and \u00a7301(a) of the INA. The war on terror and the case of Yaser Esam Hamdi, a U.S.-Saudi dual national captured in Afghanistan fighting with Taliban forces, further heightened attention to and interest in restricting automatic birthright citizenship. Although Hamdi's parents were Saudi nationals in the United States on nonimmigrant work visas, Hamdi was a U.S. citizen by right of his birth in Louisiana and arguably entitled to rights not available to foreign enemy combatants. ", "In the 112 th Congress, some Members have supported introducing legislation that would revise or reinterpret the Citizenship Clause to address concerns that (1) children born to unauthorized aliens become an avenue to legal status for their parents and siblings when they turn 21 years old, and (2) affluent pregnant foreigners come to the United States on tourist visas to give birth to their children and thus provide them with U.S. citizenship. Several bills have been introduced to amend the Constitution and/or the INA to exclude persons born in the United States from citizenship at birth if their parents were unlawfully present in the United States or were nonimmigrant aliens. In order for a child to be a citizen at birth under these proposals, at least one parent would have to be a U.S. national, an LPR who resides in the United States, or an alien serving on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces.", "Furthermore, some state legislators have voiced support for state legislation that would define state citizenship as excluding persons born to undocumented aliens and for a state compact under which states would issue a different type of birth certificate to such persons. State legislators from Arizona and 13 other states unveiled model legislation in January 2011, intending to set the stage for a U.S. Supreme Court review of the Citizenship Clause. Such legislation has been introduced in some states but has not been enacted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands", "paragraphs": ["Title VII of P.L. 110-229 made the INA applicable to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), a U.S. territory in the Pacific. Previously, in accordance with an agreement known as the Covenant that sets forth the relationship between the CNMI and the United States, the CNMI had not been subject to U.S. immigration law. Among other provisions, P.L. 110-229 established a transition period for implementing the INA in the CNMI that began on November 28, 2009. It aimed, in particular, to provide federal regulation and oversight of the admission of foreign workers to the CNMI, including by establishing a CNMI-only transitional worker visa. Aliens who were not eligible for the transitional foreign worker visas were able to remain in the CNMI on entry permits issued under the former territorial immigration laws until the earlier of the original permit expiration date or November 28, 2011. ", "In the 112 th Congress, H.R. 1466 would resolve the status of certain long-term foreign residents of the CNMI who otherwise may not be able to remain in the territory after November 28, 2011. The bill was reported by the House Natural Resources Committee, while the House Judiciary Committee discharged it without a report. Some long-term foreign residents of the CNMI have U.S. citizen spouses and children who, for various reasons, are unable to sponsor them for U.S. immigrant status. For example, some have U.S. citizen spouses and adult sons or daughters who are eligible to file a family-based immigrant petition on their behalf; however, due to the economic conditions in the CNMI, many citizens apparently are unable to satisfy the requisite household income level for sponsoring a relative as an immigrant under U.S. law. Other long-term foreign residents were granted permanent resident status in the CNMI under former territorial immigration laws, but this status will no longer be valid under federal immigration law after November 28, 2011. Still other persons who were born in the CNMI were not eligible for U.S. citizenship under the terms of the Covenant. As reported, H.R. 1466 would authorize admission of these various long-term foreign residents, subject to certain requirements, as immigrants to the CNMI only, and provide a path for most of these CNMI-only residents to adjust later to regular LPR status.", "On November 23, 2011, USCIS announced that certain prospective beneficiaries of H.R. 1466 , namely immediate relatives of U.S. citizens and certain persons born in the CNMI who did not receive U.S. citizenship (also their spouses and unmarried children under 21 years old), would be eligible for parole. Parole would be granted on a case-by-case, discretionary basis and would permit recipients to stay lawfully in the CNMI. On December 9, 2011, USCIS issued guidelines clarifying that a grant of parole based on an application filed on or before January 31, 2012, would be backdated to November 27, 2011. If parole is denied, unlawful presence would accrue after the expiration of the CNMI permit on November 27, 2011. A grant of parole based on an application filed after January 31, 2012, would be valid from the date of grant, so unlawful presence would accrue after the expiration of the CNMI permit on November 27, 2011, until the date for the grant of parole. The maximum grant would be until December 31, 2012. In the meantime, discussions about H.R. 1466 continue, with some critics seeking to remove or limit the fourth group of beneficiaries in the current bill (foreign parents of minor U.S. citizen children) and some supporters pushing to extend the benefits of H.R. 1466 to other groups of long-term foreign workers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Professional Foreign Temporary Employees", "paragraphs": ["The 112 th Congress is taking renewed interest in foreign temporary workers engaged in professional occupations.
