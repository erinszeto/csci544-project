IHS is organized into 12 Areas administered by an Area Office; Areas, in turn, are further subdivided into service units. IHS may provide services directly, or Indian tribes (ITs) or tribal organizations (TOs) may operate IHS facilities and programs themselves through self-determination contracts and self-governance compacts negotiated with IHS. Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs) also provide services using contracts and grants from IHS. ", "IHCIA authorizes many specific IHS activities, sets out the national policy for health services administered to Indians, and states the federal goal for the health condition of the IHS service population, which is to \"assure the highest possible health status for Indians and urban Indians.\" Significantly, IHCIA also authorizes direct collections from Medicare, Medicaid, and other third party insurers. IHCIA also gives IHS authority to grant funding to urban Indian organizations to provide health care services to urban Indians, and establishes substance abuse treatment programs, Indian health professions recruitment programs, and many other programs. The IHCIA was last fully reauthorized by the Indian Health Amendments of 1992, which extended authorizations of its appropriations through FY2000. In 2000, all IHCIA appropriations authorizations were extended through FY2001. Congress has continued to appropriate funds for IHCIA programs since 2001. IHCIA reauthorization has been under consideration in Congress since 1999. In the current Congress, IHCIA reauthorization bills were introduced in the House ( H.R. 2708 ) and the Senate ( S. 1790 ).", "Another act, the Snyder Act of 1921, provides an additional, but very general, authorization for Indian health programs. The Snyder Act is a permanent, indefinite authorization for federal Indian programs, including for \"conservation of health.\" In 1921, all Indian programs, including health, were under the management of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in the Department of the Interior (Interior). The Snyder Act was passed in order to authorize all the activities the BIA was then carrying out. The act's broad language might be read as authorizing\u2014although not requiring\u2014nearly any Indian program, including health care, for which Congress enacts appropriations. The act, however, gives no directions or policies for federal Indian health care. When Congress transferred Indian health care programs from the BIA to the Public Health Service (PHS) in the then-Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (predecessor to the Department Health and Human Services (HHS)) in 1954, the Snyder Act's authorization accompanied the transfer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overview of Report", "paragraphs": ["The Affordable Health Care for America Act ( H.R. 3962 ), as passed on November 7, 2009, would make sweeping reforms of the U.S. health insurance and health care system.
