The country's king stepped down in 2006, and two years later Nepal declared itself a republic, electing a Constituent Assembly (CA) in 2008 to write a new constitution. A second CA elected in 2013 reached agreement on a new constitution in September 2015. Though the process of democratization begun in 2006 has had setbacks and has been marked by violence, Nepal has conducted reasonably peaceful elections, brought former insurgents into the political system, and, in a broad sense, taken several large steps toward establishing a functioning democracy.", "New provincial demarcations contained in the new constitution, along with other provisions, have met with opposition by the minority Madhese people of the lowland Terai border region with India. This has led to violent protests and disruptions to cross-border trade that have led to economic hardship and fuel shortages in Nepal. Kathmandu has asserted that the Indian government is playing a role in this unrest. Some media coverage described this as an unofficial blockade of Nepal. In part as a result of these developments, Nepal is seeking closer energy and trade linkages with China.", "Among the drivers of congressional interest in Nepal are the country's still-unfolding democratization process, geopolitical and humanitarian concerns, and its location as a landlocked state situated between India and China. The United States and Nepal established diplomatic ties in 1948 and relations between the two countries are friendly. U.S. policy objectives toward Nepal include supporting democratic institutions and economic liberalization, promoting peace and stability in South Asia, supporting Nepalese territorial integrity, alleviating poverty, and promoting development.", "Nepal's status as a relatively small, landlocked buffer state situated between India and China largely defines the context of its foreign policy. This geopolitical dynamic is changing somewhat as Nepal appears to be the site of more intense diplomatic and economic activity by both India and China. Historically, Nepal's ties with India have been closer than its ties with China. Recent developments in the Terai, however, have encouraged Nepal to seek closer relations with China. China is developing trade, transport and development linkages with Nepal and has reportedly pressured Nepal to constrain the activities of Tibetan refugees in Nepal.", "Nepal was devastated by a massive 7.8 magnitude earthquake on April 25, 2015. The disaster killed over 8,000 and destroyed much of Nepal's housing and infrastructure. By one estimate, over half a million homes were destroyed. Reconstruction costs are estimated by some at $7 billion. The devastation wrought by the earthquake is compounded by economic hardship stemming from the ongoing discontent in the Terai. An international donors conference held in June 2015 led to significant pledges of assistance to help Nepal rebuild.", "Nepal faces other challenges, as well as potential opportunities.

Most of those killed were in the Terai. This recent violence stems from a regionally-based, socio-political cleavage in Nepali society between the Madhese and Tharu people of the Terai and \"hill\" or Pahadi people who have traditionally held power in Nepal. The Madhese of the lowland Terai region that spans the southern border with India have expressed discontent with the political status quo for some time. Political agitation and violence in the Terai in 2007-2008 led to negotiations with the government to address discrimination against people from the Terai. ", "According to some reports, strikes by Madhese and police curfews in the Terai have significantly restricted trade across the border with India. The state-owned Indian Oil Corporation also reportedly was instructed not to refuel Nepalese tankers. This has led to severe fuel shortages in Nepal, which Kathmandu has blamed on India. New Delhi denies imposing an unofficial blockade to force changes in Nepal's constitution that would be more favorable for the Madhese, who traditionally have closer ties to India than the rest of Nepal. India did seal the border for 13 months in 1988-1989. The Government of Nepal has responded to the fuel shortage by seeking to reduce its dependence on India and gain greater access to fuel from China. On October 28, 2015, Nepal signed a Memorandum of Understanding with China to import petroleum products from China, which has the potential to end India's monopoly and thereby reduce somewhat India's leverage over Nepal. Transport linkages between Nepal and China are limited at present.

One concern with this approach is that it could exacerbate divisions within Nepali society by accentuating subnational ethnic, regional, and linguistic identities over identification with the overall state of Nepal. One lesson that disaffected groups may have learned from the Maoist experience is that armed insurrection can be translated into political leverage.

A transition from strict rule by the king to constitutional monarchy began in 1959, when then-King Mahendra issued a new constitution and held the country's first democratic elections. In 1960, however, the king declared the parliamentary system a failure, dismissed the fledgling government, suspended the constitution, and established a party-less system of rule under the monarchy. Although officially banned, political parties continued to operate and to agitate for a return to constitutional democracy.", "In February 1990, student groups and the major political parties launched the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy. The centrist Nepali Congress (NC) party joined with the leftist parties to hold peaceful demonstrations in Nepal's urban centers. Two months later, after more than 50 people were killed when police fired on a crowd of demonstrators, then-King Birendra turned power over to an interim government. This government drafted a constitution in November 1990, establishing Nepal as a parliamentary democracy with a constitutional monarch as head of state. The king at that time retained limited powers, including the right to declare a state of emergency with the approval of a two-thirds majority of parliament.", "In 1996, the leaders of the underground Communist Party of Nepal Maoist (CPN-M) launched a \"People's War\" in the mid-western region of Nepal, with the aim of replacing the constitutional monarchy with a one-party communist regime. The uprising appears to have been fueled by widespread perceptions of government corruption and failure to improve the quality of life of citizens, including providing access to cultivable land. The Maoists ran a parallel government, established their own tax system, burned land records, and redistributed seized property and food to the poor in 45 districts. The insurgency was waged in part through torture, killings, and bombings targeting police, the military, and public officials. A number of bank robberies, combined with \"revolutionary tax\" revenue, made the Nepali Maoists one of the wealthiest rebel groups in Asia.", "The Kathmandu government faced additional turmoil in June 2001, when Crown Prince Dipendra shot and killed his parents, King Birendra and Queen Aishwarya; seven other members of the royal family; and himself, reportedly after a disagreement over whom he should marry. This incident did much to undermine the legitimacy of the monarchy. King Gyanendra, the former king's brother, was crowned on June 4, 2001, and he appointed a commission to investigate the assassinations. By mid-June, the country began returning to normal following rioting and widespread refusal to believe official accounts of the massacre. In July 2001, then-Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala stepped down amid fears of continuing instability and his government's failure to deal with the growing Maoist insurgency.

The crisis began in late May, when King Gyanendra dissolved parliament and unilaterally declared a three-month extension of emergency rule, which had expired. The Prime Minister, who also scheduled early elections for November 2002, reportedly took such action after his centrist Nepali Congress party refused to support his plan to extend emergency rule. Following his actions, 56 former members of Parliament filed a lawsuit against him, claiming there was no constitutional precedent for the dissolution of parliament during emergency rule. In August 2002, the Supreme Court rejected this lawsuit. Although opponents of the Prime Minister agreed to accept the verdict, they emphasized the difficulty of holding free and fair elections two years ahead of schedule when much of the country was then under either rebel or army control.", "Although the prime minister pledged that there would be no emergency rule during the scheduled November 2002 elections, Maoist attacks and threatened strikes prompted the government to consider various measures to prevent a Maoist disruption of the polls. The government discussed imposing a partial state of emergency in areas most affected by the insurgency. However, opposition parties, which urged the government to open a dialogue with the Maoists, argued that by curbing civil liberties, emergency rule would inhibit free and fair elections. As an alternative, the government announced in September 2002 that it would hold the elections in six stages over two months, starting in mid-November, so that government troops could be transferred around the country to protect voters and candidates. After further deliberation, however, Nepal's cabinet concluded that the security situation was too risky to hold elections. On October 3, 2002, the cabinet asked King Gyanendra to postpone the national elections for one year.

The Maoists favored drafting a new constitution that would abolish the monarchy. The king opposed such a move and wanted the Maoists to relinquish their weapons. Accommodation between the monarchy and opposition democratic elements was widely seen as a key to creating the unified front necessary to defeat the Maoists. With his direct assumption of powers, and arrest of opposition democratic elements, the king decided to try defeating the Maoists without political support. This move proved to be the beginning of the end of the power of the monarchy in Nepal.", "After seizing direct power in early 2005, King Gyanendra exerted control over democratic elements, but made little progress in the struggle against the Maoists. The king reportedly thought he could take advantage of a split in the Maoist leadership and disarray amongst democrats to seize control and use the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) to defeat the Maoists. The seizure of power by the king appears to have been aimed as much, if not more so, at asserting the king's control over democratic forces.

By some estimates, almost half of the RNA was occupied with palace security, civil administration, and efforts to restrict communications and civil rights.

"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Nepal-India Relations", "paragraphs": ["India and Nepal have a tradition of close cooperation in the area of defense and foreign affairs. Nepal also is heavily dependent on India as the primary source of imports, its main market for exports, and for access to the sea through the port of Kolkata. A significant percentage of all foreign investment in Nepal also comes from India. Moreover, the Himalayan mountain range along Nepal's northern border limits access to China, whereas the 500-mile southern plains border with India is relatively open. Some sectors of the Nepali leadership have reportedly long resented Indian economic influence and have sought to establish a more independent foreign policy, which could draw Nepal closer to China. Kathmandu has at times sought to counterbalance what it considers undue pressure from India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's state visit to Kathmandu in August 2014 was the first by an Indian prime minister in 17 years. The two countries agreed to refresh their bilateral Treaty of Peace and Friendship and India plans to extend $1 billion in concessionary loans to Nepal to develop hydropower and infrastructure. India pledged $1 billion in additional assistance for reconstruction in Nepal following the 2015 earthquake. ", "It is not entirely clear to what extent if at all India orchestrated a blockade of energy supplies to Nepal. India reportedly sought to influence Nepal to alter its new constitution to take into account the interests of the Tharu and Madhese of the Terai. To some observers it appears that India will have to change its policy if it wishes to remove incentives for Nepal to seek to further develop its energy, trade, and other linkages with China. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, the fuel agreement between Nepal and China could \"end India's position as holding a monopoly on fuel supplies and enhance China's influence in Nepal, altering the regional balance of power.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nepal-China Relations", "paragraphs": ["China has in recent years made significant inroads in developing ties with South Asian and Indian Ocean littoral states. Some view this engagement as predominantly being economically driven, while others, particularly analysts in New Delhi who follow strategic issues, increasingly view Chinese activity with geopolitical alarm. China promised $483 million in post-earthquake assistance to Nepal at the donors conference in June 2015. China reportedly has plans to extend the Qinghai-Llasa railway line to Kathmandu, though some have challenged the technical feasibility of the plans. As discussed above, Nepal has been a transit country for Tibetans seeking to flee Chinese repression in Tibet. Most of those entering Nepal from Tibet move on to settle in India. The Government of Nepal closely monitors Tibetan refugees, restricts their freedom of assembly and expression, and enforces restrictions that make it difficult for Tibetans to obtain documents necessary for access to public services.
