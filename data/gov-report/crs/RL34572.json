These phthalates are not tightly held by the plastics and are released into the environment over time. Congress is concerned about possible human health effects from exposure to six of these chemicals: di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), diisononyl phthalate (DINP), diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP), and di-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP). DEHP, DBP, BBP, and (to less extent) DINP are known to be toxic to the reproductive systems of rodents. Recent rodent experiments demonstrate that pre-natal exposure at a sufficient level to these same phthalates disrupts the normal action of hormones and can cause malformations of the reproductive organs of offspring (especially males).", "Disruption of hormonal functions in humans is known to result in abnormal reproductive development. Many scientists believe that the phthalates toxic to rodents might be able to cause similar malformations in humans. However, human health effects of phthalate exposure have not been conclusively demonstrated. Very few studies have looked at possible effects in humans, but their results appear consistent with the results of rodent experiments. More research would be needed to test this hypothesis. Recent U.S. surveys have found almost universal human exposure to phthalates. Individuals may be exposed to high enough levels of phthalates to cause reproductive abnormalities. Scientists at the National Toxicology Program have expressed \"serious concern\" about human male infants undergoing intensive medical procedures, and \"concern\" about development of human males less than a year old who are exposed to DEHP. In light of these concerns, the National Academy of Sciences is evaluating the risk of aggregate human exposure to multiple phthalates.", "Federal agencies have taken several actions, some as early as the mid 1980s, to evaluate and regulate phthalates, but no consumer product to date has been banned outright. The agency responsible for regulating toys and most other child-care products is the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-314, enacted August 14, 2008) includes a provision intended to ensure protection of children from six phthalates by restricting their use in toys and child-care products.", "The scientific basis for concerns about human health risks appears to be strong in the case of some phthalates (such as DEHP), adequate with respect to others (perhaps DINP), and weak for the remaining chemicals (for example, DIDP and DnOP). The strongest evidence with respect to developmental effects has been produced since about the year 2000. The new law codifies voluntary agreements previously reached by CPSC with product manufacturers, and should reduce exposure to one particular phthalate.

The most common use of phthalates is to increase the flexibility of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) polymers. Phthalates are released from those products over time, and are dispersed to the air, water, soil, and living things. Some (but not all) of these phthalates are known to cause reproductive damage in rodents. Recent interest by governmental bodies, including Congress, in the potential adverse human health effects that might be related to phthalate exposure has focused on six phthalates that are produced and used in very large quantities. The six phthalates are di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), diisononyl phthalate (DINP), diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP), and di-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP). Newly enacted P.L. 110 - 314 , the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA), prohibits the sale of children's toys and child care articles that contain more than 0.1% of DEHP, DBP, or BBP.

However, controlled experiments with rodents have demonstrated that some phthalates at high doses damage reproduction and development. Moreover, if administered at sufficient levels and at the appropriate time to pregnant females, some phthalates can cause malformations of the reproductive organs of offspring, especially males. In rats, exposure during gestation to some phthalates can cause testicular cancer in mature offspring. The higher the phthalate exposure, the more frequent and severe are the effects on the reproductive system. Rat fetuses are most susceptible, but older rats can also be affected at somewhat higher levels of exposure.", "Disruption of hormonal functions in humans is known to result in abnormal reproductive development. Many scientists believe that the phthalates toxic to rats and mice might be able to cause similar malformations in humans, because the male hormones affected by phthalates are important to the normal development of the male reproductive tract in all species of mammals. However, human health effects of phthalate exposure have not been conclusively demonstrated. Very few studies have looked at possible effects in humans, but their results have been consistent with the results of rodent experiments. A study published in 2005 provided the first evidence of subtle developmental effects, similar to those seen in animal studies, in human male infants exposed prenatally to breakdown products of phthalates.

Children also are more exposed to DnOP, but these exposures appear to be lower than those for DEHP, di-n-butyl phthalate, and BBP. Levels of a breakdown product of DINP were not detectable in children surveyed (but see section below on DINP) and DIDP was not measured in 2001-2002.

According to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), food probably is the major source of exposure to some phthalates for the general population. However, air also appears to be important. For the human fetus, maternal exposure leads to prenatal exposure through the placenta. Personal care items, including baby lotion and powder, may be significant sources of exposure for infants. For some individuals, certain medications also may be important sources. Finally, medical devices may dominate exposure sources for critically ill patients. Individuals, such as newborns in intensive care, may be exposed to levels of DEHP much closer to, but still less than 1% of, levels that cause reproductive harm in rats.", "Phthalates do not bioaccumulate in the body or the environment; rather they break down rapidly.

Of particular note is the study by Lehmann et al. (2004). It established the relationship between exposure to DBP and effects on synthesis of testosterone in fetal male rats.

However, effects were seen only at high levels of BBP exposure and estimated human exposure was much lower, although detailed exposure data were lacking. NTP concluded that it had minimal concern for fetal and infant developmental effects due to estimated BBP exposure. Papers published after 2001 confirm the developmental toxicity of BBP.

The NTP monograph on DINP was published in 2003, but like the other monographs that have not been updated, it primarily considers research published before 2001. The scientific evidence for developmental effects from DINP exposure of rodents is adequate \"to conclude that DINP might adversely affect development of the human fetus if the levels of exposure are sufficiently high,\" according to NTP. But the evidence for effects was not as strong as for DEHP and DBP, and in one study that compared the effects of exposure to various phthalates, DINP was found to be less potent than DEHP or DBP by an order of magnitude. In his recent testimony before a House subcommittee, Dr. Leon Earl Gray rated the relative potency for producing developmental harm of various phthalates. He gave DINP a rating of 0.15 relative to DEHP, DBP (both forms), and BBP which he rated 1.0. A number of studies of the potential effects on rodents of DINP exposure were published after 2001, but they appear consistent with the earlier work with respect to developmental toxicity.

One study by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) estimated DINP exposure through measurement of the time children spent in mouthing behavior and an analysis of DINP movement out of various toys. NTP used that data to conclude that its concern was \"minimal\" for developmental effects in children. NTP also had minimal concern for DINP causing adverse effects to human reproduction or fetal development. However, this conclusion was controversial.

The CPSA and the FHSA differ with regard to the rulemaking procedures; the precise nature of the acts prohibited with regard to products or substances that fail to comply with safety standards; and other issues. Therefore, there are advantages and disadvantages to promulgating standards under the CPSA versus the FHSA. One disadvantage of the CPSA rulemaking procedure was eliminated by the CPSIA. The CPSA formerly did not expressly provide injunctive enforcement authority for state attorneys general, unlike the FHSA, which did. CPSIA amends the CPSA to provide state attorneys general authority to enjoin violations of the federal standard.", "Additionally, the recent reform legislation addressed other concerns. Critics alleged problems with the ability of the CPSC to establish safety standards in a timely fashion. For example, some asserted that the rulemaking procedures under the CPSA and other acts under the CPSC's jurisdiction, such as the FHSA, were unnecessarily onerous, requiring protections beyond those required by the Administrative Procedure Act. The CPSIA streamlined the rulemaking procedures of the CPSA by eliminating the required extra step of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking. The CPSIA did not amend the CPSA provisions that encourage the CPSC to rely heavily on voluntary standards where an adequate standard exists with which the industry widely and substantially complies. The voluntary nature of some safety standards limits the action that can be taken by the CPSC for violations. However, the CPSIA legislated mandatory safety standards or rulemaking for certain children's products, including toys, durable infant or toddler products, and standards for lead content and phthalates in certain children's products. The CPSIA revised and expanded the scope of acts prohibited under the CPSA to include manufacture, sale or importation of products that are the subject of a voluntary recall.

Products violating a safety standard may be denied importation.", "Although the European Union and some states have enacted safety standards regarding phthalates in children's products, as discussed below, the CPSC had not promulgated such standards prior to the CPSIA. In 1983, the CPSC determined that DEHP in children's products might result in substantial exposure of children to an animal carcinogen. The CPSC is not permitted to initiate rule-making relating to risks of cancer, birth defects or gene mutations unless it first establishes a Chronic Hazard Advisory Panel to study the issue and make recommendations. The panel appointed to study the risks of DEHP concluded that it could put children at risk of cancer from mouthing of products containing DEHP. Accordingly, the CPSC worked with the children's products industry to reach a voluntary agreement banning the use of DEHP from pacifiers, rattles, and teethers. Although other children's products were not included in the agreement between CPSC and the industry, most manufacturers substituted other phthalates for DEHP in other children's products. DINP was the substitute. Despite studies conducted by the industry in the late 1990s linking DINP to liver toxicity and cancer in rodents, the CPSC concluded that the risk to children from mouthing children's products was minimal. However, the CPSC achieved a voluntary agreement with the industry banning DINP and dioctyl phthalate from pacifiers and bottle nipples. The CPSC appointed a Chronic Hazard Advisory Panel on DINP and conducted other studies in response to a petition to initiate rule-making regarding phthalates in children's products. The panel concluded in 2001 that DINP posed a minimal or nonexistent risk of cancer to humans.

It covers lead and cadmium content and also provides, among other things, for the identification of chemicals of \"high concern\" to children and children's products by the Washington Department of Ecology, for notification to the Department by a manufacturer that its children's product contains a chemical of high concern, and for a product safety education campaign to promote awareness of unsafe children's products. With regard to phthalates, beginning July 1, 2009, it prohibits a manufacturer, wholesaler, or retailer from manufacturing, knowingly selling, offering for sale, or distributing for sale or for use in the state a children's product or product component containing phthalates, individually or in combination, at a concentration exceeding 0.1% by weight (a thousand parts per million). It defines phthalates as meaning the six phthalates discussed in this report. It adopts the California definition of \"toy,\" but does not refer to \"child-care articles.\" Instead, it defines \"children's product,\" which includes the California definition of a child-care article, expanding it to include children's clothing, and also includes toys, children's cosmetics (for children under the age of 12), children's jewelry (for children under the age of 12), and car seats (it also includes a list of items not considered \"children's products\")."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Legislative Activity", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008", "paragraphs": ["On July 28, 2008, the House and Senate conferees for H.R. 4040 , the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, announced that an agreement on a final text had been reached resolving the differences between the Senate and House versions of the bill. The bill was approved in both chambers before the August recess and signed into law by the President on August 14, 2008 ( P.L. 110 - 314 ).", "Beginning 180 days after enactment, the CPSIA \u00a7108 permanently bans the three phthalates whose toxicity is not disputed and temporarily bans three other phthalates pending a review by a Chronic Hazard Advisory Panel (CHAP). It prohibits children's toys or child care articles that contain more than 0.1 percent DEHP, DBP, or BBP. The sale of children's toys that can be placed in the mouth or child care articles containing concentrations of more than 0.1 percent of DINP, DIDP, or DnOP, is prohibited on an interim basis until a review by a CHAP. After the CPSC receives the report from the CHAP, it would determine, by rule, whether to continue the interim ban. The provision does not restrict phthalate alternatives. It defines \"children's toy\" as \"a consumer product designed or intended by the manufacturer for \"a child 12 years of age or younger, for use by the child when the child plays.\" \"Child care article\" is defined as \"a consumer product designed or intended by the manufacturer to facilitate sleep or the feeding of children age 3 and younger or to help such children with sucking or teething.\" The statute includes guidelines for determining whether a product was intended or designed for use by children of the specified ages and whether a toy can be placed in a child's mouth.", "As discussed above, this provision also clarified any preemptive effect these standards would have on state laws. Non-identical provisions would be preempted, unless a state applied for and the CPSC granted an exemption for stronger protections under state laws, and the federal law would not preempt restrictions on phthalate alternatives. The CPSIA standard differs somewhat from each of the existing state laws described above. For example, the federal law differs from the state laws with regard to the definition of toys, children's products, or children's articles, and the age group for which these consumer products are intended. It appears that the new federal phthalates safety standard preempts the recent state laws that were enacted in the absence of federal standards, to the extent that they do not provide identical protection for the same risk of injury.", "The final phthalates provision resolved differences between the Senate and House treatment of a phthalates ban and between proponents and opponents of a permanent ban on all six phthalates named in the legislation, including restrictions on certain alternatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Senate Version of H.R. 4040", "paragraphs": ["The final phthalates provision evolved from a Senate-approved amendment to H.R. 4040 .

It adopted the California statutory definition of \"child care article\" and did not adopt its definition of \"toy,\" but instead defined \"children's product\" as \"a toy or any other product designed or intended by the manufacturer for use by a child when the child plays,\" which effectively included the same products as the California statute.", "The provision would have treated as a banned hazardous substance under the FHSA any children's product or child-care article which (1) contains in any part any combination of DEHP, DBP or BBP in concentrations exceeding 0.1% or (2) is intended for use by a child that can be placed in a child's mouth and either contains any combination of DINP, DIDP or DnOP in concentrations exceeding 0.1% or contains any combination of any of the six phthalates in concentrations exceeding 0.1%.

However, unlike the California statute, the provision would not have required manufacturers to use the least toxic alternative as a substitute for phthalates.", "Section 40 would have provided that neither it nor FHSA \u00a718(b)(1)(B) (15 U.S.C. \u00a71261 note), concerning preemption of non-identical State or local regulations of banned hazardous substances, would preempt State or local laws applying to a phthalate other than the six described in the bill; applying to a phthalate described in the bill that is not otherwise regulated by the bill; requiring a warning of risk, illness, or injury regarding any phthalate; or prohibiting the use of alternatives to phthalates not prohibited under this bill.

The strongest evidence with respect to developmental effects has been produced since about the year 2000. Many of these studies were not available to the NTP or to CPSC when they reviewed the phthalate literature in 2000 or 2001. At that time, regulators focused on carcinogenic effects, rather than effects on fetal development. This more recent animal evidence strongly supports a claim that DEHP, DBP, and DBB can harm reproduction and damage fetal and juvenile development in rats.", "The structure-activity relationship (between the molecular structure of the phthalates and developmental damage) is well understood, such that scientific concern focuses now on DEHP, DBP, and DBB. DINP also is a developmental toxicant, but is only about 15% as potent as the most potent phthalates. To the extent that it is still studied, it is generally studied together with other more potent toxic phthalates to evaluate additivity of effects. Scientific evidence regarding the other phthalates mentioned in the new law is lacking. Limited evidence indicates that DIDP, DINP, and DnOP might have effects on the immune system, but these phthalates appear to be much less toxic to developing rodents.", "Data indicate that people are exposed to many phthalates, especially DEHP, DBP (di-n-butyl), and DBB. Children appear to be most heavily exposed. Data are insufficient to judge exposure for DINP, DIDP, and DnOP. Individuals such as newborn babies in the intensive care units of hospitals face multiple and continuous phthalate exposures.", "Scientists are just beginning to explore the additive effects of exposure to multiple phthalates, as well as to phthalates in combination with certain pesticides.", "To date, studies suggest there may be additive effects of multiple phthalate exposures. The National Academy of Sciences is evaluating the risk of aggregate human exposure to multiple phthalates, and is expected to report before the end of 2008."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reducing Risks Without Generating Greater Risks", "paragraphs": ["By restricting the use of six phthalates in child-care items and toys, the new law codifies the voluntary agreements reached by CPSC with product manufacturers (to keep DEHP and DINP out of nipples, pacifiers, and teething toys, and DEHP out of toys that might be mouthed) and should reduce exposure to DINP, the only phthalate currently used in the United States to produce toys. The effect of banning use of the other phthalates is less clear, because their child-related uses are not known. However, because the law prohibits their use as substitutes for DINP in toys, toys should be eliminated as a source of exposure.", "For each use, different chemicals might be used in lieu of the six phthalates. Acetates might be used in some applications; phthalates other than the six specified might be used in others. The risks of such chemicals may be known or unknown. Given the lack of legal authority to require testing for a chemical proposed for most uses, and the cost of testing, new formulations of products might pose either more or less risk than the current formulations."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
