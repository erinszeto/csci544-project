{"id": "R42443", "title": "Israel: Possible Military Strike Against Iran\u2019s Nuclear Facilities", "released_date": "2012-09-28T00:00:00", "summary": ["Several published reports indicate that top Israeli decisionmakers are seriously considering whether to order a military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, and if so, when. Twice in Israel's history, it has conducted air strikes aimed at halting or delaying what Israeli policymakers believed to be efforts to acquire nuclear weapons by a Middle Eastern state\u2014destroying Iraq's Osirak reactor in 1981 and a facility the Israelis identified as a reactor under construction in Syria in 2007. Today, Israeli officials generally view the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran as an unacceptable threat to Israeli security\u2014with some describing it as an existential threat. This report analyzes key factors that may influence Israeli political decisions relating to a possible strike on Iranian nuclear facilities. These include, but are not limited to, the views of and relationships among Israeli leaders; the views of the Israeli public; U.S., regional, and international stances and responses as perceived and anticipated by Israel; Israeli estimates of the potential effectiveness and risks of a possible strike; and responses Israeli leaders anticipate from Iran and Iranian-allied actors\u2014including Hezbollah and Hamas\u2014regionally and internationally.", "For Congress, the potential impact\u2014short- and long-term\u2014of an Israeli decision regarding Iran and its implementation is a critical issue of concern. By all accounts, such an attack could have considerable regional and global security, political, and economic repercussions, not least for the United States, Israel, and their bilateral relationship. It is unclear what the ultimate effect of a strike would be on the likelihood of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. The current Israeli government, President Barack Obama, and many Members of Congress have similar concerns about Iran's nuclear program. They appear to have a range of views on how best to address those shared concerns. Iran maintains that its nuclear program is solely for peaceful, civilian energy and research purposes, and U.S. intelligence assessments say that Iran has not made a decision to build nuclear weapons. However, Iran continues to enrich uranium in militarily hardened sites and questions remain about its nuclear weapons capabilities and intentions.", "Short- and long-term questions for Members of Congress to consider regarding a possible Israeli decision to strike Iranian nuclear facilities militarily might include, but are not limited to, the following:", "How might an Israeli strike affect options and debate regarding short-term and long-term U.S. relations and security cooperation with, and foreign assistance to, Israel and other regional countries? Would an Israeli strike be considered self-defense? Why or why not? What would be the legal and policy implications either way? How might a strike affect the implementation of existing sanctions legislation on Iran or options and debate over new legislation on the subject? How might Congress consult with the Obama Administration on and provide oversight with respect to various political and military options?", "This report has many aspects that are the subject of vigorous debate and remain fully or partially outside public knowledge. CRS does not claim to independently confirm any sources cited within this report that attribute specific positions or views to various Israeli, U.S., or other officials.", "This is an update of a report dated March 28, 2012.

After seemingly unsuccessful attempts by Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu to persuade President Barack Obama to present Iran with a time-specific ultimatum (see \" U.S. Concerns and Possible Responses: Possible Impact on Israeli Decisionmaking \" below), prospects for future Israeli military action remain unclear. The complex array of information and views set forth in this section may help U.S. policymakers address relevant questions on this issue within the context of various regional and global economic, political, and security concerns.

The rationale for a possible strike is set forth in detail below (see \" Possible \"Zone of Immunity\" and Israel's Ability to Act Independently \"). This has enlivened an already vigorous public debate in Israel (as discussed below). A wide array of current and former leaders in Israel's political, military, and security establishments have either publicly expressed opposition or are reportedly opposed, not to an attack in principle, but to an attack without U.S. support given possible operational and political fallout. Seemingly heated private and public exchanges between the Obama Administration and Netanyahu government (discussed below) have occurred within the context of frequent consultations\u2014including summer 2012 visits to Israel by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, and National Security Advisor Tom Donilon. ", "In a September 27 speech before the United Nations General Assembly in which he stressed that the hour was getting \"very late,\" Netanyahu said, \"I believe that faced with a clear red line, Iran will back down. This will give more time for sanctions and diplomacy to convince Iran to dismantle its nuclear weapons program altogether.\" He asserted that otherwise, at current rates of uranium enrichment, Iran could reach the final stage of enrichment by the spring or summer of 2013. Netanyahu's remarks appear to have convinced several former Israeli officials and other international commentators that the timeline for a possible Israeli attack has been pushed back at least to early 2013. However, one Israeli journalist reportedly wrote, \"If one takes his statements seriously, within a short time, months at most, if Iran is not deterred and if the US does not attack, Israel will launch an attack on its own.\"", "Speculation persists regarding a possible Israeli strike, even though\u2014as discussed below (see \" Effect on Iran's Nuclear Program \")\u2014most Israeli officials and analysts agree that military action might only delay, not destroy, Iran's nuclear program. Other efforts\u2014diplomacy, sanctions, reported covert action, even implied threats of military action by Israel or the United States\u2014have not led Iran's regime either to stop expanding its uranium enrichment activities or to take steps toward assuring the international community that its nuclear program is confined to purely peaceful purposes. Israel is not a direct party to the P5+1 (see \" Military Action Versus Alternative Courses of Action \" below for a definition of this term) negotiations over Iran's nuclear program, where technical discussions that continued in the spring and summer of 2012 made no apparent progress. ", "In August 2012, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon called upon the international community to acknowledge that diplomacy had failed. In August 2012, Congress and the President enacted the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 ( P.L. 112-158 ), an additional sanctions law aimed at Iran's oil exports. Most analysts agree that these sanctions, combined with preexisting U.S. and international sanctions (see \" Military Action Versus Alternative Courses of Action \" below), are significantly affecting Iran's economy, and reports indicate that Israeli officials may seek additional sanctions. The August 2012 International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report on Iran's nuclear program reiterated concern over continued enrichment and evidence of possible military dimensions to the program. For more information on U.S. and international sanctions, diplomatic efforts, and their collective impact, as well as the August IAEA report, see CRS Report RL32048, Iran: U.S. Concerns and Policy Responses , by [author name scrubbed]; CRS Report RS20871, Iran Sanctions , by [author name scrubbed]; and CRS Report R40094, Iran's Nuclear Program: Tehran's Compliance with International Obligations , by [author name scrubbed].", "Israeli concerns regarding a potential Iranian nuclear weapons capability may be exacerbated by reports that Iran has deliberately provided faulty information about its nuclear program to international monitors. This may further heighten Israeli and international concerns about the reliability and comprehensiveness of current information regarding the program and its progress. ", "Media attention to deliberations among Netanyahu and the other members of the 14-member Israeli security cabinet (see \" Decisionmakers: Views and Interactions \" below) has intensified. A vote of approval from the security cabinet is necessary before ordering military action. A late August New York Times report indicated that of those within the security cabinet whose views are thought to be known, approximately six members are in favor of a strike, with three or four opposed. ", "The implications for Israeli decisionmaking of press articles pointing to Israeli emphasis on home front safety and streamlined cabinet procedures reportedly giving Netanyahu greater control over the decisionmaking process are unclear. In August 2012, Netanyahu appointed Avi Dichter, a former head of the Israel Security Agency (also known as the Shin Bet), as Home Front Defense Minister after his predecessor was named ambassador to China. Reports indicate that Dichter\u2014though not a member of the security cabinet\u2014has joined the group of eight other ministers (previously known as the \"octet,\" now known as the \"group of nine\") that has particularly significant influence over the national security decisionmaking process. Netanyahu disbanded security cabinet meetings earlier than planned during the first week of September, reportedly due to leaks of disagreements over when Iran would reach a \"zone of immunity\" (the term is described below\u2014see \" Possible \"Zone of Immunity\" and Israel's Ability to Act Independently \"). If, when, and how Netanyahu might call a vote in the security cabinet and/or the full 29-member cabinet remains unclear.", "Another possible consideration for Netanyahu is that he will face national elections sometime in 2013; he has faced a drop in approval ratings in 2012\u2014from over 50% in March to 31% in August. This drop may not fundamentally undermine Netanyahu's chances for another prime ministerial term in Israel's coalition-based parliamentary system. However, changing electoral prospects might affect his and other actors' decisionmaking on Iran. Polls continue to indicate that a majority of Israelis opposes a unilateral Israeli strike against Iranian nuclear facilities at this time, but that a slight majority would support a joint U.S.-Israel strike. Ehud Olmert, Israel's previous prime minister, who reportedly ordered Israel's 2007 strike on a presumed Syrian nuclear reactor, and whose political comeback prospects have been the subject of Israeli domestic speculation, was quoted as saying in September:", "Worse comes to worst, and all options have been tried, then, naturally it may force Israel to act to defend its existence. But it must be clear that we tried with the international community, and particularly with the United States, to act together before we resort to the last option of an Israeli military operation.", "Public debate in Israel continues to reflect disagreement over both the likelihood and the advisability of an attack. At least one analyst has asserted that Israeli leaders appear to be preparing the \"Israeli home front, and international public opinion, for the inevitably messy aftermath of any such action.\" Other commentators\u2014who note that Israeli leaders did not provide prior warning before military attacks in 1981 and 2007, respectively, against presumed Iraqi and Syrian nuclear reactors\u2014have said that \"all the loose talk of a brewing strike is a signal the warnings are little more than posturing.\" One journalist argued that Israel might strike Iran \"just to prove that they're serious\" to a largely skeptical world. Another journalist wrote that the key question \"is whether Netanyahu sees the threat of Iran building a nuclear bomb as so severe that he is willing to risk severe friction with the United States, a severe blow to the Israeli economy, the possibility of a bloody regional war, and a hail of missiles from Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas, and perhaps Syria hitting Israel.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Possible Operational and Cost-Benefit Considerations for Israel", "paragraphs": ["Israeli censorship rules reportedly limit public discussion of operational details of a possible Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities. Nevertheless, sources that discuss potential military capabilities, options, and outcomes, such as a 2012 book by an Israeli military correspondent and an Israeli military historian, could shed some light on Israeli decisionmakers' calculations. U.S. and international sources have provided some additional information on this subject since late March 2012. A September report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) concluded that although an Israeli strike was possible, \"it would be complex and high risk in the operational level and would lack any assurances of a high mission success rate.\" Furthermore, the report stated that Iranian retaliation will have \"devastating regional consequences.\" Some other commentators have presented what they claim to be leaked information from U.S. or Israeli sources pertaining to possible operational details of potential Israeli military action. ", "In response to a question in an August Ha'aretz interview about whether the potential domestic, regional, and international costs of Israeli military action would be worth \"a two-year delay in Iran's inevitable nuclearization,\" an Israeli \"decisionmaker\" widely assumed to be Defense Minister Barak said:", "Our objective is not to wipe out the Iranian nuclear program. But it must be understood that the real story is the contest between Iran's nuclearization and the fall of the current regime of the ayatollahs in Iran. If we succeed in pushing off the nuclear program by six or eight or 10 years, there's a good chance that the regime will not survive until the critical moment. So the objective is delay.", "Meir Dagan, who ended his eight-year tenure as head of Israel's Mossad in early 2011, is one of the most outspoken opponents of an Israeli strike against Iranian nuclear facilities in the near future. When interviewed for a September New Yorker article, Dagan said:", "An Israeli bombing would lead to a regional war and solve the internal problems of the Islamic Republic of Iran. It would galvanize Iranian society behind the leadership and create unity around the nuclear issue. And it would justify Iran in rebuilding its nuclear project and saying, \"Look, see, we were attacked by the Zionist enemy and we clearly need to have it.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Concerns and Possible Responses: Possible Impact on Israeli Decisionmaking", "paragraphs": ["As mentioned above and discussed further below (see \" The United States \"), U.S. concerns and potential responses regarding the consequences of a possible Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities could significantly affect Israeli decisionmaking. Israeli differences with the Obama Administration over the Iranian nuclear issue have reportedly been the subject of intense private discussions. Additionally, U.S. concerns about regional and international perceptions of U.S. involvement in a potential Israeli attack and the durability of the international sanctions regime against Iran may have at least partly motivated the following August 2012 comments by General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff: \"I don't want to be accused of trying to influence\u2014nor do I want\u2014nor do I want to be complicit if [the Israelis] choose to do it.\" ", "President Obama, in his September 25 address at the annual opening session of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, said that time remains for diplomacy with Iran, but is \"not unlimited.\" He also said that the United States \"will do what we must to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\" Earlier in September, the Administration apparently rejected Israeli requests both for setting firm deadlines for U.S. military action, and for an Obama-Netanyahu meeting later in the month on the sidelines of the annual opening sessions of the U.N. General Assembly. In declining to set deadlines, Secretary of State Clinton set forth her view of U.S.-Israel differences on the issue in a September 2012 interview:", "They're more anxious about a quick response because they feel that they're right in the bull's-eye, so to speak. But we're convinced that we have more time to focus on these sanctions, to do everything we can to bring Iran to a good-faith negotiation.", "Responding at a news conference, Netanyahu was quoted as saying: ", "If Iran knows that there's no deadline, what will it do? Exactly what it's doing: It's continuing without any interference toward obtaining nuclear weapons capability and from there nuclear bombs. The world tells Israel: Wait. There's still time. And I say: Wait for what? Wait until when? Those in the international community who refuse to put red lines before Iran don't have a moral right to place a red light before Israel.", "U.S. responses to Netanyahu's statement, including by Members of Congress, have varied. ", "Regarding levels of U.S.-Israel security cooperation focused on this issue, former Obama White House national security official Dennis Ross suggested in August that \"senior American officials should ask Israeli leaders if there are military capabilities we could provide them with\u2014like additional bunker-busting bombs, tankers for refueling aircraft and targeting information\u2014that would extend the clock for them.\" A U.S. source has reported that the United States has drastically reduced the scope of its planned involvement in a late October joint missile defense exercise with Israel known as Austere Challenge 12 .

Leading Iranian military commanders and advisors, as well as Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah, have indicated that Iran and Hezbollah would retaliate robustly against Israel, and that Iran would possibly also target U.S. positions in the Gulf. Reports indicate that Iran test-fired four surface-to-sea missiles near the Strait of Hormuz in late September, and that it is planning to hold major military preparedness maneuvers in the near future. One senior Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander reportedly said in September that Iran could launch a preemptive strike against Israel if it were sure Israel was preparing to attack it. Reports from September that Iran bears responsibility for recent cyberattacks against various U.S. banks and companies could presage similar attacks in retaliation for a possible Israeli military strike.", "Iranian or Iranian-allied terrorist plots against Israeli targets (see \" Attacks Against Israeli Interests Abroad \" below) also appear to remain a threat.

The act contains non-binding \"sense of Congress\" language focusing largely on possible avenues of cooperation outside of direct bilateral aid, including expediting specific types of arms sales (such as F-35 fighter aircraft, refueling tankers, and bunker buster munitions); providing excess defense articles; boosting operational, intelligence, and political-military coordination; and providing additional aid for Israel's Iron Dome short-range missile defense system and U.S.-Israel cooperative missile defense programs. The act also extended deadlines for Israel to access U.S. war reserves stockpiles and to draw upon existing loan guarantees.

Congress and the President made an initial $205 million appropriation for the program in FY2011. An additional $70 million in U.S. funding was reprogrammed for Iron Dome in FY2012 from prior-year Missile Defense Agency funding for various programs, and will presumably count toward the $680 million figure if H.R. 4310 is enacted. Israel has reportedly spent more than $200 million on initial stages of Iron Dome's development, procurement, and deployment.

For some period of time, Israeli leaders have conveyed their view that Israel may similarly be compelled to act to prevent a potentially nuclear-armed Iran. Analysts generally agree that Israeli military action against multiple Iranian nuclear facilities would be significantly more complex operationally than these previous attacks, both of which targeted single facilities that were closer in range to Israel (see Figure 1 below).

In recent years, however, reports suggest that Israel has pursued covert means\u2014including sabotage, cyberwarfare, and assassination\u2014to intimidate Iran and delay the nuclear program, with some reported success. Without confirming or denying involvement, Israeli officials also generally have welcomed reports of events that might set back Iran's nuclear program.", "Even before the reports in recent months of possible Israeli military action, at various stages of the international effort to persuade Iran to relinquish any possible nuclear weapons ambitions some Israeli officials have hinted that Israel might be compelled to take unilateral action to counter what they see as an Iranian nuclear weapons program.

Some Israeli officials express concerns, based on Iranian leaders' long-standing pronouncements against the existence of Israel, that Iran might seek to use a nuclear weapon against Israel even if faced with the prospect of near-certain retaliation from Israel's presumed but officially undeclared nuclear arsenal. In a 2010 interview, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu was quoted as saying:", "Iran has threatened to annihilate a state. In historical terms, this is an astounding thing. It's a monumental outrage that goes effectively unchallenged in the court of public opinion\u2026. Iranian leaders talk about Israel's destruction or disappearance while simultaneously creating weapons to ensure its disappearance.", "Other leading Israeli officials and analysts\u2014including Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Tamir Pardo, director of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency\u2014generally avoid characterizing the threat from Iran as existential at least partly because they claim that Israel \"is a strong state and it could protect itself under any circumstances.\" According to three Israeli analysts, including a former deputy national security advisor, whether or not Iran will behave as a \"rational actor\" has \"become an important dimension of the Israeli debate about a nuclear Iran.\" ", "Yet, even some Israeli officials who generally avoid characterizing the threat of a nuclear-weapons-capable Iran as existential describe it as still presenting unacceptably high risks. They express concern that a nuclear Iran would compromise traditional Israeli security doctrine and practices\u2014based on principles of self-reliance and maintaining overwhelming military superiority\u2014and lead to an unacceptable level of national security uncertainty. This in turn would fundamentally damage the quality of life and psychological sense of safety that Israelis deem critically important to their country's continued viability as a Jewish national home. According to a March 2012 article in Israel's Jerusalem Report , \"Even if the Iranians don't use the bomb, [Netanyahu] fears the very fact that they have it could lead to a mass exodus of Jews from an Israel under nuclear threat, weakening the state and compromising the Zionist dream.\"", "Some Israelis worry that even if Iran did not attack Israel with a nuclear weapon, mere possession of a weapon or the capability to assemble one quickly would make it more difficult to deter Iran from pursuing greater regional influence and amplifying threats to Israeli security through proxies and allies\u2014the Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah, Hamas and other Palestinian militants in Gaza, and possibly even the beleaguered Asad regime in Syria. Some in Israel, however, argue that Iran might be limited in its ability to use a potential nuclear weapons capability to thwart conventional Israeli military action against regional threats. Analysts discuss a range of other possible regional reactions that would undermine Israeli security, including less willingness of Gulf Arab states to oppose Iranian ambitions; the possibility of proliferation in countries such as Egypt, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia; and perhaps international pressure on Israel either to declare its nuclear weapons status or consider giving it up if Iran would do the same. ", "Israelis continue to debate whether the risks of a nuclear-weapons-capable Iran outweigh the risks of a strike that most assessments doubt would definitively end Iran's nuclear program (see \" Effect on Iran's Nuclear Program \" below). According to one Israeli report, \"Netanyahu faces one of the most difficult choices any Israeli prime minister has had to contemplate. A strike against Iran's nuclear facilities could lead to regional conflagration, tens of thousands of missiles and rockets raining down on Israeli population centers and war on several fronts. But with no attack, Iran could go nuclear on his watch.\" Unlike the wide range of views expressed among U.S. and international analysts about whether a nuclear-weapons-capable Iran might or might not be contained, based on concepts and experiences dating from the Cold War, Israeli officials\u2014according to a 2011 RAND Corporation report\u2014appear to be \"reluctant to address futures involving a nuclear-armed Iran, as they [want] to maintain the focus on preventing such an outcome.\" Some Israeli analysts have, however, contemplated the prospects for mutual deterrence between Israel and Iran, including some who collaborated on the subject in a 2008 memorandum published by Israel's Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), under the assumption that Iran might not be prevented from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability. One article from this memorandum questioned whether Cold War-era containment would be applicable:", "The fact that since Hiroshima and Nagasaki no nuclear device has been used in the course of hostilities might lead to the tentative conclusion that a third use of a nuclear weapon in war is of very low probability. This conclusion is based on the superpowers relationship during the Cold War\u2014the only historical example of a relatively stable and long nuclear deterrence balance. But would this pattern recur in various regional nuclear conflicts?", "Despite Israelis' general reluctance to discuss containment scenarios, some Israeli public figures are less expansive in their characterization of the inherent risks of a potentially nuclear-armed Iran. In the words of one analyst:", "If and when there was a clear Iranian threat to attack Israel, then Israel could launch a preemptive assault.

With regard to our fate, our duty is to rely on ourselves alone.\" ", "In a November 2011 CNN interview, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak appeared to set forth parameters for Israel's ability to act independently when he said that the window of opportunity for a preventive strike to stop or slow Iran's progress toward nuclear weapons capability could close within nine months. He explained that the Iranians could enter a \"zone of immunity\" from military action \"by widening [the] redundancy of their plan, making it spread over many more [sites], with many more elements.\" As evidence of his claim that Iran is progressing toward a zone of immunity, Barak has cited Iran's ongoing movement of enriched uranium and/or uranium enrichment centrifuges into the supposedly difficult-to-attack Fordow facility.", "It is unclear whether Israeli leaders' willingness to make policy decisions in line with the zone of immunity concept explained by Barak might be affected by the views of U.S. military planners who reportedly question the imminence of Iran achieving such a zone. According to a February 2012 New York Times article, a senior Obama Administration official who has discussed the concept with Israelis says that \"'there are many other options' to slow Iran's march to a completed weapon, like shutting off Iran's oil revenues, taking out facilities that supply centrifuge parts or singling out installations where the Iranians would turn the fuel into a weapon.\" ", "The concept Barak has articulated may anticipate that Iran would consider using IAEA-monitored and -safeguarded enrichment facilities at Fordow to produce weapons-grade enriched uranium. Although it is unclear how Iran may act, there is no precedent for an NPT party to use declared facilities to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons. If weapons-grade enrichment were to occur at Fordow or Natanz under IAEA safeguards (assuming that Iran was cooperating with the IAEA), the international community would probably learn of it because of the difficulty in diverting significant amounts of nuclear material from safeguarded centrifuge facilities without detection. ", "To put the current Israeli debate into context, one report has claimed that Barak's \"zone of immunity\" warning did not mark \"the first time that the Israelis have invented a phrase that suggests a hard deadline before an attack. At the end of the Bush administration, they said they could not allow Iran to go past 'the point of no return.' That phrase was also ill-defined, but seemed to suggest that once Iran had the know-how and the basic materials to make a bomb, it would be inevitable.\" In that case, and in the current case as well, some observers have expressed opinions that the timetables are mainly intended to intimidate Iran and to prod the United States and other international actors into taking tougher and more urgent action.

Many Israeli officials acknowledge that sanctions have begun to significantly affect Iran's economy. That effect could be compounded following the March 2012 expulsion by the Brussels-based SWIFT (Society for Worldwide International Financial Transfers) of all Iranian banks blacklisted by the EU from its electronic transfer system. It is not clear, however, how a sustained, intensifying economic impact on the Iranian regime and its people could affect the regime's behavior or policy, including with regard to a possible return to international diplomacy. In early March, the \"P5+1\" (United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, China, and Russia) accepted Iran's proposal to restart negotiations in the spring of 2012 on its nuclear program. Israeli Vice Prime Minister and Strategic Affairs Minister Moshe Ya'alon was quoted as saying in March that the spring 2012 talks between Iran and the P5+1 would show \"if there is a chance that the sanctions are working or that the Iranians are continuing to manoeuvre and advance toward a military nuclear capability.\"", "It is also unclear to what extent Israelis believe that their alleged ongoing covert action or \"secret war\" against Iran's nuclear program might mitigate the need for an air strike. The two most recently retired heads of the Mossad, Meir Dagan and Ephraim Halevy, have both publicly stated that an Israeli military strike against Iran's nuclear facilities would be counterproductive, partly because they both reportedly \"believe sabotage and diplomacy have done much to set back Iran's nuclear ambitions and can do more yet.\" Dagan has been quoted as saying, \"The Iranian problem must be shaped as an international problem, and efforts to delay Iran's nuclear program should continue.\" In March 2012, Vice Prime Minister Ya'alon was quoted as saying, when asked if Israel might be just weeks away from a strike on Iran, \"No. Look, we have to see.

Should Israel fail to openly debate and account for these factors in advance of an attack, it may end up with a strategic debacle, even if it achieves its narrow military goals.", "Israeli sources indicate that top leaders are divided on the issue. One journalist asserted in February that Netanyahu's and Barak's apparent support for an attack in the near future is countered by many cabinet ministers and security establishment officials who supposedly share former Mossad chief Dagan's perspective \"against a strike and in favor of sanctions and covert operations.\" That view is based at least partly on doubts about Israel's military capability to set back Iran's nuclear program three to five years. According to a November 2011 article by another Israeli journalist:", "Benny Begin and Moshe Yaalon, two of the most hardline right-wing ministers in the \"Octet Forum,\" the Israeli Cabinet's main decision-making body, are currently opposed to an attack because they believe a military strike will cause a massive backlash from Iran and its proxies and should only be a very last resort.", "According to the same article, \"Netanyahu's decision to replace Dagan [in early 2011]\u2014coupled with Barak's insistence on removing popular army chief [Gabi] Ashkenazi in February [2011]\u2014was seen by many as an intentional strategy to remove opponents of a military strike on Iran from positions of influence.\" In June 2011, the New York Times quoted Dagan as saying, \"I decided to speak out because when I was in office, [former Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) director Yuval] Diskin, Ashkenazi and I could block any dangerous adventure.

With the exception of ministers Benny Begin and Dan Meridor, a tenacious objection against an Israeli strike on Iran is not expected.\"", "Some Israeli analysts question whether Netanyahu is likely to launch a strike against Iran. He has not ordered a major military offensive during either of his stints as Israel's prime minister (1996-1999 and 2009-present), possibly owing in part to what some analysts have observed to be a generally cautious approach to decisionmaking.

We've waited for sanctions to work. None of us can afford to wait much longer. As Prime Minister of Israel, I will never let my people live under the shadow of annihilation.

They say that a military confrontation with Iran would undermine the efforts already underway, that it would be ineffective, and that it would provoke even more vindictive action by Iran.

In 2007, according to former President George W. Bush, Netanyahu's predecessor Ehud Olmert unsuccessfully sought U.S. action to destroy the secret Syrian reactor before he ordered the Israeli strike. President Bush said that he declined to order military action owing to the low confidence of the U.S. intelligence community that Syria had a nuclear weapons program, proposing\u2014to Olmert's dismay\u2014that they instead publicly expose the reactor's existence and pursue internationally backed coercive diplomacy.", "U.S. views have potential salience for Israeli decisionmakers because top Israeli officials do not necessarily agree with the Obama Administration on every aspect of how to address Iran's nuclear program.

Syria might not see ingressing aircraft, but the ability to blind the Syrians again, after doing so in 2007, is not something Israel can take for granted.\"", "Although there have been past reports\u2014officially denied\u2014that Saudi Arabia has granted or would grant advance permission for Israel to overfly its territory, Israel may rely on technological and logistical advantages mentioned in the above paragraph to elude interception during its overflight of third-party countries. Additionally, according to a book by two U.S. analysts, \"For all these countries except Syria, the balance of incentives might well lie on the side of silence \u2026 a humbled Iran would be the overriding interest, especially if intercepting aircraft were likely to be shot to pieces by Israeli fighters.\" Active resistance to Israeli overflight using surface-to-air missiles or intercepting aircraft could, at a minimum, derail Israel's \"intricate attack plan\" \u2014for example, by lengthening Israeli flight routes and complicating refueling plans. ", "A second challenge is that the distance to targets and the size of a possible strike package would require all of Israel's aerial refueling capability, with little or no margin for equipment or operational failures. A February 2012 Economist article anticipated the facilities that an Israeli strike might target:", "Israel would probably pay particular attention to the enrichment plants at Natanz and Fordow; after them would come the facility at Isfahan that turns uranium into a gas that the centrifuges can work with and the heavy-water reactor under construction at Arak, both of which are above the ground. The larger Russian-built reactor at Bushehr would probably escape unscathed; it is less relevant to weapons work and damage to it could spread contamination across the Gulf.", "See Figure 1 for a map of major Iranian facilities in regional context. Israel has five KC-130s and four 707-based tankers similar to American KC-135s. A 2009 study estimated a need for 12 tanker equivalents per mission simply to attack Iranian nuclear facilities at Esfahan, Natanz, and Arak (the Fordow facility had not yet been revealed). Without additional tankers, the fighters would have to refuel twice over the duration of the mission. This need may be somewhat reduced by the fact that Israel is also believed to have \"mastered the operation of 'buddy refueling,'\" using the F-15s' drop tanks to refuel the shorter-range F-16s en route. Additionally, one Israeli report states, \"For the last few years, Israeli representatives have been snapping up every old Boeing 707 airliner in good condition \u2026 and converting them into airborne tankers. According to various sources, the IAF has by now eight or nine such tankers.\"", "Analysts differ in assessing the effectiveness of Iranian air defenses. Iran's defensive missile systems are among the least modern in the Middle East, relying on Hawk systems supplied by the United States before the Iranian Revolution and Vietnam-era Russian SA-2s, along with a few more modern SA-5s. But they are controlled, some argue, by a modern, coordinated network. One analyst has said, \"They're not using wax pencils on glass\u2026. [t]hey have updated computerized modern air defenses.\" Another has raised the possibility, however slight, that Russia might have \"in recent years secretly supplied [Iran] with the SA-12 Giant or the latest variants of the S-300 series\" air defense systems. If that is the case, analysts estimate that the attrition rate of Israeli aircraft in an air strike could be significantly higher than otherwise."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Aircraft", "paragraphs": ["Although an attack on Esfahan, Natanz, and Arak might require deploying only 20% of Israel's top-line fighters purchased from the United States, it would probably require 100% of the most capable\u2014the IAF's 25 F-15Is. Undertaking additional strikes on Fordow and possibly other facilities\u2014such as those related to research, centrifuge production, uranium mining and processing, or even possible weapons production\u2014would probably require diverting some of these aircraft from the first three targets and possibly addressing some targets through alternative means (see below). According to a Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) report, \"Israeli aircraft would probably need to carry close to their maximum payloads to achieve the necessary level of damage against most targets suspected of WMD activity, although any given [above-ground] structure could be destroyed with 1-3 weapons.\" Striking Natanz, Esfahan, and Arak simultaneously would probably require 90 tactical fighters, including a 10% margin for reliability.

The Guided Bomb Unit (GBU)-27 2000-lb class weapon carries 550 lbs of high explosives, and can penetrate more than six feet of reinforced concrete. The GBU-28 5000-lb class weapon penetrates at least 20 feet of concrete and 100 feet of earth. According to CSIS, \"The key weapon to be used against hard targets and underground sites like Natanz might be the GBU-28, although the US may have quietly given Israel much more sophisticated systems or Israel may have developed its own.\" Because the GBU-27 and -28 can be laser-guided, other aircraft or special operations forces inserted on the ground may be used to designate the target.", "Israel possesses Jericho II medium-range ballistic missiles with ranges capable of striking Iran. They could be used against above-ground targets and free up aircraft to focus on hardened targets or those less amenable to missile attack. However, whether these ballistic missiles have the accuracy and capacity to destroy such targets in Iran is unclear.", "From a weaponeering perspective, Fordow offers a unique challenge. Because the facility is reportedly built inside a mountain an estimated 295 feet deep, Israel's current earth-penetrating munitions may be ineffective. Observers suggest strikes against the reinforced entrance doors may be necessary, which would require a great degree of precision. Such an attack would not be possible with missiles, as the angle of approach required would not be possible from a ballistic trajectory. According to CSIS, \"The hard target bombs [Israel] has acquired from the US are bunker-busters, however, not systems designed to kill underground facilities. They could damage entrances but not the facilities. What is not known is whether Israel has its own ordnance or has secretly acquired more sophisticated systems.\" ", "However, it may not be necessary to damage a facility directly in order to disrupt its functionality. Centrifuges, for example, require an enormous degree of precision to work, and even a relatively minor shock or other event can destroy a centrifuge's utility. In the case of Natanz, even if the reinforced building is not breached, an explosion strong enough to significantly damage the walls could still ruin centrifuges\u2014and the consensus of planners is that one to two GBU-28s would be sufficient to shatter the reinforced dome. At Fordow, assuming that munitions would not be able to penetrate the mountainous terrain over the facility, the question would be how well the centrifuges have been isolated from shock and the possible blast effects of an attack on the facility's entrances. In a Washington Post interview apparently contemplating a hypothetical U.S. strike on Fordow, a U.S. defense analyst was cited as a source for the following statement: \"'There are good outcomes short of destroying' the centrifuge hall. Strikes against more accessible targets\u2014from tunnel entrances and air shafts to power and water systems\u2014can effectively knock the plant out of action.\" ", "See Figure 3 below for a graphic with reported details on the underground facilities at Natanz and Fordow and on penetrating munitions that could be used to target the facilities.", "In a February 2012 Bipartisan Policy Center report, former Senator Charles S.

Although its warhead would cause little to no more damage than a GBU-28's, the report asserts that \"The GBU-31 would augment the IAF's existing capabilities, in this case by increasing the likelihood that any given sortie would score a direct hit on its target.\" Reports indicate that Prime Minister Netanyahu might have requested additional GBU-28s and tanker aircraft from U.S. officials during his early March 2012 Washington, DC, trip, though White House Press Secretary Jay Carney claimed that the topic was not discussed in Netanyahu's meeting with the President."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Potential Factors in an Israeli Decision: Estimated Effects of a Possible Strike", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Effect on Iran's Nuclear Program204", "paragraphs": ["Another major consideration for Israeli decisionmakers is the ultimate impact of an Israeli military strike on Iran's existing nuclear program. Israeli officials and analysts generally agree that a strike would not completely destroy the program. One journalist has said, \"According to the Israeli assessment, a successful strike, a strike that would be conducted according to planning, would \u2026 inflict a significant damage that would end with a delay of three to five years.\" In February 2012, a senior Israeli official was cited in Time magazine as saying that \"given the wide geographic dispersion of Iran's atomic facilities, combined with the limits of Israel's air armada, the Jewish state can expect to push back the Iranian program by only a matter of months\u2014a year at most, according to the official. He attributes that estimate to the Israel Atomic Energy Commission, which is charged with assessing the likely effect of a strike.\" In March 2012, however, another source cited optimism among some Israeli national security officials that a strike in \"the next six months\u2014conducted before Iran can further harden its nuclear sites, or make them redundant\u2014will set back the ayatollahs' atomic ambitions at least five years.\" Aside from estimates of how much time the Iranian program might be set back as a result of a strike, Israeli officials and analysts have generally not focused in open sources on technical details that might provide hints about potential Israeli attack plans and how they might factor into Israeli decisionmaking. According to one Israeli analysis from January 2012:", "the censor's office is charged with preventing publication of secrets that may harm state security\u2026. A public discussion ought not to deal with the operational issues connected to a military action, lest operational plans, Iranian vulnerabilities, and limitations of Israeli capabilities are exposed. In addition, the public does not have the necessary information for a discussion of this sort, such as detailed intelligence on the Iranian nuclear program and information on the IDF's operational capabilities that are relevant to such an action.", "Public discussion of this issue in the United States may give some hint as to the considerations Israeli leaders are addressing. Many officials and analysts in the United States have argued that, following a military attack that destroyed most of Iran's major nuclear facilities, Iran would be able to reconstitute the program. General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in his February 19 CNN interview, said:", "I think that Israel has the capability to strike Iran and to delay the production or the capability of Iran to achieve a nuclear weapons status, probably for a couple of years. But some of the targets are probably beyond their reach and, of course, that's what\u2014that's what concerns them. That's this notion of a zone of immunity that they discuss. ", "According to a February 13, 2012, CRS telephone interview with a U.S. executive branch official, an attack that left Iran's conversion and centrifuge production facilities intact would considerably reduce the timeline for reconstitution. This timeline would possibly also be affected by variables such as the number of centrifuges and quantity of LEU and 20%-enriched uranium remaining usable after an attack. Director of National Intelligence Clapper, in February 16, 2012, testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that the intelligence community does not have a \"single number\" for the amount of time necessary for Iran to reconstitute its program, explaining that the number of relevant variables precludes formulating such an assessment. Reconstitution of a program aimed at developing a full nuclear weapons capability would depend not only on Iran's ability to produce fissile nuclear material for a weapon, but also research, development, and production relating to the creation of both functional warheads and delivery systems such as missiles. ", "Perhaps anticipating that a military strike might not permanently set back Iran's nuclear program, some Israeli officials reportedly acknowledge that Israel may feel compelled to mount periodic follow-up attacks that, in the words of one U.S. analyst, could seek to \"demoralize the industry's workforce, disrupt its operations, and greatly increase the costs of the program. Israeli leaders might hope that their attrition tactics, delivered through occasional air strikes, would bog down the nuclear program while international sanctions weaken the civilian economy and reduce political support for the regime.\" Amos Yadlin, the former head of Israel's military intelligence unit and one of the IAF pilots who carried out the 1981 Osirak strike, wrote in March 2012 that Iran might not fully resume its nuclear program if \"military action is followed by tough sanctions, stricter international inspections and an embargo on the sale of nuclear components to Tehran.\" In contrast, a Israeli analyst wrote in January 2012, \"If Israel attacks Iran now, does that mean Iran would never get nuclear weapons? No, it would merely postpone that outcome for at most a year or two more than it would take otherwise. And then it would ensure an all-out, endless bloody war thereafter.\" Former IAF commander Eitan Ben-Eliyahu, who flew in escort of the 1981 Osirak bombing mission, was cited by the Jerusalem Report in March 2012 as having the view that \"the ultimate success of any military operation in Iran\u2014no matter who carries it out\u2014will depend to a large extent on the follow-up diplomatic activity.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effect on Iran's Regime219", "paragraphs": ["How the Israelis assess the effect of an air strike on the popularity and durability of Iran's regime is unclear, as is whether this is even a major factor in their decisionmaking process. In U.S.-Israel government discussions, U.S. officials reportedly have cited analyses indicating that military action against Iran's nuclear program\u2014particularly if carried out by Israel\u2014might heal increasingly evident rifts within Iranian society and government. U.S. officials assess that divisions are widening among Iranian elites and that Iran's economy is \"weighed down by international sanctions,\" but they are apparently not convinced that these divisions jeopardize the regime. Nevertheless, trends observed over several years\u2014and heightened by a broad uprising in Iran in 2009 over the results of June 12, 2009, presidential elections\u2014suggest that the regime's grip on power might be weakening. U.S. policymakers apparently do not want U.S. allies to undertake any policies that might undermine the perceived deterioration in the regime's position. Secretary of Defense Panetta, at a December 2, 2011, Brookings Institution event, stated that one of the unintended consequences of a military strike on Iran's nuclear program would be that \"the regime that is weak now \u2026 would suddenly be able to reestablish itself, suddenly be able to get support in the region.\" That view is shared by some Iranian opposition figures, including a U.S.-based opposition figure who visited Israel in January 2012 and expressed on Israeli television the view that an Israeli air strike on Iran would increase the regime's domestic popularity.

Therefore, Israeli leaders may not be particularly concerned about incurring the cost of preserving an Iranian regime that might otherwise have collapsed were there no strike. However, according to Israeli analysts who have summarized the Israeli debate over a possible military strike on Iran, regime change \"is regarded by some opponents of a strike as possible, given the degree of discontent prevailing in Iran, especially among its large minorities\u2014and as the only long-term way of rendering Iran's nuclear program less dangerous.\" "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Potential Factors in an Israeli Decision: Possible Iranian Responses to a Strike225", "paragraphs": ["On February 4, 2012, amid widespread reports about Israeli contemplation of a strike, Iranian Supreme Leader Khamene'i was quoted as saying that Iran will \"carry out its own threat in response to the threats of war and oil sanctions should the need arise.\" The potential consequences of a strike on Iran's nuclear program\u2014for Israel, Israel's allies, particularly the United States, and others\u2014are widely assessed to factor significantly into Israel's decisionmaking about a strike.

An Israeli analysis co-authored in January 2012 by former head of military intelligence Amos Yadlin, and not explicitly contemplating Iranian responses to a possible Israeli military strike, expressed skepticism in Iran's abilities to block the Strait for an extended period and further asserted that doing so would run counter to Iran's own economic and strategic interests.

All of these countries have formal defense or facilities access agreements with the United States, and most have had contentious or even hostile relations with Iran since its 1979 Islamic Revolution, although to varying degrees. All have been publicly critical of Iran's nuclear program, and some Saudi royal family members have implied that Saudi Arabia would seek nuclear weapons if Iran obtains them. Analysts see Saudi Arabia, in particular, as a leader in efforts to weaken Iran's influence in the region. Several GCC leaders, including those of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and UAE, have been widely cited in press reports as supporting an air strike on Iran's nuclear program, though in the context of a possible U.S. strike, not an Israeli strike. Nonetheless, Iran might not want to risk a response against the GCC that could cause its members\u2014and with them, other Arab states\u2014to support the Israeli action. ", "All of the GCC states are oil exporters and most have oil loading terminals on the Gulf that are within easy range of Iranian ballistic or cruise missiles. During the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war\u2014particularly the last two years when Iran perceived the United States had entered the war on Iraq's side\u2014Iran attacked some of the Gulf states' facilities, particularly those of Kuwait. Israel does not maintain diplomatic relations with any GCC states. Although Israeli officials have not spoken publicly about the possibility of Iranian retaliation against GCC states, in addition to possible Israeli concerns that such a retaliation might cause the United States to view an Israeli strike negatively because of close U.S. security ties with GCC states, Israel might weigh the possibility that such a retaliation could further antagonize GCC governments and populations toward Israel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Attacks on U.S. Installations and Interests in the Region or Elsewhere Abroad", "paragraphs": ["Another possible concern for Israeli decisionmakers, as mentioned above in multiple quotes from Israeli commentators, is how a potential Iranian response against U.S. interests in the region might affect U.S. official and public views on a strike and U.S.-Israel relations more broadly. Secretary Panetta and others have anticipated that, were Iran to expand its response to U.S. targets, it would target U.S. personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan. The last U.S. combat troops left Iraq in December 2011, but there are still over 16,000 U.S. personnel there (diplomats, other civilian officials, security contractors, and others), including those based at the large U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and at U.S. consulates in Basra and Irbil. U.S. officials have repeatedly asserted that agents of Iran's Qods Force are present in Iraq, building influence with and providing material assistance to Iraqi factions and militias. Like Lebanese Hezbollah, these Iraqi factions have their own independent objectives in Iraqi politics and are not controlled by Tehran, but they are widely assessed to be susceptible to Iranian influence. Pro-Iranian Iraqi Shiite militias are particularly prevalent in southern Iraq, particularly Basra. Analysts perceive that Iran would have ample capability to retaliate there against U.S. personnel following an Israeli air strike. ", "There is also the threat of a potential Iranian response in Afghanistan. Approximately 90,000 U.S. military personnel remain in Afghanistan as of March 2012, but Iran has substantially less influence in Afghanistan than it does in Iraq. Nevertheless, as with Iraq, U.S. officials and U.S. government reports consistently assert that Iran\u2014through the Qods Force\u2014is arming and training anti-U.S. elements in Afghanistan\u2014in this case, anti-government Taliban militants. This suggests that Iran sees potential in retaliating against the United States in Afghanistan.", "The Qods Force is widely believed to operate extensively in some GCC states. On occasion, some GCC countries, particularly Kuwait, have arrested purported Qods Force agents who were allegedly spying or attempting to support Shiite opposition groups in some of these states. U.S. officials accused a Qods-supported Shiite opposition group of a lead role in the June 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers housing complex, in which 19 U.S. Air Force officers were killed. Other U.S. targets in GCC states that Iran might try to attack include the numerous military bases and other facilities that the U.S. military accesses, U.S. embassies, and offices of U.S.-based multinational corporations. The latter are particularly prevalent in the UAE emirate of Dubai. Additionally, according to Bloomberg , Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the air defense division of the IRGC, said in November 2011 that a newly deployed U.S. X-Band radar in eastern Turkey that is part of a NATO-approved missile defense system for Europe would be a target for Iran \"if there is a threat.\" ", "Some believe that Iran, using the Qods Force, could try to retaliate against U.S. targets outside the Middle East\u2014for example in Europe, Asia, Latin America, or elsewhere. U.S. officials have asserted that the Qods Force has a presence in Venezuela, for example, and the force is known to operate worldwide.

An internal Israeli security document that ABC News claimed it obtained in early February 2012 reportedly indicated concern that sites in North America\u2014including both Israeli government sites (embassies and consulates) and Jewish religious and cultural sites (synagogues, schools, community centers) were subject to an increased threat from Iran. Law enforcement officials have reportedly stepped up patrols around Jewish sites in some major U.S. urban areas. Assessments of possible Iranian infiltration of the U.S. homeland are based in part on an alleged plot\u2014contained in a Justice Department indictment filed in October 2011\u2014that an Iranian-American citizen working with officials in the Qods Force sought to kill the Saudi Ambassador in Washington, DC. Citing the alleged plot, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified on January 31, 2012, before the Senate Select Intelligence Committee that: ", "The 2011 plot to assassinate the Saudi Ambassador to the United States shows that some Iranian officials\u2014probably including Supreme Leader Ali Khamene'i\u2014have changed their calculus and are now more willing to conduct an attack in the United States in response to real or perceived U.S. actions that threaten the regime. ", "U.S. officials have incorporated into their assessments Tehran's calculations about the risks of taking such a step. Director Clapper, in his testimony, added that \"Iran's willingness to sponsor future attacks in the United States \u2026 probably will be shaped by Tehran's evaluation of the costs it bears.\" It is unclear how much these considerations factor into Israeli assessments of the possible consequences of a strike."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion: Possible Implications for Congress278", "paragraphs": ["According to one assessment by two U.S. analysts:", "an Israeli decision to risk indeterminate war with the Islamic Republic \u2026 would be momentous, transforming the regional order in ways that cannot be inferred from past wars.", "This report discusses many factors that may influence the Israeli debate and a possible decision by its leaders regarding military action against Iranian nuclear facilities.", "An Israeli strike on Iran could raise significant questions for Members of Congress, both short- and long-term. These include, but are not limited to, the following: ", "How might a strike affect options and debate regarding short-term and long-term U.S. relations and security cooperation with, and foreign assistance to, Israel and other regional countries? Would an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities be considered self-defense? Why or why not? What would be the legal and policy implications either way?
