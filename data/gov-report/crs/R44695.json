DOD exceeded this goal in FY2010, adding 21,826 employees to the workforce ( Figure 1 ). Thus, flexibility use\u2014and overall external civilian acquisition hiring\u2014may have surged through FY2010 to meet the growth initiative goal and declined through FY2013 after reaching it. Sequestration: The across-the-board budget cuts in FY2013, known as sequestration, might explain the slight uptick in flexibility use from FY2013 to FY2014. Flexibility hiring may have dipped in FY2013 due to civilian hiring freezes instituted by DOD in response to sequestration and then increased in FY2014, at which point sequestration was no longer in effect and certain hiring freezes were lifted. Civilian a cquisition workforce losses: The flexibility hiring uptick from FY2013 to FY2014 might also reflect DOD efforts to combat overall workforce losses and preserve growth achieved in previous years. The size of the overall civilian defense acquisition workforce decreased by 1,906 employees between FY2012 and FY2014, from 136,714 to 134,808 employees ( Figure 1 ). Workforce losses outpaced growth in FY2013 and FY2014. Shortfalls in certain acquisition career fields: The flexibility hiring uptick from FY2013 to FY2014 might also reflect DOD efforts to address staffing shortfalls in certain acquisition career fields. While DOD accomplished its overall acquisition workforce growth goal, a 2015 GAO report found that DOD did not meet growth targets for six acquisition career fields.

However, Pathways Internship allows for simplified job announcements that do not have to be posted on USAJOBS.gov and the use of agency-developed, rather than OPM-developed, qualification standards.

In addition, some of these flexibilities have arguably narrow eligibility criteria, which may affect their use for acquisition positions. For example, DHAs for scientific and engineering positions at DOD STRLs include degree requirements and usage caps. The NDAA for FY2016 authorized acquisition-specific DHAs nearly identical to those for STRLs. Budgetary constraints: Flexibility use may be affected by cost-cutting initiatives\u2014such as workforce reductions and hiring freezes\u2014instituted by DOD in response to congressional mandates to reduce the size and cost of its civilian workforce and discretionary spending limits in place through 2021 by the Budget Control Act of 2011. For example, in March 2011, the Secretary of Defense announced the elimination of 33 HQEs as part of a department-wide initiative to reduce overhead costs. Recruitment needs: Use of individual flexibilities may have fluctuated over time to meet DOD's evolving acquisition workforce needs and goals. For instance, as mentioned previously, increased use of the EHA in FY2010 may have occurred to help reach the acquisition workforce growth goal established in FY2009. Establishment of new flexibilities: Some hiring flexibilities may be used less or no longer needed due to the establishment of new flexibilities. For example, DOD officials reported that some flexibilities available under the Civilian Defense Acquisition Personnel Demonstration Project (AcqDemo)\u2014such as modified rating and ranking and scholastic achievement appointment \u2014have been largely superseded by the EHA and Pathways programs. Some Interviewees for a 2011 RAND report also asserted that some of AcqDemo's flexibilities have been superseded by the EHA. Limited knowledge of flexibilities: Given the amount and complex structure of flexibilities, some DOD staff might be unfamiliar with (1) the full range of flexibilities that are available for the defense acquisition workforce, (2) the positions they cover, or (3) how to implement their individual requirements. For example, DOD officials noted that hiring managers have the \"impression\" that using the HQE authority is too difficult and recommended identifying strategies to address this \"misconception.\" Unclear/inconsistent implementation guidance: Unclear or inconsistent implementing guidance on flexibilities\u2014at the department or component-level\u2014may lead to improper or inefficient use. Some DOD acquisition officials reported difficulty using certain flexibilities due to unclear guidance on the application of veterans' preference. For example, some DOD components appear to apply veterans' preference under the EHA, though the flexibility appears to waive it. This may stem from confusion over applicable department-level EHA guidance, which directed components to \"make offers to qualified candidates with veterans' preference whenever practicable \" (italics added). Balancing hiring speed and equity: As recommended by OPM and MSPB, DOD may be balancing the use of hiring flexibilities with traditional competitive hiring to achieve efficient, high-quality hiring.

This, in tandem with the aforementioned time to hire data, might indicate that the EHA's hiring exemptions affected candidates' decisions to accept job offers. In contrast, similar or lower acceptance rates under the EHA might indicate little to no impact of the flexibility on recruiting first choice candidates.
