This total funding level is an increase over the FY2011 level of $55 billion. DOT received approximately the same level of new funding as it received in FY2011, while net budget authority for HUD decreased by about $3.7 billion from FY2011. The FY2012 DOT budget appears to be larger than it was in FY2011 because the FY2011 appropriations act included over $3 billion in rescissions to offset the DOT budget total, which had the effect of making the total look smaller without reducing the amount of funding available to the agency. DOT also received nearly $2 billion in emergency relief appropriations in FY2012, which counterbalanced a $2 billion reduction in highway funding.

The mission of DOT is to serve the United States by ensuring a fast, safe, efficient, accessible, and convenient transportation system that meets vital national interests and enhances the quality of life of the American people today and into the future. DOT is primarily a grant-making and regulatory organization; its programs are organized roughly by mode, providing grants to support the construction of transportation infrastructure for highways, transit, and intercity passenger rail, while providing regulatory oversight to promote safety for the freight rail, commercial trucking, and maritime industries. The exception is aviation; the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) not only administers grants for airport development and regulates the safety of aviation operations, it also operates the air traffic control system of the United States, and it thus accounts for the majority of the employees of DOT.

These include several programs of rental assistance for persons who are poor, elderly, and/or have disabilities. Three rental assistance programs\u2014Public Housing, Section 8 Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance\u2014account for the majority of the department's nonemergency funding (about three-quarters of total funding in FY2010).

Different totals may be published by the committees in their tables and press releases, reported in the press or by advocates, and even presented in this report, all of which may be correct. This is possible because the THUD appropriations bill includes different types of funding mechanisms and savings mechanisms, which can result in different figures being reported for the same programs, depending on how the numbers are being presented. The following section of this report explains the different types of funding often included in the THUD appropriations bill. ", "Most of the programs and activities in the THUD bill are funded through regular annual appropriations , also referred to as discretionary appropriations. This is the amount of new funding allocated each year by the appropriations committees. Appropriations are drawn from the resources of the general fund of the Treasury. For some accounts, the appropriations committees provide advance appropriations , or regular appropriations that are not available until the next fiscal year. ", "In some years, Congress will also provide emergency appropriations , usually in response to disasters. These funds are sometimes provided outside of the regular appropriations acts\u2014often in emergency supplemental spending bills\u2014and are generally provided in addition to regular annual appropriations. Although emergency appropriations typically come from the general fund, they may not be included in the discretionary appropriation total reported for an agency.", "In addition to appropriations, much of the Department of Transportation's budget is derived from contract authority . Contract authority is a form of budget authority based on federal trust fund resources, in contrast to \"regular\" (or discretionary) budget authority, which is based on the resources of the general fund of the Treasury. Contract authority for DOT is generally derived from the Highway Trust Fund and the airport and airways trust fund.", "Congressional appropriators are generally subject to limits on the amount of new non-emergency discretionary funding they can provide in a year. One way to stay within these limits is to appropriate no more than the allocated amount of discretionary funding in the regular annual appropriation act. Another way is to find ways to offset a higher level of discretionary funding. A portion of the cost of providing regular annual appropriations for the THUD bill is generally offset in two ways. The first is through rescissions , or cancellations of unobligated or recaptured balances from previous years' funding. The second is through offsetting receipts and collections , generally derived from fees collected by federal agencies.", "When the Appropriations Committee subcommittees are given their \"302(b) allocations\"\u2014that is, when the total amount that the Appropriations Committee has to spend for a fiscal year is divided among the subcommittees\u2014that figure includes only net discretionary budget authority (non-emergency appropriations, less any offsets and rescissions); contract authority from trust funds is not included. This can lead to confusion, as the annual discretionary budget authority allocations for THUD are typically around half of the total funding provided in the bill, with the remainder made up of contract authority.", "The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), which was enacted into law ( P.L. 112-25 ) on August 2, 2011, following negotiations over raising the ceiling on the national debt, established overall limits, or caps, on the amount of total federal discretionary appropriations that can be provided for each of FY2012 through FY2021. Within these annual spending limits, decisions about the actual amount of appropriations for individual programs or agencies will continue to be made through the regular appropriations process. Under the law, these limits are to be enforced through a sequestration process involving the cancellation of budgetary resources (i.e., spending cuts). This means that if the limits are breached, spending for each non-exempt program will be cut by a uniform percentage.

This included a proposed restructuring of some surface transportation programs and a $50 billion \"up-front\" appropriation, on top of DOT's requested base FY2012 funding, to provide an immediate boost to transportation infrastructure improvement and job creation. This up-front funding was depicted as an alternative to the typical surface transportation reauthorization funding plan, in which funding levels gradually increase over an authorization period of several years.

The initiative is designed to streamline HUD's multiple rental assistance programs in order to permit owners of HUD-assisted properties to better leverage outside resources. Specifically, the $200 million requested would be used to transfer a variety of HUD-assisted housing units with project-based rental assistance from their existing subsidy types to a new form of project-based rental assistance. For FY2012, HUD is proposing that TRA be treated as a demonstration, with a rigorous assessment component, under which up to 236,000 units of public housing and other rent-assisted units owned by private property owners could convert to long-term Section 8 contracts or project-based Section 8 vouchers. According to HUD's budget documents, the demonstration will test conversion under TRA as a tool for preserving public and other assisted housing. Further, this new form of rental assistance will feature tenant mobility, meaning that families living in units receiving this new form of project-based rental assistance would have the option to take their subsidies with them if they choose to move to a new unit of private market\u00a0housing.
