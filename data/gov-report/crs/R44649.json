(As noted earlier, $5 million of the cap adjustment for enforcement was to be transferred to ATTB to pay for new enforcement initiatives in FY2017.) The IRS estimated that the proposed new investments in enforcement programs would have resulted in a return equal to $5.6 of additional revenue for each additional dollar of investment when the needed adjustments in enforcement would be fully implemented in FY2019. Moreover, according to IRS, the new initiatives to strengthen cybersecurity and prevent taxpayer identity theft could yield an estimated return on investment of $12.3 for each additional dollar of spending for those purposes by FY2019.", "The budget request for the IRS included a legislative proposal to extend the IRS's Streamlined Critical Pay (SCP) authority through the end of September 2021. Its authority to make new SCP appointments expired on September 30, 2013. According to Treasury budget documents, the IRS was likely to find it increasingly difficult to recruit and retain talented individuals (especially IT specialists) from the private sector if the SCP authority is not renewed by the end of FY2017.", "Reducing the federal tax gap has been a high priority for the IRS for more than a decade. The gap is defined as the difference between the amount of federal income, excise, estate, and employment taxes owed in a year and the amount of those taxes paid in full and on time. According to the latest estimate by the IRS, the average annual gross gap totaled $458 billion from 2008 to 2010; after allowing for late payments and revenue collected through IRS enforcement activities, the average annual net gap for the period was an estimated $406 billion. The gap has three components: underreporting of income, failure to file, and underpayment of the taxes owed. Underreporting accounted for 85% of the 2008-2010 average annual gross tax gap, underpayment for 9%, and non-filing for 7%. The gross voluntary compliance rate in the period was 81.7%; after allowing for late payments and IRS enforcement actions, the net compliance rate rose to 83.7%.", "The budget request contained 24 legislative proposals, most of which were intended to reduce the tax gap. They can be grouped into three categories: (1) proposals to expand information reporting, (2) proposals to improve business taxpayer compliance, and (3) proposals to bolster tax administration. None could be implemented without congressional approval. According to an estimate by Treasury's Office of Tax Analysis, the proposals would increase revenue by $82.2 billion over 10 years.

In its view, such a filing system would \"change the relationship between taxpayers and their government,\" strain IRS resources, impose new compliance burdens on employers (especially small companies), and create a conflict of interest by forcing the IRS to act simultaneously as a tax collector and enforcer of tax compliance on the one hand, and as a tax preparer on the other hand. As a result, the committee ordered the agency to refrain from working on a pilot project involving a simple tax return without first obtaining the approval of the two appropriations committees, as well as appropriations for that purpose.", "Another issue the committee addressed in its report on H.R. 5485 was the level of service (LOS) the IRS provides to taxpayers. Recent declines in the quality of toll-free telephone service and the quantity of written correspondence have led some to question the IRS's priorities and how it allocates resources among its main responsibilities. The committee agreed with a recommendation by the GAO that the IRS should periodically compare its level of telephone service with the best performers in the private sector to identify gaps between actual and desired performance.

To assess the cost-effectiveness of the voluntary program, the committee directed the IRS, in its report on a bill ( H.R. 2995 ) to fund the IRS in FY2016, to submit a report (after it had been reviewed by the GAO) to both appropriations committees within 120 days of the enactment of the bill.

In its view, the agency \"does not seem to have its priorities in order\" in wanting to move most interactions with taxpayers to the IRS website. The committee also says that the IRS \"continues to ignore the impact of its own behavior on the attitudes of taxpayers\" and remains \"out of touch with taxpayers and their concerns.\" Furthermore, it criticized the agency for what it deemed a willingness to \"cut services to taxpayers in an effort to garner support (in Congress) for increased resources.\" And it claimed that the IRS \"continues to take actions that demonstrate its inability to be transparent about its available resources and flexibility,\" referring to the user fees it collects.", "The committee also drew attention to the contribution of user fees to the IRS operating budget. Under current law, the IRS Commissioner has unlimited control over how the IRS uses the fees. In FY2016, according to the committee, the IRS planned to devote more than half of the user fees it received to acquiring information technology needed to implement the ACA.

One concern was the IRS's latest long-range plan for aligning the agency's capability to provide services with the expectations, needs, and preferences of taxpayers; the plan is known as Future State. A primary objective of the plan is to encourage more and more taxpayers to use online tools and support to get needed assistance. Some interested parties, including the National Taxpayer Advocate (NTA), have urged the IRS to get additional input from taxpayers and tax practitioners before moving ahead with the plan. In the committee's view, too few taxpayers might have the ability to access online information (like their own tax accounts) to make Future State a feasible alternative anytime soon to visits to Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TACs) and calls to IRS's toll-free phone lines. As a result, it directed the IRS to submit a report to the two appropriations committees, the Senate Finance Committee, and the House Ways and Means Committee no later than one year after online accounts are available for use by taxpayers. The report should be done in consultation with the NTA and should focus on current usage of and future plans for online accounts, including the number and percentage of taxpayers who tried to open an account and failed.", "The committee also expressed concern about recent closures of TACs and the increasing number of centers staffed by one person. Citing IRS estimates, it noted that the total number of taxpayers getting assistance at TACs was expected to drop by 16% from FY2015 to FY2016. Of particular concern to the committee was the impact of Future State on rural taxpayers. In its view, TAC closures tied to the initiative would increase the dependence of many of these taxpayers on paid preparers or leave them unable to obtain timely and reliable assistance with pre-filing or post-filling questions. To address this concern, the committee directed the IRS to hold a public hearing in any community where it plans to close a TAC and to notify both appropriations committees of its intention. In addition, the IRS is required to submit a report to the committees on its \"strategic plan\" for improving services for rural, elderly, disabled, minority, and low-income taxpayers, closing TACs, and providing alternative services under the Future State initiative.", "Another issue addressed by the committee in its report on S. 3067 was the availability of adequate service for taxpayers residing in Alaska and Hawaii.

", "The committee raised several issues regarding IRS enforcement activities in its report on the bill. Perhaps the most pressing issue concerned taxpayer identity theft and related refund fraud and the steps being taken by the IRS to remedy the problem. Such fraud arises when someone intentionally uses the personal identifying information of another person to file a falsified tax return with the intent of receiving a fraudulent refund. The scope of the problem has grown in the past few years: according to a study by the National Taxpayer Advocate. IRS's inventory of identity-theft cases at the end of FY2015 was 150% greater than the inventory at the end of FY2014. In a bid to spur the IRS to do more to combat identity theft, the committee ordered the agency to make it a top priority to develop stronger safeguards to prevent identity theft and faster ways to assist taxpayers who are the victims of such a crime, drawing upon the recommendations in recent reports by the GAO, TIGTA, and the NTA. Under S. 3067 , the IRS would be required to report to the committee within 90 days of the enactment of the bill on its plans for addressing the problem. In addition, the committee directed the IRS to assign each identity-theft case to a single contact person at the agency and to report back to the appropriations committees on how long it takes, on average, for such an approach to resolve the case.", "Another issue was the processing of applications to determine the federal employment tax status of workers under the SS-8 program. The committee maintained that staffing for the program had failed to keep pace with its growing workload in recent years. The classification of a worker as an independent contractor or employee has significant tax implications for employers, workers, and the IRS. At issue is whether an individual or an employer is primarily responsible for paying Social Security, Medicare, and federal unemployment taxes and for withholding federal income taxes. In 1994, the IRS established the Determination of Worker Status Program to permit an employer or a worker to request an IRS determination of a worker's status as an employee or independent contractor; the program is now known as the SS-8 program. According to a 2013 TIGTA report, the inventory of cases and processing times increased from FY2009 to FY2012; more recent estimates are not available. In January 2012, the IRS began using a new method for prescreening requests for worker status determinations intended to speed up the process. The committee directed the IRS to notify the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, the Ways and Means Committee, and the Senate Finance Committee before reducing or reassigning staff for the program.", "Operations Support", "S. 3067 would have provided the IRS with $3.638 billion in appropriations for operations support in FY2017, the same as the amount enacted for FY2016 but $393 million less than the budget request.

To monitor the results and costs of these investments and the steps taken by the IRS to protect taxpayer information from cyberattacks, the committee instructed the IRS to provide both appropriations committees and the GAO with quarterly reports in FY2017 on the following IT projects: IRS.gov, Returns and Remittance Processing, EDAS/IPM, Information Returns and Document matching, E-services, Taxpayer Advocate Service Integrated System, implementation of the ACA, and \"other projects associated with significant changes in the law.\" Each report should discuss cumulative expenditures and performance schedules for each project in previous fiscal years, its cost and schedule for the previous three months, and the expected cost and schedule for the next three months. The report should also relate when the project began, its expected date of completion, the percentage of the planned work already completed, the current usefulness of the technology, and any anticipated changes in its schedule for completion.", "As an added layer of scrutiny, the committee directed the Treasury Department to review IRS's IT investments every six months to \"ensure the cost, schedule, and scope goals are transparent.\" The GAO is already required to submit an annual report to both appropriations committees on the cost and results of all major IRS IT projects in FY2017, especially those addressed in IRS's quarterly reports.", "Business Systems Modernization", "S. 3067 recommended that the BSM program receive $290.0 million in appropriations in FY2017, the same amount that was enacted for FY2016 but $53.4 million less than the budget request.", "In its report on the bill, the committee again expressed concern about the ability of the IRS to prevent cyber-criminals from gaining access to sensitive taxpayer information and using it to file falsified tax returns. This concern sits atop a long-standing concern about the risk of cost overruns and delays in getting the desired results from BSM projects. ", "Exercising its oversight authority, the committee instructed the IRS to continue to submit quarterly reports in FY2017 on the cost and performance schedules for two projects: CADE2 and MeF. The reports should note when the projects began, their expected dates of completion, the percentage of planned work completed, changes in schedule, and risks unrelated to funding amounts.

IRS's full-time equivalent workforce directly funded through appropriations decreased by 12,774 FTEs (or 13.1%) from FY2010 to FY2016.

In FY2010, 74% of taxpayer calls to the IRS for live assistance were answered; the average wait was 10.8 minutes. By contrast, 38.1% of calls were answered in FY2015, with an average wait of 30.5 minutes. The IRS expects the level of telephone service to rise to 47%, and the average wait to drop to 25.8 minutes in FY2016. During the 2015 and 2016 filing seasons, new internal IRS rules restricted IRS customer assistance employees to answering basic tax questions, and TACs were not allowed to prepare tax returns for low-income, disabled, and elderly taxpayers seeking assistance. The IRS conducted fewer audits of individual and large corporate tax returns in FY2015 relative to FY2010. For individual audits, the decrease was 22.3%, and for corporations with assets of $10 million or more, it was 27.4%. The overage rate for IRS correspondence with taxpayers more than doubled from FY2010 (20.3% of all correspondence received) to FY2015 (49.4%). According to IRS internal rules, a correspondence is considered overage if it is not resolved within 45 days of the IRS receiving it. From 2010 to 2016, the number of individual tax returns processed by the IRS (through July of each year) rose nearly 7 million (or 5.0%). The IRS has had to take on two new major responsibilities since FY2010: implementing the ACA and FATCA. Cases involving taxpayer identity theft and refund fraud have increased considerably in both volume and the amount of improper payments since FY2010. ", "A primary concern of proponents of a larger IRS budget is that continued declines or slow or no growth in the resources available to the IRS would further erode the effectiveness of taxpayer services, delay or cancel the implementation of critical new business systems, increase the frequency and magnitude of tax evasion and identity theft, make the IRS more vulnerable to cyberattacks aimed at stealing taxpayer information, and undermine taxpayer confidence in the fairness and efficacy of the federal income tax system.", "Opponents of substantial increases in the IRS budget (or proponents of additional cuts) generally do not dispute the evidence cited by proponents. Rather, they argue that increases in the IRS budget cannot be seriously considered until the IRS demonstrates repeatedly over an extended period that it is able to perform certain \"critical\" tasks. One is to establish sound spending priorities and pursue them effectively with available resources. A second task is to take advantage of opportunities for greater program efficiencies and cost savings. Another task is to regain the trust of taxpayers, which was deeply shaken by allegations that surfaced in 2013 that the IRS discriminated against politically conservative social welfare organizations in evaluating their applications for tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(4). ", "Critics also maintain that with careful planning and appropriate allocations of the hundreds of millions of dollars in user fees the IRS collects each year, it should be able to meet its mandated responsibilities and make notable progress in achieving its strategic objectives, while making the changes required to satisfy the demands of critics. ", "The arguments for and against an expansion of the IRS's budget raise at least two questions for lawmakers: ", "Given the strategic goals, statutory responsibilities, and mounting workload of the IRS, what is the appropriate size of the IRS budget and how should it be allocated among the IRS's various functions? Is the current IRS budget sufficient to allow it to (1) reduce the federal tax gap, (2) uphold the integrity of a tax system that relies on voluntary compliance to raise needed revenue, (3) provide the services taxpayers demand to meet their tax obligations, (4) keep individuals from hacking into the IRS taxpayer databases to steal personal information and file fraudulent tax returns, (5) recruit and train younger workers to replace employees who retire or resign for other reasons, and (6) develop and install the information systems needed to increase the range of taxpayer services offered online?", "Increased Funding for Enforcement and Operations Support through Program Integrity Cap Adjustments", "The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA, P.L. 112-25 ) amended the BBEDCA by reinstating limits on discretionary budget authority that lapsed at the end of FY2002. The current discretionary caps apply from FY2012 to FY2021. Section 251(b) (2) of the BBEDCA authorizes certain adjustments to the spending caps after the enactment of appropriations. Under the BCA, the limits on discretionary spending can be adjusted for the following reasons:", "changes in budget concepts and definitions, appropriations designated for requirements for emergencies, appropriations designated for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism, appropriations for continuing disability reviews and redeterminations, appropriations for controlling health care fraud and abuse, appropriations for disaster relief.", "The adjustments for health care fraud and abuse and for disability reviews and eligibility redeterminations allow for additional appropriations to carry out program integrity initiatives, which are activities intended to bring about a net reduction in federal spending, in part through a reduction in improper benefit payments. In each case, the adjustment must exceed a specified minimum amount of appropriations for those activities and cannot exceed a specified maximum amount. Those amounts vary from year to year between FY2012 and FY2021. This requirement is intended to ensure that the additional funding does not supplant other federal spending on these activities or is not diverted to other purposes .", "The Obama Administration asked Congress to provide added funding for IRS enforcement activities and operations support in FY2017 through a program integrity cap adjustment for collecting delinquent taxes (and related penalties and interest charges) and reducing improper refund payments. If it had been adopted, the request would have amended the BCA to allow for a series of adjustments to the discretionary spending limits for new investments by the IRS from FY2017 to FY2026. In FY2017, the adjustment would have totaled $514.7 million in budget authority and outlays. According to an IRS estimate, the proposed new investments over that decade would have resulted in the collection of $64 billion in additional revenue at a cost of $18 billion, yielding a net savings of $46 billion.", "Every budget request for the IRS since FY2006 has included a program integrity cap adjustment for enforcement funding. Congress enacted such a proposal for FY2006, FY2009, and FY2010, but not for FY2011 to FY2015. ", "In reviewing future IRS budget requests, Congress may want to consider the advantages and disadvantages of paying for increases in IRS's enforcement activities through such an adjustment. ", "Revenue Effects of IRS Appropriations", "Under current federal budget scorekeeping rules, any budgetary savings (such as increased revenue) from additional appropriations for government administrative programs is not counted as an offset to that spending. This rule goes back to the scorekeeping guidelines included in the conference report for the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 ( P.L. 101-508 ) and reaffirmed in the conference report for the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 ( P.L. 105-33 ). The guidelines are intended to ensure the consistent treatment of the budgetary effects of government programs over time. They can be changed only with the unanimous consent of all budget scorekeepers: the House and Senate Budget Committees, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and the Office of Management and Budget. ", "For the IRS, this convention has meant that even though some of its activities raise substantial additional revenue, the additional receipts cannot be used under congressional pay-go rules to finance tax cuts or spending increases. For example, a proposed decrease in IRS funding of 50% from the amount enacted in FY2016 would be scored as a reduction in the baseline federal budget deficit of approximately $5.4 billion in FY2016; by contrast, a proposed 50% increase in FY2016 funding would be treated as an increase in the federal budget deficit of the same amount. In both cases, even if the proposed changes in IRS funding were to affect IRS's enforcement activities only, the increase or decrease in receipts would not alter the projected federal budget deficit in FY2017.", "Such a limitation also applies to the budgetary impact of other government compliance activities, such as measures to prevent improper Medicare payments or improper claims for federal student loans. A key justification for the limitation is that it deters federal agencies with enforcement budgets from shifting resources to collection functions to justify requests for larger budgets for their programs.", "By contrast, estimates of the revenue effects of legislative proposals to alter tax laws sometimes reflect both the indirect and dynamic revenue effects. H.Res. 5 (Adopting Rules for the 114 th Congress) requires the CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) to incorporate the macroeconomic effects of major legislation in their official estimates of the cost effect used to enforce the budget resolution and other House rules. Major legislation is defined as legislation with a \"gross budgetary effect\" equal to or greater than 0.25% of the projected GDP for the fiscal year to which the budget resolution applies. ", "Some argue that the current practice of disregarding the revenue effects of changes in IRS funding leads Congress to appropriate less than it otherwise should, especially for enforcement activities. A change in IRS funding may affect taxpayer compliance in ways that generate an indirect revenue effect. This effect is not scored under current scorekeeping rules. Yet the JCT does score the indirect revenue effects of proposed tax code changes.", "In deciding how much in appropriations the IRS receives, Congress may wish to take into account the net contribution of IRS's administration of the federal tax code to the federal budget."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}]}}
