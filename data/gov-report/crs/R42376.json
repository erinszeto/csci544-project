Instead, the Administration has proposed a new strategic plan for the Pacific AOR that provides for U.S. rotational forces in Australia, Singapore and the Philippines, a reduced presence of U.S. marines permanently based in Guam, and a planned shift of 2,500 marines from Okinawa to Hawaii.

No funding was requested in the fiscal year 2012 budget for military construction related to tour normalization in Korea, but the Committee will expect detailed cost information and a completed business case analysis, approved by the Secretary of Defense, for the strategic objectives that to this point have driven the decision to implement tour normalization, before approving any funding requests in future years. This business case analysis should clearly articulate the strategic objectives, identify and evaluate alternative courses of action to achieve those objectives, and recommend the most cost-effective alternative.", "Finally, the Senate Committee on Armed Services incorporated into S. 1253 , its version of the NDAA for FY2012, Section 2113, which would bar any funds from being obligated or expended in support of tour normalization until", "DOD's Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) conducts an appropriate analysis of alternatives to the program being pursued by the Army, the Secretary of the Army submits a master plan detailing the schedule and costs for the needed facility and infrastructure construction, and subsequent legislation authorizes such obligation.", "This provision had originally been enacted as Section 2111 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 ( P.L. 112-81 ).", "Section 2107 of the House version of the NDAA for FY2013 ( H.R. 4310 ) continues this prohibition through FY2013, while the Senate bill ( S. 3254 ) contains no such provision.

So, for example, a large hospital may be built in phases, with each phase yielding a usable wing and the final phase completing the structure. Incremental funding does not require a usable structure. Funding, rather than construction, is staged.", "This has led to controversy between the executive and legislative branches. The typical executive position has held that full budget authority should be allocated to projects when requested, while appropriators have suggested that this practice could over-commit limited budget authority in a given fiscal year to a few large projects to the detriment of other needed construction. Therefore, Congress has proven more receptive to incremental construction than the executive. This is reflected in a statement found in the report accompanying the Senate version of the military construction appropriation (S. 3215):", "In general, the Committee supports full funding for military construction projects. However, it continues to be the practice of the Committee to provide incremental funding for certain large projects, despite administration policy to the contrary, to enable the services to more efficiently allocate military construction dollars among projects that can be executed in the year of appropriation. For fiscal year 2013, the Committee recommends incremental funding for the following projects: High Performance Computing Center, increment 2, Fort Meade, Maryland; U.S. STRATCOM Replacement Facility, Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska; Cadet Barracks, U.S. Military Academy, West Point, New York; Hospital Replacement, Fort Bliss, Texas; and Explosives Handling Wharf 2, Kitsap, Washington."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Air Force Reserve Component Command and Infrastructure", "paragraphs": ["Section 1701 through Section 1709 of the Senate-reported version of the NDAA would create a \"National Commission on the Structure of the Air Force.\" This eight-member commission, appointed by the chairs of the armed services committees and the President, and would study and report on the force structure needed to support certain goals. In order to prevent the Air Force from taking any actions that could preclude any potential commission findings or recommendations, the bill would prevent the expenditure of any FY2013 funding to remove, or prepare to remove, any Air Force aircraft from the Reserve Component units to which they were assigned as of May 31, 2012 (except C-5A aircraft under certain conditions). The bill would then authorize the appropriation of $1.4 billion \"for the purpose of freezing Air Force structure in place or as planned... .\" If enacted, this provision would retain at their current locations all Reserve Component aircraft through the end of FY2013.

In each case, the Secretary has insisted that these installations do not fall within the parameters of 10 U.S.C. 2687, the permanent base closure statute, which imposes limitations on actions to close or realign installations where a certain number of authorized civilian personnel actions would be affected. In Section 2704 of the bill, the committee charges the Comptroller General with submitting a report to the congressional defense committees that would include the \"objective criteria to be used by the Department of Defense to make decisions relating to realignments of units employed at military installations that are not covered by the requirements of section 2687 of title 10, United States Code, and closures of military installations that are not covered by such requirements.\"", "Of more immediate effect, the section would bar any action prior to October 1, 2013, that \"would result in a military installation covered under paragraph (1) of section 2687(a) of title 10, United States Code, to no longer be covered by such paragraph.\" The cited subsection brings under the statute \"the closure of any military installation at which at least 300 civilian personnel are authorized to be employed.\" This refers to a change in the authorized civilian manning at any military installation currently exceeding 300 positions that would result in an authorization below that number. The closure of installations falling within Section 2687 requires notification to Congress at the time of the annual defense budget request with an accompanying detailed justification for the closure and a wait of a certain number of days before implementation. This provision could prevent certain actions that would have the effect of sidestepping this requirement. Nevertheless, because the Secretary has consistently maintained that the civilian manning at each of the installations slated for closure already does not meet Section 2687 levels, this proposed section by itself may not materially affect those closures."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
