For instance, it has been suggested that this emphasis on supporting the military was acontributing factor in the Intelligence Community's failure to provide advance notice of the Indiannuclear test in May1998, at a time when U.S. reconnaissance satellites were primarily tasked withthe support of U.S. military forces operating in the Persian Gulf region.

The DCI has to direct agencies without controlling them. He does notreceive an appropriation for their activities, and therefore does not control their purse strings. Hehas little insight into how they spend their resources. Congress attempted to strengthen the DCI'sauthority in 1996 by creating the positions of deputy DCI for community management and assistantDCIs for collection, analysis and production, and administration. But the authority of these positionsis limited, and the vision of central management clearly has not beenrealized.

I want no resources or people spared in this effort, either inside the CIA or the [Intelligence]Community.", "These were strong words. Rather than having a galvanizing effect, however, the Joint Inquiry record suggests that the Intelligence Community continued to be fragmented without a comprehensivestrategy for combating Bin Ladin. The Joint Inquiry concluded that the DCI was either unable orunwilling to enforce consistent priorities and marshal resources across the Community. (15)", "Simply put, the Joint Inquiry argued that, although DCI George Tenet put the Intelligence Community on a war footing against Al Qaeda, his writ did not run beyond the CIA to other partsof the Intelligence Community, including the major Pentagon agencies. Accordingly, the JointInquiry and the 9/11 Commission as well as others have urged that there should be a single seniorofficial, having the title Director of National Intelligence or National Intelligence Director,responsible for managing the entire Intelligence Community, including NSA, the NRO, and the NGAalong with the CIA and other intelligence entities.", "Management and budgetary authority has been seen as needed to control national intelligence agencies of the Community.

From their perspective, the problem in large measureinvolved the CIA and the FBI and, among DOD agencies, primarily NSA which had to work withinthe constraints of the \"wall\" in regard to surveillance of U.S. persons. The 9/11 Commissioncriticized NSA's \"almost obsessive protection of sources and methods, and its focus on foreignintelligence, and its avoidance of anything domestic....\" (22) It is noteworthy, nevertheless, that the 9/11Commission's list of ten missed opportunities for stopping the plot does not cite a misstep by NSAor any other DOD agency. (23)", "Criticisms of proposals to establish a DNI/NID centered on the possibility (or likelihood) that they would undermine the authority of the Secretary of Defense over agencies that are closelyintegrated into the operational capabilities of the military services. Writing in June 2004, formerDCI Robert Gates argued that:", "More than 80 percent of foreign intelligence dollars are spent by agencies under the control of the secretary of defense. Virtually all of those agencies havetactical, combat-related tasks to perform for the Pentagon and the military services, in addition tothe roles they play under the guidance of the director of central intelligence. In the real world ofWashington bureaucratic and Congressional politics, there is no way the secretary of defense or thearmed services committees of Congress are simply going to hand those agencies over to anintelligence czar sitting in the White House. Indeed, for the last decade, intelligence authority hasbeen quietly leaching from the C.I.A. and to the Pentagon, not the other wayaround.

The ability to feedelectronic data to units on the battlefield through digital pipelines is essential for the kind ofnetwork-style warfare that has proved so effective in Iraq and Afghanistan. Combat forces use moreof this data than anyone else. It seems odd that anyone would want to drag several intelligenceorganizations out of the Defense Department simply to create a new mega-organization whose mainmission would be ... supporting the Defense Department. (25) ", "Another longtime observers of U.S. intelligence agencies, Richard Betts of Columbia University, wrote in mid-2004: \"Trying to wrest the National Security Agency and like agenciesfrom the Defense Department ... would leave Capitol Hill and Pennsylvania Avenue awash inblood.... The military services will never accept dependence on other departments for performanceof their core functions, which include tactical intelligence collection, and politicians will not overridemilitary protests that their combat effectiveness is being put at risk.\" (26)", "Such views were undoubtedly shared by some current and former DOD officials. In April 2004, months prior to the President's August 2nd announcement, USD(I) Cambone testified that \"we earlyconcluded that the relationship between intelligence and operations was growing closer -- so close,in fact, that it was beginning to become increasingly difficult to separate the two....\" Expressingskepticism about plans to increase the role of the DCI or create a DNI, Cambone argued that,\"...absent the [current] deep and abiding relationship between the DCI and the Secretary of Defense,it is easy to see the ways in which seams would begin to grow up between organizations and inwhich the Department of Defense would not be benefi[t]ted and in fact, the intelligence communityas a whole be hurt by that split. So sustaining the existing relationship, we think, is essential.\" (27)", "Cambone's testimony echoed testimony offered in 1996 by John P. White, then the Deputy Secretary of Defense in the Clinton Administration, in regard to earlier legislation to reorganize theIntelligence Community: \"Confusing the clear lines of authority that currently exist would make itmore difficult for DOD intelligence elements to perform their most important mission -- supportto the warfighter. In the drive to create a strong Intelligence Community, we must not damage theintegration of military intelligence within the Defense Community.\" (28)", "Concerns within DOD persisted. On October 21, 2004 General Richard Myers, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote to the Representative Hunter, Chairman of the House ArmedServices Committee, maintaining that:", "... the budgets of the combat support agencies [including NSA, NRO and NGA] should come up from the agencies through the Secretary of Defense to theNational Intelligence Director, ensuring that required warfighting capabilities are accommodated andrationalized and ensuring that the Secretary meets his obligations.

Implying that organizational issues were not necessarily the key factor, they assert thatthe Intelligence Community's failure \"to connect the dots\" before the 9/11 attacks resulted in largemeasure from barriers to communications between foreign intelligence agencies (such as the CIA)and law enforcement agencies (especially the FBI). (29) These barriers were in many cases purposefullyerected in regulations in order to ensure that foreign intelligence agencies would not be used to targetU.S. persons (as had occurred on earlier occasions when intelligence agencies zealously investigatedgroups and individuals opposed to the Vietnam War). ", "After 9/11, Congress adjusted these barriers through provisions in the USA-Patriot Act of 2001 ( P.L. 107-56 ) and other legislation. The USA Patriot Act authorized the sharing of law enforcementand foreign intelligence information. In addition, the Homeland Security Act ( P.L. 107-296 )provided that the Intelligence Analysis and Infrastructure Protection component of the Departmentof Homeland Security (DHS) would receive and analyze foreign intelligence and law enforcementinformation relating to terrorist threats to the U.S. Subsequently, the Bush Administrationestablished the Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC) to perform integrative analyticalfunctions. (30) Such initiatives have arguably torndown (or at least significantly lowered) the \"wall\"between foreign intelligence and law enforcement that may have contributed to the failure to detectthe 9/11 plot in advance. These developments, according to some observers, affect the need forenhancing the powers of a proposed DNI/NID.", "Ongoing technological innovations are also, according to some observers, working to remove long-established barriers. The phenomenon of \"stovepiping\" whereby imagery, humint, or sigintwould be collected by separate agencies in the field and forwarded to respective Washington-areaheadquarters to be processed and analyzed before being made available to users has received muchcriticism. Stovepiping, in essence, means the control of information by collection agencies. Inevitably, processing, transmission and forwarding lead to delays and impede the effort to bring allavailable data to bear on the intelligence needs of all levels of government.", "The dangers of \"stovepiping\" are now widely recognized. DIA Director Lowell Jacoby testified to the two intelligence committee's Joint Inquiry:", "... the more widely information is shared, the more likely its hidden meaning will be revealed. Information considered irrelevant noise by one set ofanalysts may provide critical clues or reveal significant relationships when subjected to analyticscrutiny by another. This process is critical for the terrorism issue where evidence is particularlyscant, often separated by space and time. (31)", "Well before 9/11, the Defense Department was taking advantage of new technologies to provide intelligence support to its forces. Real-time intelligence has been especially important in the use ofprecision munitions, allowing targeting of specific targets while minimizing casualties. Defenseintelligence agencies are acquiring capabilities to collect comprehensive data, to provideinstantaneous transmission, data storage, and immediate retrieval at all echelons. In many casesprocessing and analysis is undertaken at sites within the U.S., even Washington-area headquarters(a process known as \"reachback\"), and can be directly accessed by military units around the worldto support ongoing tactical operations. ", "Observers, such as Berkowitz, have suggested that, rather than undertaking revision of complex statutes, efforts should be focused on generating \"the political will needed to make all intelligenceorganizations implement a truly common set of security standards that balance the importance ofkeeping secrets with the importance of sharing information.\" (32) Berkowitz notes that Executive Order12333, which serves a charter document for the Intelligence Community, is over 20 years old andneeds revision, an effort that, in his view, \"would be a faster, more effective vehicle for intelligencereform than a commission report or legislation. Such an order could also resolve the security barriersand other hurdles that currently keep intelligence agencies from working together more effectively.\"", "In October 2002 testimony before the Joint Inquiry, DIA Director Jacoby argued that a crucial need is \"to create a new paradigm wherein 'ownership' of information belong[s] with the analystsand not the collectors.\" Jacoby argued that the government should follow industry's practice inadopting a standard for data storage that permit retrieval from multiple users at different agencies:", "If we are to achieve an end state characterized by the ability to rapidly share and integrate information, we must move toward a common data frameworkand set of standards that will allow interoperability -- at the data, not system, level.... And, thesooner the better, not just for a limited group of intelligence producers and subsets of data; itshouldn't be an elective option. Interoperability at the data level is an absolutely necessary attributeof a transformed intelligence environment because it enables horizontal integration of informationfrom all sources -- not just intelligence -- at all levels ofclassification. (33)", "Many observers believe that stovepiping can be gradually overcome because of the availability of technology for rapid dissemination of operational data and the press of operational requirementsas occurred during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Outside observers argue that technological capabilitiesnow permit increasing information sharing with reliable security protection. (34)", "The effort to promote wider sharing of information is widely supported, but there remain obstacles. Singling out NSA, the Senate Intelligence Community warned in 2003 of continuingresistance to such innovations:", "The Committee has become increasingly concerned in recent years about bureaucratic and cultural obstacles to effective information and data sharing...", "Cutting-edge analytical tools, many of which are already in use in the private sector, increasingly involve large-scale, multi-database analysis and patternrecognition. Using such approaches within the Intelligence Community, however, cannot proceedfar without a significant revision of current orthodoxy as to information 'ownership' andcontrol.

In particular, provisions authorizing the DNI to directallocations and allotments of appropriated funds gives the DNI significant leverage in the acquisitionand program management efforts of intelligence agencies in DOD. (39) Some Members believed thatthis leverage would amount to a degree of control inconsistent with the Secretary of Defense'sresponsibilities for managing intelligence agencies in DOD that also support the combat forces. Although the proposed language clearly establishes extensive budgetary authorities for the DNI,other factors such as the role of the personalities of the respective officials, the priorities of theincumbent administration, and the influence of congressional guidance will also have significantinfluences.", "Moreover, the final version of the legislation includes a provision (Section 1018) that requires the President to issue guidelines to ensure the effective implementation of authorities granted to theDNI, the Director of the OMB, and cabinet heads \"in a manner that maintains, consistent with theprovisions of this act, the statutory responsibilities of the head of the departments of the UnitedStates Government with respect to such departments.\" The guidelines are to be issued within 120days of the appointment of the first DNI.

Some observers suggest, however, that this issueis not clear-cut. The legislation gives the DNI authority to apportion funds and the apportionmentprocess affects the timing and rate of the flow of funds. Nevertheless, the authority to apportion andallocate appropriated funds does not automatically translate into the authority to direct day-to-dayoperations. There are already well-established distinctions between responsibilities for acquisitionprograms on the one hand, and responsibilities for operational command on the other. The militarydepartments (the Departments of the Army, Navy and Air Force) have major responsibilities for theacquisition of systems to be used by the operating forces, but ongoing operations are controlled bythe unified commands (e.g. Central Command, European Command, Pacific Command) at thedirection of the Secretary of Defense and the President.

The DCI has long had authority to coordinate such tasking inresponse to NSC guidance.

NGA acknowledges that authority to establish priorities derivesfrom the authorities of the DCI rather than solely from those of the Defense Department.
