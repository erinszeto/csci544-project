{"id": "R41101", "title": "FEMA Disaster Cost-Shares: Evolution and Analysis", "released_date": "2013-04-04T00:00:00", "summary": ["The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (The Stafford Act, P.L. 93-288) includes the Public Assistance (PA) program, Sections 406 and 407 of the act. These sections provide assistance to states, local governments and non-profit organizations for debris removal and rebuilding of the public and non-profit infrastructure. The Stafford Act is a partnership between the federal and state governments and part of the partnership is the notion that state and local governments should have some \"skin in the game.\" That is, they should contribute toward some of the costs incurred by the disaster response and recovery programs. The division of costs between federal and state governments is known as a \"cost-share.\" The language of the Stafford Act defining cost-shares for the repair, restoration, and replacement of damaged facilities provides that the federal share \"shall be not less than 75 percent.\" These provisions have been in effect for over 20 years. The Stafford Act also gives the President the authority to adjust some of the cost-shares. While this authority is long standing, the history of FEMA's administrative adjustments and Congress' legislative actions in this area, are of a more recent vintage.", "In all, there have been 245 cost-share adjustments of varying sizes and lengths of time dating back to 1986. In 1998 FEMA promulgated regulations that provide a more consistent and open approach to cost-share adjustments. The overwhelming majority of these cost-share adjustments have been based on that regulatory authority and carried out by the executive branch through administrative actions. However, since 1997, and particularly in the wake of the difficult issues caused by the Gulf Coast storms of 2005, Congress has begun to exercise its authority to adjust cost-shares. The recent trend toward legislative cost-share waivers suggests that Congress may have an interest in continuing to influence the federal/state relationship in providing resources to respond to disaster situations.", "The cost-share regulation establishes eligible per capita disaster damage amounts that could qualify a state for cost-share reductions. The per capita amounts are updated on an annual basis. With the adjustment process formalized in regulation, and with larger disasters more frequent in succeeding years, the cost-share waivers have also become more common. Certainly the interest in achieving such a reduction for the state and local share has grown with the awareness of the cost-share adjustments during large disaster events such as Hurricane Katrina. Beyond actions by the executive branch, Congress has adjusted cost-shares through legislation when a state or states may not, or have yet to meet, the per capita threshold. FEMA and the Clinton administration adjusted the cost-shares for some states affected by the 1993 Mississippi River flooding that had not met the per capita policy amount.", "In 2007, Congress adjusted the cost-shares following the Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005 for states that did not meet the identified threshold and also waived cost-shares for programs other than the PA program. Most recently, in P.L. 111-32, Congress again adjusted the state cost-shares for the two states most impacted by Hurricane Ike in 2008. The legislation also waived the cost-share for two other states, separate from the hurricane area, with major disaster declarations that did not meet the qualifying threshold. There have been multiple cost-share adjustments for the Hurricane Sandy major disaster declarations. Broader administrative cost-share adjustments for the major disaster declarations for Hurricane Sandy will depend on whether the eligible per capita disaster damage totals mandated by regulation are reached. While the expenditures for Sandy are large, so too are the populations in the affected states.", "Under the Insular Areas Act, a different threshold is implemented for U.S. territories that provides a more generous cost-share for smaller disaster events in several of the territories. Cost-share waivers have also been frequently applied.", "Cost-share waivers can be a great help to a state and its communities seeking to recover from a disaster event and reeling from the economic problems caused by the disaster. But such waivers also reduce the supplemental nature of Stafford Act funding through the increase of the federal share. How such cost-share waivers are administered is an issue that FEMA has addressed through regulation and Congress has addressed through legislation. This report will be revised as warranted by events."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Historical Cost-Share Thresholds: Authorities and Regulations", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Authorities", "paragraphs": ["FEMA's cost-share policy for the public assistance program that repairs, restores or replaces public facilities of all kinds (buildings, roads, public utilities, water and sewer projects, etc.) was part of the original Disaster Relief Act of 1974. That statute authorized the President to help state and local governments in the repair or replacement of public facilities and mandated that \"the federal contribution for grants made under this section shall not exceed 100 per centum of the net cost.\" However, the defined cost-share commitments (not the waivers) were originally established by regulation in 1980. As one observer explained,", "The nonfederal contribution to all other assistance remained subject to negotiation until May 1980, when FEMA administratively adopted a general policy of requiring state and local governments to agree to pay 25 percent of the eligible costs of public assistance programs. This policy removed the administrative problem associated with attempting to determine a \"reasonable\" commitment for each disaster. ", "This administrative policy was codified into law in amendments to the Stafford Act contained in P.L. 100-707 , in 1988:", "Minimum federal share \u2013 Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Federal share of assistance under this section shall not be less than 75 percent of the eligible cost of repair, restoration, reconstruction, or replacement carried out under this section."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulations", "paragraphs": ["Currently, a state must have accumulated more than $133 in damages per capita within the state to reach a traditional cost-share waiver for sections 403, 406 and 407. Sections 403, 406 and 407 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act ( P.L. 93-288 , the Stafford Act) address emergency assistance, infrastructure damage and debris removal. These sections all share the same statutory language regarding the federal share; that it \"shall not be less than 75 percent of the eligible costs.\" The cost-shares are reflective of the Stafford Act's fundamental insistence on state participation and that the State \"will comply with all applicable cost-sharing requirements of this Act.\"", "Emergency assistance (Section 403) can entail overtime payments for safety personnel, reimbursements for actions the state has taken such as executing an evacuation plan or sandbagging to prevent additional flooding. It can also include the provision of federal resources (equipment, supplies, contracted assistance) referred to as Direct Federal Assistance, such as providing temporary facilities for essential community services such as temporary classrooms for schools.", "Section 406 is the repair or replacement of public infrastructure. The actual categories are: A \u2013 Debris Removal, B \u2013 Emergency Protective Measures, C \u2013 Road Systems and Bridges, D \u2013 Water Control Facilities, E \u2013 Buildings, Content and Equipment, F \u2013 Utilities, and G \u2013 Parks, Recreational Facilities and Others. Also, non-profit organizations may be eligible for this form of assistance if they are providing \"critical services\" such as power, water, water treatment, emergency medical service or other similar service. ", "Assistance for debris removal under Section 407 is generally used (with some exceptions) for the removal of debris from publicly owned lands. Typically this aid involves clearance of debris from main public roads to provide access for the community to their homes, jobs and public services.", "Information provided by FEMA indicates that the larger cost-share adjustment, affecting Public Assistance categories C through G, has been done 54 times, amounting to about 21% of all cost-shares and occurring for less than 0.5 % of all major disasters declared since 1985. These figures point to an exceptional event being needed to qualify a state for the reduction in cost-share. An adjustment of the cost-share from 25% state and local share of a project to 10%, as proscribed in regulation, can greatly reduce the costs of the disaster for state and local governments while increasing federal expenditures.", "As noted earlier, the state and local cost-share had been placed in regulation in 1980 and was then codified in law in 1988. But the greatest attention to the cost-share, and provisions for its adjustment, were made in the spring of 1993. ", "The cost-share amount was set at $64 per capita for the Midwest floods of 1993. FEMA increased this amount through rulemaking initiated with a proposed rule in 1998 and set in regulation in April of 1999. The rule stated that the $64 amount had been in use since 1985, so bringing it up to current dollars in 1999 would set the per capita amount at $75. The rule then increased the effective amount to $85 beginning on January 1, 2000, to $100 per capita on January 1, 2001, and then adjusted that amount for inflation after January 1, 2002, based on the Consumer Price Index. As of 2013, the per capita amount of damage required for a cost-share adjustment is $133. That amount far exceeds the per capita costs that FEMA employs when determining if an incident qualifies for a disaster declaration."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FEMA's Cost-Share Rule", "paragraphs": ["In comments on the proposed rule for cost-share adjustments, several parties noted that there was no analysis of the original per capita threshold and that any raising of that amount would not consider individual state capabilities and would also discourage states from taking mitigation measures that would limit the impact of future disasters. FEMA's response indicated that since the base threshold amount had not been changed for a number of years it was in need of adjustment.", "Rather, the $64 threshold is simply a yardstick to determine when the economic impact of a disaster is of such severity that it warrants recommendation for a cost-share adjustment. We are quite willing to work with our state partners to identify capability or mitigation measures that might justify consideration of a cost-share adjustment. However, we view that as a longer-term effort separate from this rule. With respect to measuring economic impact, no commenters offered alternatives to the use of a per capita impact although two did suggest that we lower the threshold to $50 per capita. We believe instead that the 1985 threshold should be brought up to current dollars and adjusted annually using the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, since that is the legislative basis for annually adjusting the small project grants under the Public Assistance Program and grants under the Individual and Family Grant Program.", "Some have questioned whether the per capita amount employed by FEMA is reasonable based on average per capita amounts of damages for major disaster declarations. Some postulate that the per capita threshold may be set at too high an amount for most states to qualify for a reduced cost-share. Others suggest that the threshold is set at an appropriate level that signals an extraordinary event meriting special consideration for a reduced state and local share.

For other events, such as Hurricane Floyd that hit North Carolina in 1999, the cost-share waiver was not made until one year later, when the accumulated total eligible costs had surpassed the state per-capita threshold. The time involved in determining whether a state has reached its threshold can be important, since many decisions made at the state and local level are based on the amount of cost-share that the entities anticipate when selecting and prioritizing projects.", "As of February 2013, a total of 244 cost-share adjustments have been made for major disaster declarations over the last 24 years.

The time periods involved have ranged from 48 hours all the way up to 319 days.

The invocation of this waiver during the \"initial days\" is not commonplace but has happened frequently.

This represents a more limited but, some might argue, more targeted approach to assisting the state during the emergency phase.", "It can be argued that it is valuable for FEMA to have this option available early on in a disaster in order to act quickly and decisively in ways that aid state and local governments in accomplishing emergency missions. This vital early work, such as the clearing of debris from major roads, can contribute to an expedited recovery.

As one observer noted in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina: ", "State and local officials, for their part, have been called in by Congress to testify on how the intergovernmental response to disasters ought to go.

However, a closer examination suggests that at the time of the adjustment, total cost projections for the nine states totaled $900 million. Even with the large hazard mitigation grant program that followed those floods, it seems unlikely that disaster costs ever reached 0.1% of a Gross Domestic Product in 1993 of more than $6.6 trillion.

But the adjustment, it can be argued, was important to lessen administrative confusion since all of the parishes designated for assistance due to Hurricane Ike had also been designated just two weeks earlier for Hurricane Gustav.", "The decision to include Louisiana was also similar to previous congressional cost-share actions that sought to include all states affected by a chain of disaster events. This approach was used on cost-share adjustments for Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Dennis and Wilma as discussed in the previous section. But along with those cost-share waivers, the supplemental legislation also included similar waivers for disasters that occurred in Kentucky and West Virginia earlier in the spring of 2009. Those disasters were declared based on severe storms and flooding. However, the per capita damage amounts in both states were far below the per capita qualifying criteria.

The initial declarations for Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York were for 10 days with a 100% federal cost-share.

In that event, the Bush Administration established the federal nature of the contribution early in the process.

One observer suggested that the cost-shares in 1992 reflected not only the major damage incurred but the political realities of the time as well.", "Two weeks after Hurricane Andrew, Hurricane Iniki struck Hawaii, causing intense devastation on the island of Kauai. No direct legislative response ensued from the Andrew/Iniki disasters since the Bush administration would soon leave office. In the midst of his re-election campaign, however, President Bush enlarged the federal share of disaster assistance in both recovery efforts to virtually 100 percent. ", "Similar suggestions of political influence have been made regarding disaster cost-share assistance decisions made during ensuing administrations, ascribing political motivations, as both disaster damage and disaster costs have grown. Two researchers asserted that presidential and congressional influence have an impact on the decisions for declarations and spending.", "We find that presidential and congressional influences affect the rate of disaster declaration and allocation of FEMA disaster expenditures across states. States politically important to the President have a higher rate of disaster declaration by the President, and disaster expenditures are higher in states having congressional representation on FEMA oversight committees. ", "While those findings comported with suspicions or assumptions of political corruption of the disaster declaration process and disaster spending, follow-up studies have questioned those assumptions. As two other researches have noted:", "There was no statistical evidence to suggest that gubernatorial and presidential party similarity, U.S. House of Representatives and presidential party similarity, FEMA congressional oversight committee membership, electoral votes, or FEMA regional office location influenced success in securing emergency or major disaster declarations.", "Another researcher who has closely followed disaster declaration activity noted the declining rate of turn downs for governors' requests and concluded:", "Since 1989, following adoption of the Stafford Act, the odds that the president will approve a governor's request have risen to about four in five (80.3 percent) chance. Certainly the broader authority to judge what is or is not a disaster under the Stafford Act has provided president's since 1988 with more latitude to approve unusual or \"marginal\" events as disasters or emergencies. This may be one reason for the higher rate of gubernatorial request approvals since 1988.", "An additional reason for the increase in approvals may also rest with the increasing capacity of states to make effective requests and understand and anticipate FEMA's review process and what would likely constitute a request that would result in a declaration.", "While this discussion and these studies focused on various forms of disaster declaration decisions and overall spending, none of these studies has focused on the cost-share adjustments that have been made by the executive and legislative branches. These changes have generally comported with regulations in place or have been done within a context of overall help to a region. But some other cost-share waivers for disasters that do not approach the damage per capita threshold indicate a potential openness for increased congressionally directed spending for all disasters. ", "In a sense, this takes the issue full circle to a time when Congress legislated assistance by specific incident and proscribed the form and amount of the assistance. As one observer has noted:", "The U.S. Congress was not entirely unmoved by these and other disasters: Between 1803 and 1947, 128 specific acts expressed sympathy and sometimes supplied token financial assistance. ", "Obviously now the assistance available is well beyond token, and in fact, the negligible contribution could conceivably be the state's share. This is the exception since most states have a clear interest in the recovery work that is reflected in their work and commitment. But regulatory cost-share waivers, if applied broadly and without the compelling support of recent congressional legislative waivers, could chip away at that commitment and complicate, rather than strengthen, the federal-state partnership"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["The cost-shares for the funding of Stafford Act programs speak to the cooperative working relationship reflected in that legislation between the two levels of government in addressing disaster response and recovery work. While waivers can grant needed relief to states that have absorbed a great deal of disaster damage, those same waivers can undercut the state's investment, not only in resources but also in its oversight and accountability, in contributing to its own recovery. ", "The adjustment of cost-shares is likely to remain a subject of interest to all states and localities that receive a major disaster declaration and have an interest in reducing their state commitment of resources during the recovery process. All discussions of cost-shares over the last four years lead back to the hurricane season of 2005 and the damage inflicted by Hurricane Katrina. The damage Katrina delivered has also affected public policy expectations. Hurricane Katrina was an outlier in its size and impact, yet many legislative modifications meant to adapt solely to that storm and its unprecedented aftermath, are now used as rationale for suggesting identical treatment for subsequent disasters. ", "Congress may continue, after future disasters, to consider legislative adjustments to Stafford Act cost-share requirements, examining the need for exceptions to current regulatory waivers or expanding such waivers. Congress may wish to consider if the threshold currently employed appropriately reflects state capacities and commitments toward disaster recovery. ", "Recent congressional actions demonstrate a recognition of the financial burdens caused by disaster damage, while also demonstrating a willingness to adjust cost-share amounts for events that are not of the scope and size associated with previous cost-share adjustments. Just as with Katrina for large events, these adjustments for lesser damage can also push public policy expectations. The resulting additional assistance provided to states and localities, through more generous cost-shares, increases the overall disaster costs to the federal government. ", "For the last decade the federal government has begun to budget for disaster spending through greater annual appropriations. While not entirely accounting for all disaster spending, the increases in annual budgets for the Disaster Relief Fund reflect a lessening of the dependency on emergency spending for that purpose. Within this new reality, the cost-share adjustments, and their increase of the federal share, could begin to impinge on the annual budget choices faced by the Obama Administration and Congress."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
