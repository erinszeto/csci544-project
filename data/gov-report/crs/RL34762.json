Several states and industry, agriculture, business, and environmental and public health advocacy groups petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, challenging certain aspects of EPA's revisions. A February 24, 2009, decision by the D.C. Circuit granted the petitions in part, denying other challenges, and remanded the standards to EPA for further consideration but did not specifically vacate the 2006 PM standards. EPA initiated its next round of the periodic review of the PM NAAQS, in part, in response to the court's decision and on June 29, 2012, published a proposal to strengthen the standards. These actions, and the ongoing implementation of the 2006 PM NAAQS, have prompted renewed interest among Members of Congress.", "Experiences and issues leading up to and following the promulgation of the 2006 PM2.5 NAAQS could provide relevant insights as EPA proceeds with its current review. Although a tightening of the standards, the particulates NAAQS established in 2006 were not as stringent as recommended by EPA staff or the independent scientific advisory committee mandated under the Clean Air Act (Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, or CASAC). The divergence from the CASAC's recommendations proved controversial, as did several other elements of the 2006 particulates NAAQS, including the decision not to exclude rural sources from the coarse particle standard.", "EPA found that the evidence continued to support associations between exposure to particulates in ambient air and numerous health problems. Based on several analytical approaches, EPA estimated that compliance with the revised NAAQS would prevent 1,200 to 13,000 premature deaths annually, as well as substantial numbers of hospital admissions and missed work days due to illness. EPA revised the PM NAAQS by strengthening the 1997 standard for \"fine\" particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter (PM2.5). Specifically, the agency lowered the allowable daily concentration averaged over 24-hour periods of PM2.5 in the air from 65 micrograms per cubic meter (\u00b5g/m3) to 35 \u00b5g/m3. The annual PM2.5 standard, which is set in addition to the daily standard to address human health effects from chronic exposures to the pollutants, was unchanged from the 1997 standard. The decision not to tighten the annual standard was overturned by the D.C. Circuit and remanded to EPA for consideration.", "The 2006 particulates NAAQS also retained the 24-hour standard and revoked the annual standard for slightly larger, but still inhalable, particles less than or equal to 10 micrometers (PM10). EPA abandoned its proposal to replace the particle size indicator of PM10 with a range of 10 to 2.5 micrometers (PM10-2.5). The D.C. Circuit's February 24, 2009, decision upheld EPA's decisions with regard to PM10 NAAQS.", "EPA's ongoing implementation of the 2006 NAAQS, including EPA's November 13, 2009, final designation of those geographical areas not in compliance (typically defined by counties or portions of counties), has been an area of debate among some Members of Congress, states, and other stakeholders. Although EPA did not require new nonattainment designations for PM10, the tightening of the PM2.5 standard resulted in an increased number of areas in nonattainment compared to the designations for the 1997 PM NAAQS. EPA's November 2009 final designations for the 2006 PM NAAQS included 120 counties and portions of counties in 18 states as nonattainment areas based on 2006 through 2008 air quality monitoring data."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["EPA has identified and promulgated National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) under the Clean Air Act (CAA) for six principal pollutants commonly referred to as \"criteria pollutants\": particulate matter (PM), ozone (O 3 , a key measure of smog), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 , or, inclusively, nitrogen oxides, NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx, or, specifically, SO 2 ), carbon monoxide (CO), and lead (Pb). On October 17, 2006, EPA published its revisions to the NAAQS for particulates to provide protection against potential health effects associated with short- and long-term exposure to particulate matter (including chronic respiratory disease and premature mortality).", "EPA's revised particulates NAAQS modified the standards established in 1987 that focused on particles smaller than 10 micrometers (PM 10 , or coarse particles), and standards for \"fine\" particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers (PM 2.5 ) introduced for the first time with the promulgation of the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS. Specifically, the agency lowered the allowable daily concentration averaged over 24-hour periods of PM 2.5 in the air from 65 micrograms per cubic meter (\u00b5g/m 3 ) to 35 \u00b5g/m 3 . The annual PM 2.5 standard, which is set in addition to the daily standard to address human health effects from chronic exposures to the pollutants, was unchanged.

EPA's review of the particulates NAAQS and of the scientific criteria for setting the standards completed in 2006 was initiated not long after the 1997 promulgation.", "The 2006 particulates NAAQS generated national interest and debate, and oversight in Congress, as did the previous changes to the particulates standards promulgated in 1997. While the 2006 particulates NAAQS generally tightened the air quality standards for fine particulate matter, the action caused considerable controversy, including concerns that the standards were outside the range recommended by both EPA staff and by the scientific advisory panel (Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, or CASAC ) established by the CAA. Conversely, some contended that available data did not support the need for stricter standards or, in some cases, the standards as promulgated in 1997. ", "A February 24, 2009, decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to grant, in part, petitions challenging certain aspects of EPA's revised NAAQS generated renewed interest in the PM NAAQS. In December 2006, 13 states, the District of Columbia, and several state agencies had petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to review the 2006 particulates NAAQS. In addition, several groups representing various industry and agriculture interests (including coal, iron, steel, and corn refiners, oilseed processors, farmers, and cattle and pork producers), as well as environmental and public health organizations, filed petitions with the D.C. Circuit challenging the 2006 NAAQS. Petitioners, joined by several interveners and amici, challenged both the fine and coarse particulates standards.", "The court's decision did not vacate the PM standards but remanded certain aspects of the annual PM 2.5 standard to EPA for reconsideration; the petitions did not challenge the tightening of the daily (24-hour) standard. Although implementation of the 2006 PM NAAQS continues, EPA initiated its statutorily required review of the PM NAAQS, in part in response to the decision, not long after the 2006 promulgation of the PM NAAQS. EPA staff reassessed scientific studies considered in setting the 2006 PM NAAQS revisions, reviewed and analyzed extensive subsequent research, and considered public comments and recommendations of the CASAC. Based on the scientific evidence considered, EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson signed the proposal that would tighten the current standard primarily by lowering the annual health-based (\"primary\") standard for PM 2.5 . The proposal includes options for new secondary standards to address visibility impacts in urban areas associated with PM 2.5 , but did not modify the standards for inhalable coarse particles smaller than 10 micrometers (PM 10 ).
