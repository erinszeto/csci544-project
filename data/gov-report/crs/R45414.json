It defines an eligible patient as one who (1) has been diagnosed with a life-threatening disease or condition, (2) has exhausted approved treatment options and is unable to participate in a clinical trial involving the eligible investigational drug (as certified by a physician who meets specified criteria), and (3) has given written informed consent regarding the drug to the treating physician.", "It defines an eligible investigational drug as an investigational drug (1) for which a Phase 1 clinical trial has been completed, (2) that FDA has not approved or licensed for sale in the United States for any use, (3) that is the subject of a new drug application pending FDA decision or is the subject of an active investigational new drug application being studied for safety and effectiveness in a clinical trial, and (4) for which the manufacturer has not discontinued active development or production and which the FDA has not placed on clinical hold.", "The RTT Act also has provisions that limit how the Secretary of Health and Human Services (through the FDA) can use data regarding clinical outcomes of patients who get these drugs through the RTT pathway; require drug sponsors (usually the manufacturers) to report annually to the Secretary on use of the pathway; and require the Secretary to post certain annual summaries. Finally, the RTT Act states that the sponsor or manufacturer has \"no liability\" for actions under the RTT provisions. The no-liability provision applies also to a prescriber, dispenser, or \"other individual entity\" unless there is \"reckless or willful misconduct, gross negligence, or an intentional tort.\"", "Before the RTT Act, observers discussed several obstacles to access to investigational drugs. These included some that were FDA-related: the difficult process to request FDA permission and the role of FDA as gatekeeper. Some related to why a manufacturer might decline to provide an investigational drug: limited available supply, liability, limited staff and facility resources, and concerns about use of outcomes data. The RTT directly eliminates some of these concerns, addresses some others, and leaves others alone.", "Future Congresses could look at the RTT Act's effect on FDA, drug manufacturers, and terminally ill patients. Will more patients get investigational drugs? Congress could look at whether the law sufficiently removed obstacles to access. And how will the changes affect FDA? Four former FDA commissioners warned that the bill would \"create a dangerous precedent that would erode protections for vulnerable patients.\" The first clue may come from how the current commissioner interprets FDA's role in the implementation of the new law."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try (RTT) Act of 2017 became federal law on May 30, 2018.

It developed a new form that a physician could use when requesting expanded access for an individual patient. It reduced the amount of information required from the physician by allowing reference (with the sponsor's permission) to the information the sponsor had already submitted to FDA in its IND. When a patient needs emergency treatment before a physician can submit a written request, FDA can authorize expanded access for an individual patient by phone or email, and the physician or sponsor must agree to submit an IND or protocol within 15 working days.", "Coincident with discussions preceding passage of the RTT Act, FDA had commissioned an independent report on its expanded access program.

The laws vary on the detail required in the informed consent and liability issues of the manufacturer and the patient's estate. However, several experts had suggested that this state law approach is unlikely to directly increase patient access. Before passage of the federal RTT Act, analysts raised questions about how federal law (the FFDCA), which required FDA approval of such arrangements, might preempt this type of state law.

Over time\u2014and perhaps with requesting other data\u2014Congress could determine whether the law has had the effect its sponsors intended. Second: Has the law removed the obstacles to access to investigational drugs? While the RTT Act achieves proponents' objective of removing the FDA application step in a patient's quest for an investigational drug, it does not address many of the obstacles\u2014such as a limited drug supply or limits on staff and facility resources\u2014that could lead a manufacturer to refuse access to its drugs. And it is not clear whether it sufficiently deals with the obstacles it does address\u2014use of clinical outcomes data and liability protection. The reporting required by the RTT Act was not designed to answer those questions. But Congress could turn to the Government Accountability Office for help. It could also encourage manufacturers, patient advocates, and FDA to collaborate in the search for answers. Third: How will this affect FDA? One news article referred to the RTT Act's \"bizarre twist,\" as FDA must determine its role in implementing a law whose function is to remove FDA from the situation. Commissioner of Food and Drugs Gottlieb and Senator Johnson, the sponsor of the Senate bill, have exchanged statements that potentially foretell conflict if FDA issues rules that would limit the law's scope. Finally, is the RTT Act a harbinger of reduced authority for FDA? Writing in opposition to the bill, four former FDA commissioners warned that it would \"create a dangerous precedent that would erode protections for vulnerable patients.\" That is something future Congresses may choose to address. By trying to help one set of ill patients, does Congress wear down the health of the institution meant to protect the public's health?", "The RTT Act concludes with a \"Sense of the Senate\" section that appears to acknowledge that this legislation offers minimal opportunity to patients. It is explicit in asserting that the new law \"will not, and cannot, create a cure or effective therapy where none exists.\" The legislation, it says, \"only expands the scope of individual liberty and agency among patients.\" The drafters realistically end that phrase with \"in limited circumstances.\""], "subsections": []}]}}
