However, Congress provides significant federal funds to help states exercise this responsibility ($7.9 billion appropriated in FY2008). Most of this support is provided for children who are in foster care and who meet specific federal eligibility criteria. This report discusses the federal framework for child welfare policy; reviews the scope of activities, and children and families served, by state child welfare agencies; summarizes several child welfare-related hearings that were held in 2007; describes child welfare and related legislative proposals that have been introduced in the 110th Congress; and reviews child welfare programs for which funding authorization has expired or is set to expire on the last day of FY2008.", "Child welfare agencies seek to ensure the well-being of children and their families, including protecting children from abuse or neglect and ensuring that they have a safe and permanent home. In FY2006 child protection agencies found 905,000 children to be victims of abuse or neglect. Some of these children were removed to foster care, some remained in their homes and received services, while others received no further follow-up from the agency. After reaching a recorded high of 567,000 on the last day of FY1999, the number of children in foster care has declined by about 10%, and on the last day of FY2006, an estimated 510,000 children were in foster care. Less than half of these children are eligible for federal foster care support under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act.", "Legislation that would respond to a number of the concerns raised in 2007 child welfare hearings has been introduced in the 110th Congress. These proposals would expand the eligible populations served with Title IV-E funds to include (potentially) all children in foster care or adopted (with special needs) from foster care (H.R. 5466, H.R. 4207, S. 2900, S. 1462, H.R. 4091, and S. 3038), as well as children leaving foster care for legal guardianship with a relative (S. 661, H.R. 2188, H.R. 5466, and S. 3038), and youth who choose to remain in foster care until their 21st birthday (S. 1512, H.R. 4208, S. 2560, and H.R. 5466).

These representatives of various state and local entities investigate allegations of child abuse and neglect, provide services to families in their own homes, remove children from homes if necessary, and supervise and administer payments for children in out-of-home settings.", "Federal involvement in child welfare is tied to the financial assistance it provides to states to conduct these activities. In FY2008, Congress appropriated just under $7.9 billion for child welfare purposes. The bulk ($4.6 billion) of this money was appropriated to reimburse states for the cost of providing foster care for children who meet federal eligibility criteria (estimated 43% of national foster care caseload in FY2006). Beginning in the early 1960s, the federal government has paid for part of the cost of foster care for children who would have been entitled to federally assisted cash welfare had they continued to live in their own homes. (In essence, the cash aid was expected to follow the child into foster care.) States had primary responsibility to pay the full foster care costs for other children who were removed from their homes. In the 1996 welfare reform law ( P.L. 104-193 ), Congress ended the entitlement to cash aid for needy families with children and converted funding for this purpose to a block grant. At the same time, it continued to require that only children removed from homes that would have met the eligibility requirements for cash aid under the state's pre-1996 welfare-reform rules would be eligible for federal foster care assistance.", "As a condition of receiving these foster care and other child welfare funds, states are required to abide by a series of federal child welfare policies. Federal child welfare policies focus, overall, on ensuring safety and well-being for all children served. However, the most specific and extensive requirements are designed for the protection of children in foster care, especially to ensure them a safe and permanent home. These protections must generally be provided to all children in foster care, regardless of whether they meet federal foster care eligibility criteria. State compliance with the majority of these federal requirements is checked as part of the Child and Family Services Review (CFSR). A state that is not in \"substantial conformity\" with federal child welfare policy\u2014as determined by the review\u2014must implement a Program Improvement Plan ( PIP). The state typically has two years to implement a PIP.

The rate of reported child maltreatment victims has been about 12 children per 1,000 children in the national population in every year since 1999. This rate is well below the recorded highs in the early to mid-1990s (1992-1996), when the rate ranged around 15 victims for every 1,000 children in the population and the number of child victims was counted as more than 1 million annually. (See Table 1 .) For FY2006, states reported 64% of child victims experienced neglect, 16% were found to have experienced physical abuse, 9% sexual abuse, 7% psychological maltreatment, 2% medical neglect, and 14% \"other abuse.\" These shares were fairly constant between 2000 and 2006, although the rate of children found to have experienced neglect increased somewhat while the rate of children found to have experienced physical abuse or sexual abuse declined somewhat.", "Preliminary estimates show 510,000 children were in foster care on the last day of FY2006 (or about 6.8 per every 1,000 children in the general population). This represents a modest decline from the estimated 511,000 children in care on the last day of FY2005, but is well below the recorded high of 567,000 children in care on the last day of FY1999 (when there were about 8.0 children in foster care per 1,000 in the population). (See Table 1 .)", "Overall, the national foster care caseload declined by about 10% between FY1999 and FY2006; however, this decline has not been shared by all states. Between FY1999 and FY2006 (most recent year state-level data are available), less than half of all the states (24, including Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia) reported reductions in their foster care caseload, ranging from a less than 1% decline in Connecticut (40 children) and Michigan (200 children) to a nearly 47% decline in Illinois (16,000 children). Along with Illinois, California and New York posted the greatest numerical and percentage change declines in their caseloads between the last days of FY1999 and FY2006: California's caseload dropped by close to 40,000 children (34% decline); New York's caseload declined by more than 21,000 children (41% decline). Over the FY1999-FY2006 time period, slightly more states (27) posted increases in their caseloads. These ranged from an increase of about 3% (more than 300 children) in Massachusetts to increases of 93% (close to 900 children) in Idaho, 89% in Texas (nearly 15,000 children) and 86% in Iowa (more than 4,000 children). In addition, five states (WY, SD, OK, AZ, and WV) saw caseload increases in their foster care caseloads ranging from roughly one-third to two-thirds between the last day of FY1999 and the last day of FY2006.", "The overall number of children in care on the last day of a given year rises or falls depending upon both the number of entries to foster care, that is children who are removed from their homes in a given year, and the number of exits in that same year, that is children reunited with their families, adopted, emancipated, or placed in another permanent setting. Nationally, the number of children reported as having exited foster care has risen from an estimated 250,000 in FY1999 to an estimated 289,000 in FY2006. (However, this is understood as an undercount because some states do not report all exits from foster care. ) Nationally, the number of children who entered foster care may be trending up. During FY2006 (most recent year for which data are available), the number of children who entered foster care in FY2006 was estimated as 303,000 compared to 293,000 children who entered in FY1999. Table 1 indicates that this represents a rate of about 4.1 children per 1,000 in the population in both of those years. However, during the period of greatest recorded decline in the national caseload, FY2000 through FY2004, the rate of children entering foster care also declined, reaching a low point of 3.9 in FY2003.", " Table 1 shows national estimates of the total number and the rate (i.e. the number of children per 1,000 in the population) who were found to be victims of child maltreatment, who entered foster care, and who were in care on the last day of the fiscal year."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Scope of Children and Families Served", "paragraphs": ["Federal child welfare policy has sometimes been considered synonymous with foster care policy, and most federal dedicated funding and policy proscriptions are related to children in foster care.

Many of these allegations were \"screened out,\" and no further attention was given to the case. A screen out might occur because the alleged behavior does not match the state definition of child abuse or neglect, because the case is transferred to another agency (considered by the child protective services agency to be more appropriate), because not enough information was provided to follow up on the allegation, or for other reasons. In the end, states conducted investigations or assessments of abuse or neglect involving some 3.6 million children during FY2006 and found more than 905,000 children to be victims of child abuse or neglect. States also reported providing post-investigation services to an estimated 1.3 million children, including some of those who were found to be victims as well as some who were not found to be victims. Most of these children (77%) were served in their homes, and the remainder were removed to foster care.", "Although the number of children receiving some services after the investigation (1.3 million) exceeds the number of victims (905,000), not all victims received post-investigation services. Instead, the data reported by states suggest that roughly three out of every five victims received any services following the investigation. Overall, states reported that, among children found to be victims of child maltreatment, an estimated 22% were removed to foster care, and roughly equal portions of the remaining victims were either served in their homes (37%) or received neither in-the-home nor out-of-the home services following the investigation (41%). Among the children who were not found to be \"victims\" in the investigation, states reported that more than 4% were removed to foster care, close to 26% received services in the home, and the remaining 70% received neither in-the-home nor out-of-the-home services following the close of the investigation.", "Finally, during FY2006, states reported serving some 799,000 children for at least one day (24 hours) in foster care.

In general, these bills propose to determine what portion of all state's total foster care and adoption assistance costs (whether incurred on behalf of a IV-E eligible child or a non-IV-E eligible child) is now provided by the federal government, and would ensure that this same national level of commitment be continued into the future. To achieve this, each state's current reimbursement rates under the Title IV-E program (except those related to training, and development and operation of a data collection system) would be reduced by the same percentage. At the same time, H.R. 5466 and H.R. 3409 would provide a three-year period, following the enactment of these changes, during which any state that received fewer federal foster care or adoption assistance dollars because of lowered federal reimbursement rates, could submit additional claims to receive funding at the level they would have received under prior law.

Special needs criteria are any factors that a state determines make it unlikely that a child will be adopted without adoption assistance (or medical assistance). These criteria vary by state but must include a determination by the state that the child cannot or should not be returned to the home of his parents, and they often address some or all of the additional factors suggested in federal law, including ethnic background, membership in a minority or sibling group, medical conditions, or physical, mental, or emotional handicaps.", "The number of children receiving Title IV-E adoption assistance in an average month has grown dramatically in the recent past\u2014from 106,200 in FY1995 to more than 390,900 in FY2007. The Administration predicts continued growth and estimates that in an average month in FY2009, 430,400 children will receive this assistance. The growth in the number of children receiving federal adoption assistance is consistent with the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (ASFA, P.L. 105-89 ), which among other things encouraged states to expeditiously aid the adoption of children out of foster care (when returning home is not possible for them). Some states had begun to increase these efforts even before this legislative change, and between FY1995 and FY2000, the number of children adopted with public child welfare agency involvement nearly doubled (from 25,700 to 51,100).

In FY2006, some 13,300 children left foster care to be adopted by a relative; a somewhat greater number (15,000) left foster care for legal guardianship (most of these placements are presumed to be with relatives), and many more left care to live with a relative in some other (less formal) arrangement (30,800).

Further, this research found that children placed in subsidized guardianships cited as positive both an increased sense of stability and loss of the \"stigma\" of foster care, while their caregivers pointed to their enhanced ability to make decisions for the child around health care, family visits, and education as a principal advantage of guardianship over foster care.

Advocates of federally supported subsidized guardianship argue that financial support is critical for relatives to assume care and that many relatives cannot afford to assume care of children outside of the foster care system. According to a nationally representative survey, close to two out of every three children (estimated 66%) who were placed in a kinship care arrangement\u2014after an investigation of alleged abuse or neglect in their own home\u2014were placed in households with income below 200% of the federal poverty threshold, including some 40% who went to live in households with incomes below 100% of the federal poverty level.", "Relative caregivers are currently eligible for varying levels of financial support depending on their legal relationship to the child and the licensing or other policies of the state in which they live. Relatives may receive foster care maintenance payments if they serve as formal foster parents for a relative child. However, those payments may not be Title IV-E (federally) subsidized unless the relative meets the state's licensing standards and approval process. Similarly, children who exit foster care to relative adoption may be eligible for a Title IV-E adoption assistance payment (but only if that relative meets specific background check requirements). Some (unlicensed) relatives caring for children in formal foster care may instead receive a Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) \"child-only\" benefit, and this may also be true for children who exit foster care to either an informal relative-care arrangement or to a more formal relative guardianship. TANF child-only benefit levels vary by state but are typically worth significantly less than a foster care maintenance payment. (A 2004 study of child-only benefits in five states found that, depending on the number of children a relative cares for, a TANF child-only benefit may represent as little as 22% of the foster care maintenance rate or as much as 82%.)", "Some children who exit foster care to a legal guardian may receive support through a state-established subsidized guardianship program.

Some, but not all, states require these adults to be relatives, and most require that the child was previously in foster care (under the responsibility of the state). Typically states rely entirely, or in some part, on state and local funding to operate subsidized guardianship programs. However, nine states (IL, IA, MN, MT, NC, OR, TN, VA, and WI) have child welfare demonstration projects (waivers) specifically allowing federal Title IV-E funds to provide guardianship payments, although these programs, generally, may not operate on a statewide basis.

They also suggest that a single model is unlikely to meet the range of needs among child welfare-involved families, given the different ages and developmental needs of the children in these families, and because the parenting skills most deficient in a family where neglect is the main issue are likely different from those where physical abuse (or child behavior) is the major reason for child welfare involvement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Infant Safe Haven", "paragraphs": ["S. 2237 would require states receiving certain newly proposed funding (related to law enforcement and victims assistance) to have in place an \"infant safe haven\" law that includes specific provisions related to the legal and anonymous relinquishment of care and responsibility for a newborn.

That analysis showed that safe haven providers are defined in state laws to include a variety of settings, including hospitals, emergency medical services, police stations, and fire stations; states have defined a range of ages under which an infant may be legally relinquished to a safe haven provider (but most provide a limit between three days and one month); typically these state laws provide for the relinquishing parent's anonymity and that no abandonment charges may be filed (except in cases where child abuse or neglect is indicated) and that the parent(s) relinquishing the baby may not be compelled to provide personal information (or accept information offered); and many states require the safe haven provider to ask the parent for family and medical history information (although in some states the safe haven provider is required to attempt to give the parent(s) information about the legal effects of leaving the infant and information about referral services). Finally, children relinquished to a safe haven provider are typically transferred to the custody of a child welfare agency, which is expected to petition for the termination of the parental rights of the child's birth parents and to seek an adoptive home for the child. Some states permit the relinquishing parent to petition to reclaim his or her parental rights typically within a specified time period and a smaller number of states have provisions for a father who did not relinquish the child to petition for the child's custody.", "Advocates of safe haven laws believe they will reduce the number of infants discarded (or abandoned) in dangerous places, preventing risk to the newborns and possible death. Eliminating the fear of prosecution, they argue, enables a desperate birth parent to act in the child's best interest and ensure the child's safety, even when the parent does not feel able to personally care for the child. Others argue that the laws encourage irresponsible behavior and might induce birth parents to simply relinquish the child rather than to seek additional support and services. By allowing birth parent anonymity, they further argue that important medical or other genetic information may be lost forever to the child. Further, they add that these laws might interfere with the parental rights of fathers, if they are unaware of the baby's birth and subsequent relinquishment. Some practical considerations in implementing the laws have included ensuring public awareness of the laws (so that pregnant women and their partners know about this option) as well as ensuring knowledge of the law's provisions among employees at safe haven providers.

(This proposal was first included in the President's FY2003 budget and has been in every successive one as well.) According to FY2009 budget documents, the proposal is intended to be \"budget neutral\" and would give states the option to receive their foster care funding as a flexible grant over five years to support a continuum of services for families in crisis and children at risk.\" ", "No specific legislative language to enact this plan has been introduced. However, the Administration has indicated that under this \"flexible funding\" plan, states could choose to receive their foster care funding as an annual pre-established grant amount (rather than as open-ended reimbursement of eligible expenses) for a period of five years. The amount of a state's annual grant funding during those years would be based on the funding that the state would be assumed to receive under the Title IV-E foster care program (as it exists in current law) over those same five years. States could use the grant funds for the full range of child welfare services, including foster care payments, prevention activities, permanency efforts, case management, administrative activities, training for child welfare staff, and other similar child welfare activities. Further, the funds could be spent on any child without regard to whether this child met the Title IV-E foster care eligibility criteria that are part of the AFDC-program link. (The Administration's proposals would not make any changes to the current Title IV-E Adoption Assistance program, which also includes this eligibility link.)", "At the same time, the FY2009 budget documents note that states would be required to uphold \"child safety protections outlined in the Adoption and Safe Families Act,\" agree to maintain existing levels of state investment in child welfare programs, and continue to participate in the HHS-administered Child and Family Services Reviews (to ensure compliance with federal child welfare policy). States experiencing a \"severe foster care crisis\" would, under certain circumstances, be able to tap TANF contingency funds to meet this unanticipated need. Finally, the President's proposal includes a $30 million set-aside to be available for Indian tribes (tribes are currently not eligible to directly receive federal foster care funds under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act) and a one-third of 1% set-aside for monitoring and technical assistance of state foster care programs.", "Recommendations of the Pew Commission", "In May 2004, the Pew Commission on Children in Foster Care, co-chaired by former Representatives Gray and Frenzel, released a set of recommendations to restructure the current federal child welfare system. Those recommendations have guided some aspects of introduced bills (in this and prior Congresses) and they remain a part of the child welfare financing debate.", "De-Link Payments", "The Commission recommended removing the income eligibility requirements for Title IV-E adoption assistance and foster care maintenance payments\u2014now in law as part of the link between the Title IV-E program and the prior law AFDC eligibility requirements (discussed above)\u2014and continuing mandatory and \"open-ended\" funding for the program. To reduce the federal cost of this expanded eligibility, it further recommended that the share of each foster care maintenance or adoption payment reimbursed by the federal government be reduced. Those reimbursement rates now range from 50% to 83%, depending on the state's per capita income, and the Pew Commission proposed an even 35% reduction (i.e. new funding matching rates of roughly 32.5% to 54.0%). To ensure that the lower reimbursement rates would not result in some states receiving less federal support for adoption subsidies and foster care maintenance payments than under current law, the Commission also recommended a three-year adjustment period during which states would at a minimum receive the same level of funding that would have been available to them before the adjustment of the program eligibility criteria and the reimbursement rate. Thus, the Commission believes this de-link proposal would be cost neutral to both the federal and state governments.", "Service, Case Management, and Training Funds", "The Commission further recommended a single \"Safe Children, Strong Families\" grant program be created to provide capped, mandatory funding that states would not be able to use for foster care maintenance payments but that they could spend on virtually any other child welfare purpose, including providing services to children and their families, casework support for children, and training of child welfare, court and other relevant personnel.", "The Commission recommended that this grant be created by combining the capped funding now available to states under Title IV-B of the Social Security Act (Child Welfare Services and Promoting Safe and Stable Families) with some of the open-ended funding now available under Title IV-E for states to conduct specified administrative and child placement activities. The initial grant funding level would be based on the total amount of current funding for each of these funding streams (estimated at about $3.7 billion at the time of the proposal) enhanced by $200 million in the first year (for a total of about $3.9 billion). The Commission proposed that states would receive a share of this money based on the share of the total pot of money they receive under current law. Further, the Commission proposed that this grant should be indexed so that each state's funding would annually grow by 2% plus the inflation rate (Consumer Price Index).", "Under current law, the federal government provides between 50% and 75% of the total eligible program costs for the programs that would be rolled into the Safe Children and Strong Families grant. The Commission recommended adjusting this rate to create a single federal matching rate that would ensure no state had to provide more of its own funding to receive the same level of federal support. It estimated that this federal share (matching rate) would be about 68%. Finally, with regard to other funding currently provided under Title IV-E, the Commission recommended that states continue to be able to claim open-ended reimbursement for the development, maintenance, and operation of a State Automated Child Welfare Information System (SACWIS) at the current federal reimbursement rate of 50%.", "Other Pew Financing Recommendations", "Among other recommendations, some of which had previously been proposed in Congress, the Commission recommended that assistance payments for children who exit foster care to a legal guardianship be reimbursed by the federal government on an open-ended basis (under Title IV-E), proposed that Indian tribes be granted the ability to make direct claims for federal reimbursement under the Title IV-E programs, and sought to remove current limits set on the amount of Title IV-E funding that may be accessed by the territories.", "It further proposed that current law adoption incentive payments be revamped to permit states that successfully found permanent homes for children (whether via family reunification, adoption, or guardianship) to receive these bonus funds; sought provisions that would permit states to transfer (\"re-invest\") certain \"unspent\" Title IV-E foster care dollars in the Safe Children, Strong Families Grant; recommended payment of an enhanced federal matching rate for the Safe Children, Strong Families Grant\u2014if a state showed increased competence and reduced caseloads among its child welfare workforce; proposed investment of at least some of a state's assessed penalties for noncompliance with federal child welfare policy in that state's Program Improvement Plan (with this spending directed by HHS) and, finally, recommended continued reservation of funds for research, evaluation, and sharing of best practices.", "The Partnership Recommendations", "In May 2007, eight organizations representing public human services administrators and employees, as well as private child welfare service providers, researchers, and advocates, formed a partnership to propose child welfare reform. Stating that the \"federal-state partnership to help children and families must be renewed and strengthened,\" this partnership produced a list of reform proposals\u2014many of which are related to federal financing. The eight organizations included in the partnership are the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), American Public Human Services Association (APHSA), Catholic Charities USA, Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP), Child Welfare League of America (CWLA), Children's Defense Fund, National Child Abuse Coalition, and Voices for America's Children. The partnership proposals are not provided in legislative form. However some of the proposals have been addressed in legislation introduced in this Congress and described in the body of the report. A brief review of the proposals is given below.", "The partnership seeks to \"guarantee services, supports and safe homes for every child who is at-risk of being or has been abused or neglected.\" It proposes to do this by amending Title IV-E of the Social Security Act to permit states to use those funds on a broader range of purposes and \"without converting any of the Title IV-E to a block grant.\" The partnership calls for expanded federal eligibility for Title IV-E foster care through elimination of the income eligibility criteria (de-link from AFDC). (It does not propose a reduction in reimbursement rates or another mechanism that would limit increased cost from this change to the federal government.) And it further proposes that any state that safely reduces its foster care caseload should be able to \"reinvest\" the federal Title IV-E funds, which would otherwise be lost to the state, in services and supports that prevent abuse or neglect. The partnership would further stipulate that any savings in state spending that might accrue because of these changes must be similarly reinvested.", "The partnership further proposes that states should be able to use Title IV-E funds to (1) provide post-permanency services to children reunited with their parents, placed permanently with a relative, or adopted, and to help older youth who age out of foster care successfully transition to adulthood and (2) provide subsidized guardianship for children placed with legal guardians (when neither reuniting with parents nor adoption is appropriate). The proposal also calls for direct tribal access to Title IV-E funding and suggests that states be permitted to establish relative-specific licensing standards, provided those standards contain safety protections and criminal background checks.", "For most states, the partnership would increase the federal matching rate available to states under the Title IV-E program for casework activities\u2014including assessment of child and family needs, development and refinement of permanency plans, recruitment, licensing and supervision of foster and pre-adoptive parents. Under current law, states may seek federal reimbursement of 50% of the cost of such caseworker activities (provided they are incurred on behalf of Title IV-E eligible children), which is the general reimbursement rate for Title IV-E program \"administrative\" costs. The partnership proposes to change this matching rate for caseworker activities under the Title IV-E program to the state's Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), which may range from 50% to 83% with states that have higher per capita income receiving lower rates and vice versa. Further, the partnership proposes to permit states to use child welfare funds withdrawn (penalties) or disallowed by the federal government to conduct evaluations of promising approaches to achieve safety, permanency, and well-being for children and implement approaches that have been demonstrated to improve these outcomes for children.", "The partnership further proposes to expand both the range of topics and the kind of workers for whom states may seek federal Title IV-E training support at the 75% reimbursement rate. Under current law, states may receive reimbursement of training costs at the 75% rate if the topic is related to administering the Title IV-E foster care or adoption assistance program, and only on behalf of public employees. Training topics that are specifically not eligible for Title IV-E reimbursement include those related to providing services, including training on how to conduct a child abuse and neglect investigation, or how to provide treatment or other services related to domestic violence, mental health issues, or substance abuse among children and families coming into contact with the child welfare agency. The partnership proposes to permit federal Title IV-E reimbursement at the 75% matching rate for any training topic related to \"ensuring safety, permanency and well-being for children,\" and further, it would permit states to make these claims on behalf of private child welfare agency workers, court personnel, and other social service agency workers (including those with expertise in health, mental health, substance abuse, and domestic violence related services).", "Finally, the partnership proposes to \"enhance accountability\" by requiring states to report annually on funds spent on particular services and categories of services; the number of children and families served; the duration of the services; and the number of children and families who are unable to access a service for which they are referred. Five years after the enactment of these reforms, the partnership would call on the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) to evaluate the effectiveness of the reforms as they relate to (1) enhancing preventive, permanence, and post-permanency services; (2) changes in foster care placements; (3) recruitment, retention, and workloads of child welfare workers; and (4) improved outcomes for children at-risk of entering, or who have entered, the child welfare system. Finally, to \"increase the knowledge about outcomes for children,\" the partnership would permit states to submit additional state-level data during the Child and Family Services Review (CFSR) process.", "Appendix B.
