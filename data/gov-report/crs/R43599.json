For example, in FY2011, the U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) apprehended 16,067 unaccompanied children at the Southwest border, whereas in FY2014 more than 68,500 unaccompanied children were apprehended. In FY2015, UAC apprehensions declined 42% to 39,970. At the close of FY2016 they increased to 59,692, roughly 20,000 more than in FY2015, and 9,000 less than the peak of FY2014.

The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, FY2015 (P.L. 114-4) also allowed the Secretary of Homeland Security to reprogram funds within CBP and ICE and transfer such funds into the two agencies' \"Salaries and Expenses\" accounts for the care and transportation of unaccompanied children. The act also allowed for several DHS grants awarded to states along the Southwest border to be used by recipients for costs or reimbursement of costs related to providing humanitarian relief to unaccompanied children.

As the crisis began to wane, congressional attention shifted to mechanisms to prevent such a surge from reoccurring."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appropriations", "paragraphs": ["In the Obama Administration's original FY2015 budget that was released in March 2014 for the agencies directly responsible for the UAC population (i.e., within ORR and DHS budgets), no funding increases were requested to help address the UAC surge. However, on May 30, 2014, the Office of Management and Budget updated its cost projections for addressing the growing UAC population and requested $2.28 billion for FY2015 for ORR's UAC program and $166 million for DHS for CBP overtime, contract services for care and support of UAC, and transportation costs. ", "On July 8, 2014, the Administration requested a $3.7 billion supplemental appropriation, almost all of which was directly related to addressing the UAC surge, including $433 million for CBP, $1.1 billion for ICE, $1.8 billion for HHS, $64 million for the Department of Justice (DOJ), and $300 million for the Department of State (DOS). On July 23, 2014, Senator Mikulski introduced the Emergency Supplemental Act, 2014 ( S. 2648 ) which, among other provisions, would have provided supplemental funding of $1.2 billion to HHS's Administration for Children and Families' Refugee and Entrant Assistance Program; $320.5 million and $22.1 million, respectively, for CBP and CBP's air and marine operations; and $762.8 million to ICE for transportation and enforcement and removal costs. S. 2648 would have appropriated $124.5 million to DOJ for court activities related to UAC processing, and $300 million to DOS's and the U.S. Agency for International Development's (USAID's) unaccompanied alien-related activities, the same amount the Administration requested. Congress did not pass S. 2648 .", "In December 2014, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 ( P.L. 113-235 ) provided nearly $1.6 billion for ORR's Refugee and Entrant Assistance Programs for FY2015, with the expectation that most of these funds would be directed toward the UAC program. In addition, P.L. 113-235 included a new provision allowing HHS to augment appropriations for the Refugee and Entrant Assistance account by up to 10% through transfers from other discretionary HHS funds.", "In March 2015, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2015 ( P.L. 114-4 ) provided $3.4 billion to ICE for detection, enforcement, and removal operations, including $23.7 million for the transport of unaccompanied children for CBP. The act required that DHS estimate FY2015 UAC apprehensions and the number of necessary agent or officer hours and related costs. It also provided for budgetary flexibility through the optional reprogramming of funds.", "In its FY2016 budget, the Obama Administration requested contingency funding as well as base funding for several agencies in the event of another surge of unaccompanied children. For ORR's Unaccompanied Children Program (within the Refugee and Entrant Assistance Program), the Administration requested $948 million for base funding (the same as FY2015) and $19 million for contingency funding. Congress met the base funding request but appropriated no monies for contingency funding.", "For FY2016 DHS funding, the Administration requested $203.2 million in base funding and $24.4 million in contingency funding for CBP for costs associated with the apprehension and care of unaccompanied children. The Administration requested $2.6 million in contingency funding for ICE to be used for transportation costs associated with UAC apprehensions if such apprehensions exceeded those in FY2015. Neither the Senate nor the House committee-reported FY2016 DHS appropriations bills would have funded these requests. For DOJ, the Administration requested an additional $50 million (two-year funding) for EOIR to process UAC. Congress provided CBP with $204.9 million in base funding but not the contingency funding requested. Congress provided ICE with $24.3 million in UAC transportation funding but not the contingency transportation request.", "For FY2017, within the Administration's $2.185 billion Refugee and Entrant Assistance request, the Administration requested $1,321 million for unaccompanied children that included $1,226 million in base funding and contingency funding which if triggered by larger than expected caseloads, would start at $95 million and expand to $400 million. For UAC operations within DHS, the Administration requested $13.2 million for ICE's Transportation and Removal Program, including $3 million in contingency funding; and $217.4 million for CBP, including $5.4 million in contingency funding.", "Congress, in turn, has passed two continuing resolutions (CRs) to fund ORR for FY2017. Congress first passed the Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, and the Zika Response and Preparedness Act ( P.L. 114-223 ), which funded ORR from October 1, 2016, through December 9, 2016, at the same level and under the same conditions as FY2016, less an across-the-board reduction of 0.496%. Under the terms of the CR, HHS retained its authority to augment this account by up to 10% using transfers from other HHS accounts. HHS reportedly used this authority to transfer $167 million into the account in November 2016, due to a surge in the UAC caseload.", "Prior to congressional consideration of a second CR, the Administration requested that any new CR include a provision providing a higher operating level for the Refugee and Entrant Assistance account. This stems from an increased caseload resulting from the growth in the number of unaccompanied children from Central American countries who have been apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border. The Administration requested funding for the account at an annual rate of $3.874 billion, of which $2.823 billion would be used for unaccompanied children. However, the Administration separately noted that it might be possible to meet caseload demands at a lower level than requested, indicating that at a minimum this would require $500 million for the Refugee and Entrant Assistance account, of which $430 million would be used for unaccompanied children, as well as additional transfer authority in the event of higher than anticipated costs.", "More recently, Congress passed a second FY2017 CR, the Further Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017 ( P.L. 114-254 ), which funds most federal agencies through April 28, 2017. The second FY2017 CR generally funds ORR programs at the same level and under the same conditions as in FY2016, minus an across-the-board reduction of 0.1901%. However, this CR also contains a special provision authorizing HHS to transfer additional funds into the Refugee and Entrant Assistance account to support the UAC program under certain circumstances. Specifically, the CR authorizes HHS to transfer $300 million to fund ORR programs dedicated to unaccompanied children as of February 1, 2017. After March 1, 2017, if the UAC caseload for FY2017 exceeds by 40% or more the UAC caseload for the comparable period in FY2016, the CR would appropriate an additional $200 million in new funding.

Additionally, Congress increased funding for the HHS program responsible for the care of unaccompanied children, and permitted the Secretary of DHS to transfer funds from within a specific CBP and ICE account for the care and transportation of unaccompanied children, among other actions taken. Since FY2014, the Administration has continued to request additional funding for programs geared toward unaccompanied children, and Congress has appropriated for some but not all such requests.

However, the increased number of apprehensions in FY2016 and the most recent apprehension data for the first few months of FY2017 suggest that the flow of unaccompanied children to the United States has not abated.", "Once in the United States, the number of unaccompanied children who will ultimately qualify for asylum or other forms of immigration relief that may allow them to remain in the United States remains unclear. Many unaccompanied children have family members in the United States, many of whom may not be legally present. Such circumstances raise challenging policy questions that may pit what is in the \"best interests of the child\" against what is permissible under the Immigration and Nationality Act and other relevant laws."], "subsections": []}]}}
