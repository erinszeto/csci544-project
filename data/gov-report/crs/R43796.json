Pipeline links between the new domestic oil fields and refineries are limited, so much of the crude oil moves by rail or on river barges, coastal barges, and tankers. For example, river tank barges are moving crude oil down the Illinois Waterway, Arkansas River, Ohio River, and Mississippi River to Gulf Coast refineries; the Columbia River to West Coast refineries; and the Hudson River to East Coast refineries. River barges are also moving crude oil along the Texas and Louisiana intracoastal waterway. Seagoing barges and tankers are moving oil from the Gulf Coast to refineries in the U.S. Northeast and eastern Canada, as well as through Puget Sound.

FEMA chairs a national board that administers the program consisting of representatives from the Salvation Army, Catholic Charities USA, the United Way, the American Red Cross, the Jewish Federations of North America, and the National Council of Churches. The unique part of the program is that after allocations are made at the national level, decisions on funding to specific provider organizations are made at the local level by an EFS Local Board similar in composition to the EFS National Board.

The move to HUD has been proposed by every Administration since the program was established by Congress in 1983, but Congress has never agreed to the transfer.

One-year budget authority is only available for obligation during a specific fiscal year; any unobligated funds at the end of that year are no longer available for spending.

Outlays are the funds that are actually spent during the fiscal year.

Mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, consists of budget authority and resulting outlays provided in laws other than appropriation acts and is typically not appropriated each year. However, some mandatory entitlement programs must be appropriated each year and are included in the appropriations acts. Within DHS, the Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending.", "Offsetting Collections", "Offsetting funds are collected by the federal government, either from government accounts or the public, as part of a business-type transaction such as offsets to outlays or collection of a fee. These funds are not counted as revenue. Instead, they are counted as negative outlays. DHS net discretionary budget authority, or the total funds that are appropriated by Congress each year, is composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset discretionary spending.", "Some collections offset a portion of an agency's discretionary budget authority. Other collections offset an agency's mandatory spending. These mandatory spending elements are typically entitlement programs under which individuals, businesses, or units of government that meet the requirements or qualifications established by law are entitled to receive certain payments if they establish eligibility. The DHS budget features two mandatory entitlement programs: the Secret Service and the Coast Guard retired pay accounts (pensions). Some entitlements are funded by permanent appropriations, others by annual appropriations. The Secret Service retirement pay is a permanent appropriation and as such is not annually appropriated, whereas the Coast Guard retirement pay is annually appropriated. In addition to these entitlements, the DHS budget contains offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds. These funds are not appropriated by Congress. They are available for obligation and included in the President's budget to calculate the gross budget authority.", "302(a) and 302(b) Allocations", "In general practice, the maximum budget authority for annual appropriations (including DHS) is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process. In the first stage, Congress sets overall spending totals in the annual concurrent resolution on the budget. Subsequently, these amounts are allocated among the appropriations committees, usually through the statement of managers for the conference report on the budget resolution. These amounts are known as the 302(a) allocations. They include discretionary totals available to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations for enactment in annual appropriations bills through the subcommittees responsible for the development of the bills. In the second stage of the process, the appropriations committees allocate the 302(a) discretionary funds among their subcommittees for each of the appropriations bills. These amounts are known as the 302(b) allocations. These allocations must add up to no more than the 302(a) discretionary allocation and form the basis for enforcing budget discipline, since any bill reported with a total above the ceiling is subject to a point of order. 302(b) allocations may be adjusted during the year by the Appropriations Committee by issuing a report delineating the revised suballocations as the various appropriations bills progress towards final enactment.", " Table A-1 shows DHS's initial 302(b) allocations in the House and Senate for FY2015, and comparable figures for FY2014, the President's request for FY2015, and the enacted FY2015 DHS appropriation.", "The Budget Control Act, Discretionary Spending Caps, and Adjustments ", "The FY2012 appropriations bills were the first appropriations bills that were affected by the Budget Control Act (BCA), which established discretionary security and nonsecurity spending caps for FY2012 and FY2013, and overall caps that will govern the actions of appropriations committees in both houses. Subsequent legislation, including the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, has amended those caps. For FY2015, the overall cap on discretionary spending is $1,014 billion. Separate limitations are made for defense and non-defense spending\u2014roughly $521 billion and $492 billion, respectively. Most of the budget for the Department of Homeland Security is considered non-defense spending. ", "In addition, the BCA allows for adjustments that would raise the statutory caps to cover funding for overseas contingency operations/Global War on Terror, emergency spending, and, to a limited extent, disaster relief and appropriations for continuing disability reviews and for controlling health care fraud and abuse. ", "Three of the four justifications outlined in the BCA for adjusting the caps on discretionary budget authority have played a role in DHS's appropriations process. Two of these\u2014emergency spending and overseas contingency operations/Global War on Terror\u2014are not limited.", "The third justification\u2014disaster relief\u2014is limited. Under the BCA, the allowable adjustment for disaster relief is determined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), using the following formula:", "Limit on disaster relief cap adjustment for the fiscal year = Rolling average of the disaster relief spending over the last ten fiscal years (throwing out the high and low years) + the unused amount of the potential adjustment for disaster relief from the previous fiscal year.", "For FY2014, OMB determined the allowable adjustment for disaster relief to be $12,143 million, of which only $5,717 million was exercised. In February 2015, OMB noted the FY2015 allowable adjustment for disaster assistance would be $18,430 million: $11,913 million from the rolling average and $6,517 million in carryover from FY2014. FY2015 was the first year in which there was more than $1 billion of allowable adjustment for disaster relief carried over from the previous fiscal year.", "Appendix B. DHS Appropriations in Context", "DHS Appropriations History", "As established earlier in the report, the department was first established by the Homeland Security Act, P.L. 107-296 . It became operational on January 24, 2003, in the middle of the fiscal year. Its initial partial year of operation was funded by transfers and supplemental appropriations. FY2004 was the first year the department requested and received an annual appropriations bill.", "The tables below present information on DHS discretionary appropriations, as enacted, for FY2004 through FY2014. To allow for comparisons over time, Table B-1 provides data in nominal dollars, while Table B-2 provides data in constant FY2013 dollars. Making meaningful comparisons over time for the department's appropriations as a whole is complicated by a variety of factors, the two most significant of which are the frequency of supplemental appropriations for the department, and the impact of disaster assistance funding. ", "Supplemental funding, which frequently addresses congressional priorities, such as disaster assistance and border security, varies widely from year to year and as a result distorts year-to-year comparisons of total appropriations for DHS. In the department's initial fiscal year of operations, it received over $5 billion in supplemental funding during that fiscal year in addition to all the resources transferred with the department's components. Twenty separate supplemental appropriations acts have provided appropriations to the department since it was established. Gross supplemental appropriations provided to the department in those acts exceed $115 billion. Table B-1 and Table B-2 , in their second and third columns, provide amounts of new discretionary budget authority provided to DHS from FY2004 through FY2014, and a total for each fiscal year in the fourth column.", "One of DHS's larger component budgets is that of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). That budget includes the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), which funds a large portion of the costs incurred by the federal government in the wake of disasters. Of the billions of dollars provided to the DRF each year, only a single-digit percentage of this funding goes to pay for FEMA personnel and administrative costs tied to disasters; the remainder is provided as assistance to states, communities, and individuals. The gross level of funding provided to the DRF has varied widely since the establishment of DHS depending on the occurrence and size of disasters, from less than $3 billion in FY2008 to more than $60 billion in FY2005. Table B-1 and Table B-2 , in their fifth column, provide the amount of new budget authority provided to the DRF, and in the sixth column, show the total new budget authority provided to DHS without counting the DRF.", "A visual representation of this data is available in Figure 3 ."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
