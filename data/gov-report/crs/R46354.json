Information gaps in the early weeks and other information-sharing issues include the following.", "Wuhan doctors suspected person-to-person transmission of the mysterious new pneumonia as early as late December. Dr. Zhang Jixian of the Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine later told China's state news agency that she reported a family cluster of cases to her superiors on December 27, 2019, because, \"It is unlikely that all three members of a family caught the same disease at the same time unless it is an infectious disease.\" When visitors from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan visited Wuhan January 13-14, 2020, an official from China's National Health Commission told them, \"limited human-to-human transmission cannot be excluded.\" A WHO expert echoed that position in a January 14, 2020, press conference, stating that China had experienced \"limited\" human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus, mainly in families. Chinese authorities first publicly confirmed person-to-person transmission on January 20. Wuhan medical personnel began falling ill with symptoms similar to their patients' in December, but Chinese authorities did not acknowledge medical worker infections until January 20. The best-known victim of the novel coronavirus in China is Dr. Li Wenliang of Wuhan Central Hospital, whom Wuhan police reprimanded on January 3, 2020, for sharing information about the virus online. Li was hospitalized on January 12, 2020, and died on February 7, 2020. Among other reports of medical worker infections, a single \"super-spreader\" patient who underwent surgery at the Wuhan Union Hospital on January 7, 2020, was later found to have infected 14 medical staff. Wuhan's Municipal Health Commission issued no updates while a five-day-long political meeting took place in the city January 6-10. For the duration of a second major political meeting in the city, January 12-17, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued daily updates, but reported no new infections. The commission's report on January 11, issued on the day between the two political meetings, gave the impression the epidemic was shrinking. On January 5, the commission had reported a cumulative 59 cases in the city. On January 11, it revised the cumulative number of cases down to 41, a number that remained constant through January 16. The absence of updates from January 6 to 10, and the official statements that no new cases had been detected between January 3 and January 16, may have given Wuhan residents a false sense of security that the outbreak was under control. The United States made multiple offers over the course of January 2020 to send a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) team to China to assist with response to the outbreak. Any team that went would also have learned information about the epidemic of relevance to the U.S. response. The timeline shows U.S. officials offered to send a U.S. CDC team on January 4, January 6, and January 27. On January 27, President Trump supported the offer with a tweet, saying, \"We have offered China and President Xi any help that is necessary. Our experts are extraordinary!\" No U.S. CDC team traveled to China in this period, although Weigong Zhou, an employee of U.S. CDC, and Clifford Lane, an employee of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), did participate in a WHO-China Joint Mission to China from February 16 to 24, 2020. Although Chinese experts have published a stream of papers in English-language scientific journals since the epidemic began, including several important papers in January 2020, some in the international community have expressed frustration over what China has not shared.

Chinese media reports indicate that local authorities disinfected the market on at least the two nights before it closed, potentially also compromising samples. On May 6, 2020, Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo stated, \"China is still refusing to share the information we need to keep people safe, such as viral isolates, clinical specimens, and details about the many COVID-19 patients in December 2019, not to mention 'patient zero.'\"", "It remains unclear who was responsible for decisions to withhold information in the early weeks.
