As the U.S. Congress considers housing finance reform, the experiences of these other nations may suggest some potentially useful policy approaches.", "In recent years, homeownership rates in the United States, Canada, and Australia have been similar: 66.9% in the United States, 68.4% in Canada, and 69.8% in Australia. Denmark's homeownership rate of 54.0% is low for this group of nations and for countries with developed economies.", "Of these four nations, only the United States and Denmark offer mortgages with payments that are fixed for 30 years. In Australia and Canada (and most of the world), mortgages adjust to current interest rates at intervals of one month to five years. Of the four nations, between 1991 and 2008, house prices increased the most in Australia and Denmark, but other countries including Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Norway had still greater increases. Underwriting standards have been the most flexible in the United States and less flexible in Canada and Denmark. Some homeowners in the United States would not qualify for mortgages in Canada or Denmark. The United States and Australia have programs to encourage homeownership. Canada offers limited support for home purchases, and Denmark has no homeownership programs. Nevertheless, homeownership rates are similar in the United States, Australia, and Canada. U.S. and Canadian governments directly or indirectly guarantee most mortgages and assure lenders that mortgage payments will be made in a timely manner. Australia and Denmark have no such government guarantee. In Canada, Denmark, and Australia, borrowers who default remain responsible for any unpaid balances, but it is not clear how frequently this is pursued. In the United States, the ability of lenders to seek compensation beyond a foreclosure sale depends on state law and frequently this remedy is not invoked. Capital gains from the sale of one's main home are usually tax-exempt in all four nations; all but Canada allow taxpayers to deduct mortgage interest payments.", "Only the U.S. government has a maximum size on the mortgages that it will support.

The report describes similarities and differences in a number of countries by comparing homeownership rates and changes in housing prices. It examines features of each country's primary mortgage market, which homebuyers directly experience when applying for and obtaining a mortgage; and it discusses the secondary mortgage market connections that link national mortgage markets and international financial markets. The report concludes by tentatively identifying what may explain why mortgage markets in three of the four countries examined appear to have more differences than similarities, yet have led to similar rates of homeownership.", "This report concentrates on the United States, Canada, Denmark, and Australia, occasionally mentioning other nations to provide context. Canada was selected because of its proximity to the United States, similarity of its economy to that of the United Stages, and the distinctive attributes of its housing market. Homeownership rates in Canada and the United States are similar, but Canada has stricter mortgage qualifications (i.e., underwriting standards). Both nations have experienced home price increases over the past 10 years, but Canada has had neither the price level collapse nor the increase in foreclosure rates that the United States has had. Canada funds its mortgages mainly with bank deposits, whereas the United States depends on domestic and international financial markets. The homeowner in the United States typically has a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage (FRM), whereas the Canadian homeowner has a five-year adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) that is renewed and is designed to be paid in full after 25-30 years. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Canadian home prices reached a maximum in 2007 that was 60% higher than in 1991, whereas another index developed by Teranet and the National Bank of Canada shows prices continuing to increase. U.S. home prices reached a maximum in 2006 that was 61% greater than in 1991.", "Denmark is included because it has very strict underwriting standards and has developed a type of covered mortgage bond with specific collateral to guarantee payment if the bond issuer fails. This is similar to covered bonds throughout much of the European Union (EU), including Germany. Homeowners in Denmark can prepay their mortgages by paying either the unpaid balance (as in the United States), or the market value of the mortgage. This market value will be less than the unpaid balance when interest rates have increased. Denmark and the United States are the only two nations where 30-year fixed-rate mortgages are common. Danish house prices reached a maximum in 2007 that was 150% greater than the 1991 house price level.", "Most Australian mortgages have adjustable interest rates. Australian homeowners can make extra payments on their mortgages; these prepayments can be withdrawn, sometimes by a special credit card. Between 1991 and 2009, home prices in Australia increased by 107%."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Homeownership Rates", "paragraphs": ["Broadly speaking, homeownership rates are determined by the relative costs of housing tenure options (renting versus owning) and the nonfinancial aspects of owning or renting a home. These factors can vary according to a household's income, savings, age, marital status including number of children, the tax system, anticipated house price changes, government regulations such as land use and zoning, building codes, immigrant status, and availability of desirable rental housing. Some factors including income, age, and family status can affect a person's decision to move out from their parents' home and to form an independent household. Because most homebuyers use a mortgage to finance their purchase, mortgage terms can affect homeownership rates.", "Homeownership rates vary over time and within a country. For example, in the United States, the national seasonally adjusted homeownership rate reached a peak of 69.4% in the first quarter of 2005; since then, it has trended down with occasional, slight upticks. As an example of regional variation in homeownership rates within the United States, in the second quarter of 2010, the Midwest had the highest rate (70.8%) of any census region, and the West had the lowest rate (61.4%).", "As shown in Table 1 , homeownership rates for selected developed countries in Europe, North America, Australia, and Asia range from approximately 35% to approximately 97%. The European Union (EU) reports an average homeownership rate of 66.8% with national rates ranging from a low of 43.2% in Germany to a high of 97.0% in Lithuania and Romania. Germany's relatively low homeownership rate is frequently attributed to a policy emphasis on supplying subsidies to rental housing and the integration with the former German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Outside the EU, Switzerland has long had a relatively low homeownership rate (34.6%) that is usually attributed to a high cost of ownership and strong protections for renters, including limits on rent increases. Lithuania and Romania, both EU members, had high homeownership rates following privatization initiatives after their transitions from communism in 1989 and presently lack alternative rental housing. Australia reports a homeownership rate of 69.8%, whereas Japan's homeownership rate is usually estimated around 60%.", " Figure 1 displays the homeownership rates, graphically sorted by the rate. A cautionary note: As a result of differences in the ways that countries collect and report data, international comparisons of homeownership rate statistics can be misleading. For example, in the United Kingdom, units with long-term rental contracts are considered to be owner occupied, and in Japan dwellings owned by an occupant's parents are listed as owner occupied."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "House Price Changes", "paragraphs": ["In many countries, real (inflation adjusted) house prices were relatively stable from 1991 until approximately 2000.

In this latter time period, most OECD-member countries experienced at least one year of rapid, real house price increases greater than 10%; the greatest price increase (28%) occurred in Ireland during 1998. The United States' maximum annual price increase was 8.2% (2005), Canada's was 9.8% (2006), Denmark's was 19.3% (2006), and Australia's was 16.0% (2003).

The mortgage industry term for the sum of these adjustments to the base rate represented by the riskless government bond to adjust for risks and structural differences is spread .", "In the United States, the rule of thumb is that a 30-year FRM is paid off in 7 to 10 years. As a result of the 7-to-10-year life, most mortgage calculations are based on the interest rate on a 10-year Treasury bond. For example, a decrease in the interest rate on 10-year Treasuries will lead to lower mortgage interest rates and more prepayments as borrowers refinance their mortgages to take advantage of lower interest rates.", "Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) use one of a variety of interest rates plus a mark-up or spread instead of Treasury bonds as the basis for determining the interest rate paid by the borrower. In many economic environments, lenders are willing to offer ARMs with lower interest rates than similar FRMs because the interest rate increases if the index rate or reference increases; this protects the lender against being locked into a loan that pays less than other loans. Borrowers can find ARMs attractive because of the potentially lower interest rates, the chance of future decreases in the mortgage rate, and limits (caps) on the increase in the interest rates. An ARM with a lower or \"teaser\" initial rate can be attractive to a homebuyer who plans to move before the teaser rate ends.", "Borrower risk is typically assessed in terms of credit history (perhaps summarized by the borrower's FICO [formerly Fair Isaac Company] score), and debt-to-income ratio.
