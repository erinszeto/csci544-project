Ethanol produced from corn starch accounts for 90% of the biofuels consumed, but only 5% of all light-duty motor transportation fuel consumption. Ethanol is blended with gasoline to increase octane and reduce emissions, and used as a substitute for gasoline to reduce consumption of petroleum-based fuels.", "Ethanol has the potential to provide many benefits. As an alternative to gasoline refined from imported oil, its use can improve U.S. national energy security, albeit marginally. Although the exact magnitude is subject to debate, ethanol is thought by many to produce lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared with gasoline. For this reason, its increased use is seen by many as playing a potential key role in reducing the contribution of the transportation sector to global climate change. U.S.-produced ethanol can also boost demand for U.S.-produced farm products, stimulate rural economies, and provide \"green\" jobs in rural areas.", "An ethanol-centric policy does have its critics. For example, ethanol has been implicated as a factor in rising commodity and food prices. As ethanol production increases, corn is diverted from feed and export markets and acreage is diverted from other crops, such as soybeans. The extent to which ethanol is responsible for these impacts has been the subject of debate and wide-ranging estimates. Also, the potential to displace gasoline and increase national energy security is limited by the land available to grow corn.", "Since the 1970s, ethanol has received support from the U.S. government. Presently, federal support is provided in the form of mandated levels of consumption, financial incentives such as grants and loan guarantees, tax credits, tariffs on ethanol imports, and federally funded research and development efforts. Tax credits made available to blenders of ethanol are expected to total nearly $6 billion in 2009. Incentives were initially provided to get the ethanol industry off the ground\u2014many now argue that the ethanol industry has matured and these resources should be used elsewhere.", "Federal support for biofuels and ethanol in particular is likely to be an issue facing the 111th Congress. Ethanol has received more federal support than other types of renewable energy. Some argue that the market, rather than the government, should direct investment, whether it be for ethanol, wind, solar, geothermal, or other alternatives. In addition, ethanol is used in internal-combustion engines that mostly use fossil fuels, unlike alternatives such as battery or plug-in-electric vehicles, which do not consume fossil fuels directly.", "Other issues of congressional interest may include financial support for ethanol during the recession and the extension of the blender's tax credit and the import tariff, both of which expire after 2010. The renewable fuel standard (RFS), which mandates increasing volumes of renewable fuel use through 2022, may become an issue if biofuels production shortfalls occur and the mandate cannot be met. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is drafting rules on the calculation of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions that will determine which fuels qualify for the RFS. These rules will likely attract congressional scrutiny if they exclude major stakeholders in the ethanol industry.

Ethanol and biodiesel are the most common agriculture-based biofuels. Ethanol accounted for about 92% of agriculture-based biofuels consumption in 2008, and biodiesel for 8%, on an energy-equivalent basis. Together with imports, U.S. ethanol consumption was 6.7 billion gallons in 2007 and 8.9 billion gallons in 2008.

However, since the late 1970s, U.S. policymakers at both the federal and state levels have enacted a variety of incentives, regulations, and programs to encourage the production and use of agriculture-based energy. These programs have proven critical to the economic success of rural renewable energy production. The benefits to rural economies and to the environment are not always clear and come with costs, leading to a lively debate between proponents and critics of government subsidies that underwrite agriculture-based renewable energy production.", "Proponents of government support for agriculture-based biofuels have cited national energy security, environmental benefits (such as reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to moderate climate change rates), and higher domestic demand for U.S.-produced farm products as viable justifications. In addition, proponents argue that rural, agriculture-based energy production can enhance rural incomes and employment opportunities, while expanding the value added to U.S. agricultural commodities.", "In contrast, petroleum industry critics of biofuels subsidies argue that technological advances in seismography, drilling, and extraction continue to expand the fossil-fuel resource base, which has traditionally been cheaper and more accessible than biofuels supplies. Other critics argue that current biofuels production strategies can only be economically competitive with existing fossil fuels in the absence of subsidies if significant improvements in existing technologies are made or new technologies are developed. Until such technological breakthroughs are achieved, critics contend that the subsidies distort energy market incentives and divert research funds from the development of other potential renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, or geothermal, that offer potentially cleaner, more bountiful alternatives. Still others question the rationale behind policies that promote biofuels for energy security. These critics question whether the United States could ever produce sufficient feedstock of either starches, sugars, or vegetable oils to permit biofuels production to meaningfully offset petroleum imports. Finally, there are those who argue that the focus on development of alternative energy sources undermines efforts to conserve and reduce the nations energy dependence.", "The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) is the most significant government intervention in the ethanol industry.

The blend wall occurs when the maximum allowable percentage of ethanol in conventional gasoline (e.g., gasoline meant for all vehicles) does not absorb the volume of ethanol mandated by the RFS. For instance, current annual gasoline consumption of 140 billion gallons allows for theoretical ethanol consumption of 14 billion gallons at the current maximum blend of 10% (E10). Thus 14 billion gallons is the blend wall. However, it is not practical to blend every gallon of fuel consumed in the United States at the 10% level, so the actual amount of ethanol consumed is slightly less\u2014closer to 12.5 billion gallons. The blend wall is reached when the volume of ethanol mandated under the RFS is greater than the volume which can be consumed as E10 plus the very small amount consumed as E85. Currently, the ability to consume E85 is very limited due to the lack of infrastructure and the small number of flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs)\u2014annual E85 consumption is about 10 million gallons per year, accounting for less than 1% of total ethanol consumption.", "One solution to the blend wall is to increase the proportion of ethanol in gasoline consumed by conventional vehicles. Increasing the allowable blend to E12 could raise potential consumption to 17 billion gallons without any additional investment in infrastructure or vehicle modifications. This solution is very popular with corn and ethanol producers, who claim an increase in green jobs, benefits to rural economies, and the displacement of foreign-produced petroleum. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack has supported a shift to E15. Those against increasing the blend rate, such as livestock producers and retail food interests, claim that higher food and feed prices will result from higher corn demand.

The price of a particular retail food item varies with a change in the price of an underlying input in direct relation to the relative importance (in value terms) of that input. For example, if the value of wheat in a $1.00 loaf of bread is about 10, then a 20% rise in the price of wheat translates into a 2 rise in a loaf of bread.", "Considering corns relatively small value-share in most retail food product prices, some contend that it is unlikely that the ethanol-driven corn price surge is a major factor in current food price inflation estimates. Furthermore, many economists agree that the majority of retail food price increases were not mainly ethanol-driven, but rather were the result of various other factors, including a sharp increase in energy prices that rippled through all phases of marketing and processing channels, and the strong increase in demand for agricultural products in the international marketplace from China and India (a product of their large populations and rapid economic growth)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Energy Efficiency", "paragraphs": ["An examination of energy efficiency can help determine whether ethanol provides an improvement over gasoline or other fuels. Does it take more fossil fuel to produce a gallon of ethanol than the energy available when that gallon of ethanol is consumed? The net energy balance (NEB) of a fuel is a useful means of comparing different fuels for public policy purposes. The NEB is expressed as a ratio of the energy produced from a production process relative to the energy used in that production process. An output/input ratio of 1.0 implies that energy output equals energy input. The critical factors underlying ethanol's energy efficiency include (1) corn yields per acre (higher yields for a given level of inputs improves ethanol's energy efficiency); (2) the energy efficiency of corn production, including the energy embodied in inputs such as fuels, fertilizers, pesticides, seed corn, and cultivation practices; (3) the energy efficiency of the corn-to-ethanol production process: clean burning natural gas is the primary processing fuel for most ethanol plants, but several plants (including an increasing number of new plants) use coal; and (4) the energy value of corn by-products, which act as an offset by substituting for the energy needed to produce market counterparts.", "Over the past decade, technical improvements in the production of agricultural inputs (particularly nitrogen fertilizer) and ethanol, coupled with higher corn yields per acre and stable or lower input needs, appear to have raised ethanol's NEB. About 82% of the corn used for ethanol is processed by more efficient dry milling (a grinding process) and about 18% is processed by wet milling plants. All new plants under construction or coming online are expected to dry mill corn into ethanol: thus the dry milling share will continue to rise for the foreseeable future.", "A 2007 report by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) summarized recent reports on the NEB for corn ethanol. Results varied widely, but most reports using similar assumptions found the NEB for corn ethanol to be positive. In 2004, USDA reported that, assuming best production practices and state of the art processing technology, the NEB for corn ethanol (based on 2001 data) was a positive 1.67\u2014that is, 67% more energy was returned from a gallon of ethanol than was used in its production. Other researchers have found much lower NEB values under less optimistic assumptions, leading to some dispute over corn-to-ethanol's representative NEB. A 2006 review of several major corn-to-ethanol NEB analyses found that, when co-products are properly accounted for, the corn-to-ethanol process has a positive NEB that is improving with changing technology. This result was confirmed by another comprehensive study that found an NEB of 1.25 for corn ethanol. However, these studies clearly imply that inefficient processes for producing corn (e.g., excessive reliance on chemicals and fertilizer or bad tillage practices) or for processing ethanol (e.g., coal-based processing), or extensive trucking of either the feedstock or the finished ethanol long distances to plant or consumer, can result in an NEB significantly less than 1.0. In other words, not all ethanol production processes have a positive energy balance. A few studies have concluded that corn ethanol does not have a positive NEB (that is, that it takes more fossil energy to produce a gallon of ethanol than it contains). However, these studies were distinguished by much higher energy inputs in the agriculture, transport, refining, and distribution components of the ethanol manufacturing process than other studies.

Although the use of ethanol has been touted by proponents as reducing GHG emissions compared with conventional fuels, some contend that the benefits are nonexistent or minimal. Under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA P.L. 110-140 , Section 202), GHG emissions reductions must be calculated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) using a methodology yet to be determined. Estimates for GHG reductions from ethanol vary widely depending on the methodology used. As noted above, provisions in the EISA require the reduction of lifecycle emissions including \"direct emissions and significant indirect emissions such as those from land use changes.\" For example, some studies have concluded that, if ethanol production displaces another crop that is then grown on newly cleared forest land (such as a rainforest in Brazil), the resulting GHG emissions could be substantial, and if high enough, could render the fuel ineligible under the RFS. Different methodologies will allot varying weights to these impacts and hence benefit different stakeholders. EPA is required to establish rules defining the methodology for measuring lifecycle GHG emissions under the RFS. ", "Section 202 of EISA required EPA to develop revised RFS regulations no later than one year after enactment (December 19, 2008). This deadline has passed, and a proposed rule is expected to be issued soon, followed by a comment period. These rules will likely be the subject of intense debate because they will determine whether a fuel is eligible for the RFS. Congress granted wide latitude to EPA in drafting the rules for calculating lifecycle GHG emissions. Depending on the outcome of EPA's rulemaking, Congress might revisit this issue.", "Most studies show a 10% to 20% reduction in GHG emissions for corn ethanol compared with gasoline. Estimates vary based on the system boundaries used, cultivation practices (e.g. minimum as opposed to normal tillage) used to grow the corn, and the fuel used to process the corn into ethanol (e.g., natural gas versus coal). These studies do not take into account indirect GHG emissions due to land use changes. One controversial study (based on direct and indirect lifecycle GHG emissions) comparing vehicles powered by various sources claimed more health and environmental harm from E85 ethanol-powered vehicles than from battery-electric-powered vehicles (from all alternative sources of electricity generation including coal with carbon sequestration).", "EISA requires that corn ethanol produced in facilities that commence construction after enactment (December 2007) must achieve at least a 20% reduction in lifecycle GHG emissions compared with gasoline. This provision applies to roughly 4 billion gallons of capacity out of 13.7 billion gallons of current and under-construction plants. Enough grandfathered capacity currently exists to nearly fulfill the 15 billion gallon maximum ethanol mandate that becomes effective in 2015 under the RFS. EISA also enables EPA to reduce the GHG reduction requirements if it is determined that \"generally such reduction is not commercially feasible for fuels made using a variety of feedstocks, technologies, and processes to meet the applicable reduction.\"", "Ethanol industry proponents are calling for GHG emissions to be calculated using only significant indirect factors and to exclude international land-use effects until EPA develops \"objective and peer reviewed methodology\" for their calculation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Distribution and Consumption Issues", "paragraphs": ["Distribution and absorption constraints may hinder the utilization of ethanol.

Ethanol, mostly produced in the Midwest, must be transported to more populated areas for sale. The current ethanol distribution system is dependent on rail cars, tanker trucks, and barges. Ethanol cannot be shipped in pipelines designed for gasoline because ethanol tends to separate and attract water in gasoline pipelines, causing corrosion. As a result, ethanol would need its own dedicated pipeline. This would be enormously expensive; however, some Members of Congress have introduced legislation calling for such a pipeline. Preliminary assessments of a 1,700 mile ethanol pipeline from Minnesota to New York are being conducted by a major ethanol producer and petroleum pipeline operator. Because of competition, options (especially for rail cars) are often limited. As non-corn biofuels play a larger role, some infrastructure concerns may be alleviated as production is more widely dispersed across the nation. Also, if biomass-based diesel substitutes are produced in much larger quantities, some of these infrastructure issues may be mitigated. However, ethanol would still need to be stored in unique storage tanks and blended immediately before pumping, requiring further infrastructure investments.

Once the potential volume utilized by conventional vehicles has been reached, additional increases in volume will have no market except for the very limited number of flex fuel vehicles (FFVs) that can use higher blends. Although greater use of E85 could absorb additional volume, it is limited by the lack of E85 infrastructure (limited by the considerable expense of installing or upgrading tanks and pumps) and the size of the FFV fleet.

", "To increase potential ethanol use without the infrastructure and vehicle changes required for E85, some have proposed raising the ethanol blend level for conventional vehicles from E10 to E15 or E20. For such an increase to take place, EPA must issue a waiver under Section 211(f) of the Clean Air Act, thereby allowing a higher ethanol blend. In addition, automobile and motor equipment manufacturers would have to extend warranties to include higher blends, and infrastructure such as pumps and storage tanks would have to be certified for the higher level. Most automotive manufacturer warranties are currently valid for E10 only. ", "Recently, Underwriter's Laboratories (UL) certified gasoline dispensing equipment for blends up to 15% ethanol. However, given that the actual ethanol content of E10 ranges from 7% to 13% , it is likely E15 blends will contain up to 18% percent ethanol, and would not be covered in the UL certification.", "On March 6, 2009, Growth Energy, a major organization promoting ethanol, applied to EPA (on behalf of 52 ethanol producers) for a waiver of Section 211(f)(4) of the Clean Air Act to allow an immediate increase in the maximum ethanol blend level from E10 to E12 or E13, and later allowing blends up to E15 to be used by conventional vehicles. EPA must grant or deny the waiver request within 270 days of receipt (December 1, 2009). This is significant because, even without any increase in the consumption of E85, raising the blend rate for conventional vehicles would enable an additional 7-8 billion gallons of ethanol in gasoline. This would raise the \"blend wall\" to roughly 22 billion gallons.

The Energy Tax Act of 1978 first established a partial exemption for ethanol fuel from federal fuel excise taxes. The Highway Trust Fund, funded by gasoline excise tax receipts, was reduced by the amount of the exemption so that increased ethanol use resulted in reduced funding for state transportation programs and highway projects. In addition, dealers sometimes purchased exempted gasoline and then failed to blend it with ethanol, even though they paid the reduced excise tax. In 2005, a volumetric ethanol excise tax credit, paid out of the general fund, replaced the partial tax exemption and eliminated these problems. The credit has no impact on the Highway Trust Fund and is based on the volume of ethanol in the blended fuel, reducing the opportunities for fraud.
