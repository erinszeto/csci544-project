It is estimated that each year hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals overstay their nonimmigrant visas or enter the country illegally (with fraudulent documents or bypassing immigration inspections). The most recent estimate (published in 2013) is that 11.7 million foreign nationals resided in the United States without authorization in 2012.", "DHS does not have reliable data on emigration and nonimmigrant departures from the United States. As a consequence, reliable estimates of the number of nonimmigrant overstays are not available. Over the years, the overstay estimates ranged from 31% to 57% of the unauthorized population (depending on methodology). A 2013 study of visa overstays from 2000 to 2009 estimated that total nonimmigrant overstays to the United States dropped from 705,000 per year to 190,000 per year, or about 73%, over the decade. As of June 2013, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that DHS's unmatched arrival-departure records totaled more than 1 million; however, the failure of DHS to consistently update the alien's record\u2014for example, if the authorized period of admission is extended, if deferred departure is granted, or if the immigration status changes\u2014is a major factor that prevents DHS from calculating reliable estimates of overstays."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Foreign nationals not legally residing in the United States who wish to come to the United States generally must obtain a visa to be admitted. Under current law, two departments\u2014the Department of State (DOS) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\u2014each play key roles in administering the law and policies on the admission of aliens. DOS's Bureau of Consular Affairs (Consular Affairs) is the agency responsible for issuing visas, DHS's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is charged with approving immigrant petitions, and DHS's Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is tasked with inspecting all people who enter the United States. DHS's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is the lead agency on enforcing immigration law in the interior of the United States. ", "As Congress debates comprehensive immigration reform and its component parts of immigration control (i.e., border security and interior enforcement), legal reform (i.e., temporary and permanent admissions), and the resolution of unauthorized alien residents, concerns arise over the capacity of the Department of Homeland Security to identify and remove temporary aliens who fail to depart when their visas expire. The phenomenon of foreign nationals who enter legally on a temporary basis and continue to stay after their visas expire is a fundamental problem of immigration control. This issue is not new; indeed, Congress has been grappling with options to address it over the past two decades. ", "In the early 1990s, policy makers became especially concerned about what was perceived to be a growing number of nonimmigrant overstays. At that time, nearly 2.7 million aliens had established legal status through the provisions of the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986 ( P.L. 99-603 )\u2014a law which also significantly strengthened border and interior immigration enforcement provisions. Nonetheless, demographers at the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) estimated that 3.5 million unauthorized aliens were residing in the United States in 1990. By 1996, the estimated number of unauthorized alien residents was 5.8 million, with about 2.1 million (41%) estimated to have overstayed their nonimmigrant visas. The remaining 59% were assumed to have entered the United States illegally. ", "Recent estimates indicate that the unauthorized resident alien population (commonly referred to as illegal aliens ) rose from 3.2 million in 1986 to 12.4 million in 2007, before leveling off at 11.7 million in 2012."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Elements of Nonimmigrant Visa Control", "paragraphs": ["Statutorily, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provides the elements to control the entry and exit of foreign nationals.

"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Visa Issuance", "paragraphs": ["There are two broad classes of aliens that are issued visas: immigrants and nonimmigrants. The documentary requirements for visas are stated in Section 222 of the INA. Nonimmigrants are admitted for a designated period of time and a specific purpose, and they include a wide range of visitors, including tourists, foreign students, diplomats, and temporary workers. In FY2012, the Bureau of Consular Affairs issued 8.9 million nonimmigrant visas. Combined, visitor visas issued for tourism and business comprised the largest group of nonimmigrants in FY2012, with about 7 million or 78%. Other notable categories were students and exchange visitors (10%) and employment-based nonimmigrants (6%).", "For well over a decade, the Bureau of Consular Affairs has been issuing machine-readable visas. Consular officers use the Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) to store data on visa applicants. Since February 2001, the CCD stores photographs of all visa applicants in electronic form, and more recently the CCD has begun storing ten-finger scans. In addition to indicating the outcome of any prior visa application of the alien in the CCD, the system links with other databases to flag problems that may affect the issuance of the visa. The CCD is the nexus for screening aliens for admissibility, notably screening on terrorist security and criminal grounds, and links with DHS's automated entry and exit data system, at the time the visa is issued. ", "Many foreign visitors enter the United States without visas through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), a provision of the INA that allows the visa requirements to be waived for aliens coming from countries that meet certain standards (e.g., Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, and Switzerland). In addition to the Visa Waiver Program, there are a number of exceptions to documentary requirements for a visa that have been established by law, treaty, or regulation. The INA also authorizes the Attorney General (delegated to the DHS Secretary) and the Secretary of State acting jointly to waive the documentary requirements of INA Section 212(a)(7)(B)(i), including the passport requirement, on the basis of unforeseen emergency in individual cases. In 2003, the Administration scaled back the circumstances in which the visa and passport requirements are waived.

As a result, all persons seeking admission to the United States must demonstrate to a CBP inspector that they are a foreign national with a valid visa and/or passport or that they are a U.S. citizen. In 2013, about 362 million travelers (citizens and non-citizens) entered the United States. There are 329 official ports of entry in the United States, including 15 preclearance offices in Canada, Ireland, and the Caribbean. Because many foreign nationals are permitted to enter the United States without visas, notably as discussed above through the VWP, border inspections are extremely important for those having their initial screening at the port of entry.

CBP continues to rely on I-94 Arrival/Departure forms at land ports of entry. Several years ago, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) testified that there were several weaknesses collecting the I-94 Departure Record at land ports of entry. Most notably, GAO concluded that the collection of departure forms is vulnerable to manipulation\u2014\"in other words, visitors could make it appear that they had left when they had not. To illustrate, on bridges where toll collectors accept I-94 departure forms at the Southwestern border, a person departing the United States by land could hand in someone else's I-94 form.\"", "The exit component of the automated biometric entry-exit system has long been plagued with a variety of budgetary and structural problems, particularly at land ports of exit. In December 2006, DHS officials indicated that they were considering abandonment of plans to implement the exit portion. In 2008, GAO also found weaknesses in the methodology DHS was proposing to use to verify departures of foreign nationals from the United States. GAO concluded that the plan to certify air exit system requirement would not address all potential risks of an expanded Visa Waiver Program. In that report, DHS stated that it would match foreign nationals' departure records against prior records \"to determine that the person is a foreign national, and that the person did depart the country through a U.S. airport.\" A later GAO report on the automated biometric entry-exit system concluded that \"an exit capability has yet to be fully deployed.\"", "Since 2004, DHS has tested six exit data pilot programs/demonstration projects.

This unanimous recommendation for an automated entry/exit system to monitor nonimmigrant overstays was part of a comprehensive set of proposals that SCIRP offered as part of its statutory mandate to evaluate the existing laws, policies and procedures governing the admission of immigrants and refugees to the United States.

In IIRIRA, there were several provisions aimed at nonimmigrant overstays. Foremost, IIRIRA clarified that the visa of a nonimmigrant is void as soon as the nonimmigrant alien overstays the period of authorized stay. IIRIRA furthermore created new grounds of exclusion for aliens who are unlawfully present in the United States. Those who are unlawfully present for more than 180 days but less than one year and who voluntarily depart the country are ineligible for admission or reentry to the United States for three years. An alien unlawfully present for one year or more who leaves or is removed from the United States is inadmissible for 10 years.
