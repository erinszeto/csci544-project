The rule sets limits for glider vehicles similar to those for new trucks, with some exemptions.

That is, in the decade leading up to the rulemaking, sales of glider vehicles increased by an order of magnitude\u2014from several hundred annually to several thousand or more. EPA and various commentators interpreted this change to be more than an attempt to replace damaged chassis, seeing it instead as an attempt by glider vehicle assemblers to circumvent various federal regulations. At the time, the older model year engines being used in glider vehicles were not required to meet current EPA emission standards for nitrogen oxide and particulate matter (which began in 2007 and took full effect in 2010). Under the Phase 2 rulemaking, EPA estimated that NOx and PM emissions from glider vehicles using pre-2002 engines (prior to exhaust aftertreatment requirements) could be 20-40 times higher than current engines.", "Subsequent to the Phase 2 rulemaking, EPA received petitions for reconsideration for, among other provisions, the glider requirements.

On the basis of that study and other information available to the Administrator, the Administrator may prescribe requirements to control rebuilding practices, including standards applicable to emissions from any rebuilt heavy-duty engines (whether or not the engine is past its statutory useful life), which in the Administrator's judgment cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare taking costs into account.", "Regarding its statutory authority to regulate vehicle-based GHG emissions, the Phase 2 rule defines the completed glider vehicle as a \"motor vehicle\" under CAA Sections 216(2 and 3):", "(2) The term \"motor vehicle\" means any self-propelled vehicle designed for transporting persons or property on a street or highway.", "(3) Except with respect to vehicles or engines imported or offered for importation, the term \"new motor vehicle\" means a motor vehicle the equitable or legal title to which has never been transferred to an ultimate purchaser; and the term \"new motor vehicle engine\" means an engine in a new motor vehicle or a motor vehicle engine the equitable or legal title to which has never been transferred to the ultimate purchaser.", "Thus, according to the Phase 2 rule, if a used engine is placed in a new glider vehicle, the engine is considered a \"new motor vehicle engine\" under CAA Section 216(3), because it is being used in a \"new motor vehicle.\" In short, EPA argued that \"it is reasonable to require engines placed in newly-assembled vehicles to meet the same standards as all other engines in new motor vehicles.\"", "Additionally, CAA Section 202(a)(1) not only authorizes EPA to set standards \"applicable to the emission of any air pollutant from any \u2026 new motor vehicles\" but states further that these standards are applicable whether such vehicles \"are designed as complete systems or incorporate devices to prevent or control such pollution.\" Thus, according to the Phase 2 rule, the CAA not only contemplates but in some instances directs that EPA establish standards for \"incomplete vehicles\" and vehicle components for purposes of controlling emissions from the completed vehicle. With this interpretation, EPA adopted provisions in the Phase 2 rule stating that a glider kit becomes a vehicle when \"it includes a passenger compartment attached to a frame with one or more axles.\" ", "The Phase 2 rule contains no emission standards for glider kits in isolation, but the standards for glider vehicles reflect the contribution of the glider kit. However, manufacturers of glider kits are subject to production caps as discussed above and would be required to obtain certificates of conformity before shipping any glider kits based on EPA's interpretation that the kits are considered \"incomplete motor vehicles.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impacts of the Current Glider Market17", "paragraphs": ["The production and use of glider vehicles has the potential to increase emissions of criteria pollutants\u2014specifically NO x and PM\u2014from heavy-duty vehicles. ", "Current EPA emission standards for NO x and PM (which began in 2007 and took full effect in 2010) are at least 90% lower than previous standards (see Table 1 ). Thus, EPA estimated in the Phase 2 rulemaking that NO x and PM emissions of any glider vehicles using pre-2007 engines could be 10 times higher than emissions from equivalent vehicles being produced with new engines. Additionally, based on prior standards, EPA estimated that NO x and PM emissions of any glider vehicles using pre-2002 engines (i.e., before exhaust aftertreatment requirements) could be 20-40 times higher than those of current engines. ", "These emission impacts are compounded by the recent increase in sales of glider vehicles. Estimates provided to EPA during the Phase 2 rulemaking indicate that production of glider vehicles increased by an order of magnitude since 2006\u2014from a few hundred each year to several thousands. EPA noted during the rulemaking", "While the few hundred glider vehicles produced annually in the 2004-2006 timeframe may have been produced for arguably legitimate purposes, such as salvaging powertrains from vehicles otherwise destroyed in crashes, EPA believes (as did many commenters) that the more than tenfold increase in glider kit production since the MY 2007 criteria pollutant emission standards took effect reflects an attempt to avoid these more stringent standards and (ultimately) the Clean Air Act.", "The agency's regulatory analysis of the environmental impacts of glider vehicles assumes annual sales of 10,000 for 2015 and later, which is consistent with the comments received on the Phase 2 proposed rule. The modeling also assumes that glider vehicles emit at the level equivalent to the engines meeting the MY 1998-2001 standards, since most glider vehicles currently being produced reportedly use remanufactured engines of this vintage. The analysis shows that without the new restrictions, glider vehicles on the road in 2025 could emit nearly 300,000 tons of NO x and nearly 8,000 tons of PM annually. Thus, glider vehicles could represent 5% of heavy-duty tractors on the road, and their emissions could represent about one-third of all NO x and PM from the sector. ", "Under the Phase 2 rule, EPA argued that by restricting the number of glider vehicles with high polluting engines on the road, excess NO x and PM emissions could decrease dramatically, leading to substantial public health benefits. Put into monetary terms (using PM-related benefit-per-ton values), EPA estimated that the removal of all unrestricted glider vehicle emissions from the atmosphere could yield between $6 billion and $14 billion in health benefits annually (in 2013 dollars).", "Subsequent to the rulemaking, EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) conducted dynamometric emissions tests comparing selected glider vehicles (with remanufactured engines originally certified in a MY between 1998 and 2002) to selected conventionally manufactured MY 2014 and MY 2015 tractors (with engines compliant with 2010 standards). The analysis finds that \"under highway cruise conditions, NO x emissions from the [selected] glider vehicles were approximately 43 times as high, and PM emissions were approximately 55 times as high as the [selected] conventionally manufactured 2014 and 2015 MY tractors.\" Under transient operations, NO x emissions were four to five times higher, and PM emissions were 50-450 times higher in these selected cases.", "However, the production and use of glider vehicles currently has a positive impact on fuel efficiency and GHG emissions in the U.S. fleet of heavy-duty vehicles. Several studies, including the NVFEL 2017 study, find that GHG emissions from selected glider vehicles are actually \"lower [by 10%-20%] than the conventionally manufactured vehicles when measured on the chassis dynamometer without taking into account the differences in the aerodynamic drag between the vehicles.\" These results are not unexpected given the known trade-off between NO x and GHG emissions regarding injection timing and similar engine calibration techniques. Further, many of the current aftertreatment technologies used to mitigate criteria pollutant emissions require energy to operate and thus cut into the engine's fuel efficiency. Finally, representatives of the glider assembler industry contend that glider vehicles reduce GHG and other air emissions on a \"lifecycle basis\" because of the savings created by using recycled materials, including the reuse of cast steel in the remanufacturing process. ", "Other studies report more comparable GHG emission numbers. For example, the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) estimates GHG emissions at 7%-9% lower and 4% lower using estimates with on-road operating assumptions and more recently manufactured vehicles. The UCS comments argue that recent advancement in engine design \"makes clear just how quickly any possible short-term fuel economy advantage for glider vehicles disappears.\" "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Proposed Repeal of Glider Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Following promulgation of the Phase 2 rule, EPA received from representatives of the glider vehicle assembler industry a joint petition requesting that the agency reconsider the application of the Phase 2 rule to glider vehicles, glider engines, and glider kits. The petitioners made three principal arguments. First, they argued that EPA is not authorized by CAA Section 202(a)(1) to regulate glider kits, glider vehicles, or glider engines. Second, they contended that in the Phase 2 rule EPA \"relied upon unsupported assumptions to arrive at the conclusion that immediate regulation of glider vehicles was warranted and necessary.\" Third, they asserted that reconsideration was warranted under Executive Order 13783 of March 28, 2017, \"Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth.\" ", "In addition, the petitioners took particular issue with what they characterized as EPA's assumption that the NO x and PM emissions of glider vehicles would be increased significantly. They highlighted the findings of a Tennessee Tech University (TTU) study that analyzed NO x , PM, and carbon monoxide emissions from both remanufactured and OEM engines. The results of the study show that \"remanufactured engines from model years between 2002 and 2007 performed roughly on par with OEM 'certified' engines\" and \"in some instances even out-performed the OEM engines.\" Since the proposal, TTU leaders and other stakeholders have raised questions about the accuracy of the TTU study, the role engineering experts at the university played in it, and the relationship between specific glider kit manufacturers and the university. TTU has since asked EPA to \"withhold any use or reference to said study pending the conclusion of [an] internal investigation.\"", "Finally, the petitioners argued that the Phase 2 rule had failed to consider the significant environmental benefits that glider vehicles create. They noted that glider vehicle GHG emissions are less than those of OEM vehicles due to glider vehicles' greater fuel efficiency and that the carbon footprint of glider vehicles is further reduced by the savings created by recycling materials.

The memorandum also explained that the constructed price of the glider kit vehicle subject to tax should be calculated as the price of the refurbished vehicle plus a 4% markup minus the value of used components provided by the customer. The advisory opinion was based on an interpretation that a glider kit vehicle triggers tax liability because it was effectively a \"new vehicle\" and that Congress's intent in enacting the Section 4052(f) safe harbor was to apply it only to \"repairs\" to an \"existing vehicle.\" Some industry representatives and tax planning professionals saw this as a change in previous practice that such refurbishments would not trigger excise tax liability so long as they collectively did not exceed the 75% of price threshold.

In a March 12, 2018, letter to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, Senators Tom Carper and Tom Udall\u2014Ranking Members to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and the Senate Appropriations Committee, respectively\u2014asked the agency to provide documentation on the proposed repeal and to \"immediately announce plans to withdraw the proposal.\" In March 2018, 14 Republican Members of Congress\u2014four Senators and 10 Representatives\u2014sent letters to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt asking the agency to discontinue efforts to repeal the emissions standards for glider vehicles because a repeal would undermine manufacturing industries in their home states. In a May 16, 2018, letter to DOT Secretary Elaine Chao, Representative Bill Posey asked DOT to defer to EPA's proposed repeal. In its response, DOT stated that it \"does not currently impose fuel efficiency requirements on glider kits or glider vehicles\" and did not plan to do so. At issue in EPA's Phase 2 standards for glider kits and glider vehicles\u2014and in their proposed repeal\u2014are requirements affecting criteria pollutants, not fuel efficiency. In a May 24, 2018, letter to OMB, 24 Members of Congress from both the House and the Senate \"who represent manufacturers and/or users of glider kits\" urged OMB to waive the requirement for a Regulatory Impact Analysis for the proposed repeal. In a June 21, 2018, letter, Subcommittee Chairman Greg Gianforte on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform asked EPA's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) to investigate the November 20, 2017, NVFEL study. The letter cites documents that show communications between EPA scientists and stakeholders in the trucking industry that compete with the glider vehicle assembler industry that may have impacted the \"objectivity and legitimacy\" of the study. On September 4, 2018, EPA's OIG announced plans to audit the agency's \"selection, acquisition and testing of glider vehicles at the EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory, as well as the EPA's planning for this testing.\" In a July 12, 2018, letter to EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler, Chairman Lamar Smith and other Members of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology asked EPA officials for documents pertaining to, and a briefing on, the NVFEL study, stating concerns similar to those listed in Chairman Gianforte's letter. On August 21, 2018, EPA Assistant Administrator William Wehrum responded to Chairman Smith stating that \"relevant staff \u2026 have assured me that they designed the test program, performed the testing, and wrote the test report\u2014all independent of any outside stakeholder input.\" The response stated that EPA would work with the committee to schedule a briefing on the NVFEL glider vehicle testing. In an August 29, 2018, follow-up letter to Acting Administrator Wheeler, Chairman Smith requested additional documents and information in order \"to appropriately inform the Committee on the rationale to initiate a testing program and the overall independence of the testing program.\" The House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology's Subcommittee on Oversight and Subcommittee on Environment have scheduled a hearing entitled \"Examining the Underlying Science and Impacts of Glider Truck Regulations\" on September 13, 2018."], "subsections": []}]}}
