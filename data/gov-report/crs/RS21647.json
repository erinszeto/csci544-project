The report addressed the following.", "The FCC's junk fax procedures and outcomes. The strengths and weaknesses of FCC's procedures. The FCC's junk fax management challenges.", "The GAO found that the FCC had instituted procedures for receiving and acknowledging the increasing number of junk fax complaints, but that the numbers of investigations and enforcement actions had remained mostly the same. For example, the GAO stated that in 2000, the FCC recorded about 2,200 junk fax complaints; in 2005, the FCC recorded over 46,000 complaints. However, in total, the GAO found that the FCC's Enforcement Bureau issued only 261 warnings from 2000 through 2005. Further, the GAO discovered that although the bureau had ordered six companies to pay forfeitures totaling over $6.9 million for continuing to violate the junk fax rules after receiving warnings, none of that total had been collected by the Department of Justice. The GAO also stated that FCC officials cited competing demands, resource constraints, and the rising sophistication of violators in hiding their identities as hindrances to enforcement.", "With respect to strengths and weaknesses in the FCC's procedures, the GAO determined that an emphasis on customer service, an effort to document consumers' complaints, and an attempt to target enforcement resources efficiently were strengths in FCC's procedures; however, inefficient data management, resulting in time-consuming manual data entry, data errors, and\u2014most importantly\u2014the exclusion of the majority of complaints from decisions about investigations and enforcement, continue to be weaknesses. Further, the GAO stated that the FCC does not provide consumers with adequate guidance or information to support the FCC's enforcement efforts.", "Finally, the GAO stated that FCC faces management challenges in carrying out its junk fax responsibilities. The FCC has no clearly articulated long-term or annual goals for junk fax monitoring and enforcement, and it is not analyzing the data it collects. Without analysis, the FCC cannot assess whether it needs to change its rules, procedures, or consumer guidance guidelines. Most importantly, the GAO found that without performance goals and measures and without analysis of complaint and enforcement data, it was not possible to explore the effectiveness of current enforcement measures."], "subsections": []}]}}
