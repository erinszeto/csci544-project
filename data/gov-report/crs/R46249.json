The intensity and economic importance of each of these activities, as well as their underlying market structure and production processes, vary regionally based on the agro-climatic setting, market conditions, and other factors. As a result, farm income and rural economic conditions may vary substantially across the United States. ", "Annual U.S. net farm income is the single most-watched indicator of farm sector well-being, as it captures and reflects the entirety of economic activity across the range of production processes, input expenses, and marketing conditions that have prevailed during a specific time period (see box \"Measuring Farm Profitability\" for a definition of net farm income ).

Thus, crops placed in on-farm storage are included in net farm income but not net cash income. ", "In 2018, U.S. farmers harvested a record soybean crop and the third-largest corn crop on record. That same year the U.S.-China trade dispute emerged as an impediment to trade and contributed to a widespread drop in soybean prices. However, the Administration assured producers that the trade dispute was temporary and would soon be resolved in their favor. As a result, many producers of soybeans and other crops held on to their crops in the hopes of capturing higher prices after the trade dispute was resolved. However, by mid-2019 there was no end in sight to the trade dispute, and farmer cash flows necessitated selling from on-farm inventories to meet household and farm operation needs. As a result, the net cash farm income forecast for 2019 included $14.7 billion in sales from on-farm crop inventories, whereas the 2020 forecast includes a much smaller amount ($0.5 billion) in sales from on-farm inventories.
