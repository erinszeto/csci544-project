In practice, the highway account and the transit account are discussed as though they were separate entities, with the term Highway Trust Fund being synonymous with the highway account. The Highway Trust Fund is financed from a number of sources including sales taxes on tires, trucks, buses, and trailers, as well as truck usage taxes, but approximately 90% of trust fund revenue comes from excise taxes on motor fuels. The majority of the motor fuel revenue dedicated to the trust fund is derived from an 18.3 cents per gallon tax on gasoline (24.3 cents on diesel). The highway account receives an allocation equivalent to 15.44 cents of the tax and the transit account receives the revenue generated by 2.86 cents of the tax. A separate and unrelated 0.1 cents per gallon tax on all fuels goes into the leaking underground storage tank (LUST) trust fund.", "As FY2009 comes to a close the highway account has once again needed a legislative rescue before the end of the fiscal year. Otherwise the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) would have been unable to pay states for work they had already completed in a timely manner. This situation was a rerun of last year's trust fund rescue in which $8 billion was transferred from the general fund to the highway account to carry it through the end of FY2008 ( P.L. 110-318 , enacted September 15, 2008). What differed this year was that FHWA gave Congress considerably more notice of the impending problem than was the case last year, thereby allowing Congress to take action to provide the trust fund with sufficient funds, $7 billion, to carry it through the remainder of FY2009 ( P.L. 111-46 ). For the moment the transit account remains solvent, though its long term health is also believed to be in jeopardy.", "Over the 50-plus year life of the trust fund there have been several increases in the levels of taxation. The last increase in the fuels taxes occurred in 1993 (all of these funds were not actually deposited into the trust fund initially, but were deposited in the Treasury general funds for deficit reduction purposes until FY1998). Historically, the trust fund based revenue collection system has been a reliable, and ever growing, source of funding for surface transportation. This situation has changed under SAFETEA as spending on highways and transit has exceeded both highway and transit account revenues on a regular basis. Data provided by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) spring FY2009 baseline calculation, Appendix B , Table B -1 , shows that the highway account had outlays of $35 billion for FY2007 against the aforementioned receipts of $34.3 billion. In FY2008 outlays of $37 billion were matched by only $31.3 billion in receipts, not including the aforementioned injection of $8 billion into the trust fund from Treasury general funds. For FY2009 the CBO estimates were for an even greater gap, outlays of $38.8 billion versus receipts of $31.6 billion. In reality, the FY2009 receipt level will be even worse than predicted by CBO in its spring baseline calculation because driving continues to be well below predicted levels due to the ongoing recession, and other trust fund tax components such as truck sales taxes, are also producing revenues well below expectations. These trends are shown clearly in an FHWA prepared chart attached to the end of this report in Appendix B , Figure B -1 . ", "As a rule of thumb, adding a penny to the federal fuels tax provides the trust fund with between $1.6 and $1.8 billion in new revenues. Without an increase in the existing fuel taxes, a difficult political issue in recent years, the fuel-based trust fund taxation system will not be able to support increased surface transportation spending. The choice for policymakers, therefore, is to find new sources of income for the expanded program that transportation proponents desire, or alternatively, to settle for a smaller program that might look very different than the one currently in place. ", "In the past nothing has solved the political problems of the surface transportation program faster than new money. TEA21 especially benefitted from a run up in fuel usage during the boom years of the late 1990s, that was at least partially the result of growing SUV purchases during the period. SAFETEA did not have quite the same financial backing, but the authors of the act were nonetheless able to find sufficient new revenues to make the act possible. The next reauthorization bill, as the above discussion indicates, lacks a ready source of new cash. This situation will define the upcoming legislative debate much more clearly than discussions of program structure, system needs, and a host of other items expected to be addressed in the weeks and months ahead."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA; P.L. 111-5)", "paragraphs": ["The ARRA provided considerable new funding authority to surface transportation programs for FY2009 and FY2010.

High Speed Passenger Rail, previously a relatively small federal program, will receive $8 billion. An additional $1.5 billion which can be used for any eligible surface transportation purpose is made available by a new Surface Transportation Discretionary Grant program. This new program is under the control of the Secretary of Transportation and must be spent on projects of at least $20 million and not more than $300 million. The ARRA also provides for changes in tax law that will enable additional spending on transportation projects using so-called innovative financing (in this case providing a tax credit for \"Build America Bonds\" amongst other provisions). Transportation activities normally outside the scope of surface transportation reauthorization also received funding.", "The reauthorization debate will proceed against this backdrop. Those seeking to delay reauthorization view this large boost in funding as a reason to move slowly on a new surface transportation bill.

Discretionary programs tend to be smaller programs. Funding under these programs is allocated by the FHWA or is earmarked by Congress.", "The Highway Program is primarily a state run program.

The state DOTs let the contracts and oversee the project development and construction process. ", "Federal monies for highway project spending are not provided to states up front. Rather, when amounts are \"distributed\" to the states, it is initially a notification of the availability of federal funds. Once a project is approved and the work is started, the states may submit vouchers to the FHWA for reimbursement for the project's costs as, or after, they are incurred. The \"reimbursable\" nature of the highway program is designed to help prevent waste, fraud and abuse.", "The Highway Program is funded with contract authority (CA). CA is a type of budget authority that is available for \"obligation\" (which makes the federal government obligated to pay) according to the provisions of authorizing legislation, without further legislative action (i.e., prior to an appropriation). Because CA can be obligated without an appropriation, a spending control mechanism, called a \"limitation on obligations\" (ObLim or Oblimit), is used to control annual spending in the place of the appropriation. The ObLim sets a limit on the total amount of contract authority that can be obligated in a single fiscal year. In most discussions, the ObLim is analogous to an appropriation, in that it is considered to be the best indicator of the amount of federal funding actually being made available for use by the states. ", "Federally funded highway projects generally require states and/or local governments to participate financially by providing a designated local matching share. For most Interstate System projects the match is 90% federal and 10% state/local (except in states with large amounts of federal land where the federal share may be larger). For other programs the match is generally 80% federal and 20% state/local.

These programs were conceived, at least in part, to provide federal funds for specific needs as is indicated generally by the program names. There are also a number of smaller formula programs and activities such as the Safe Routes to School program, Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) program, and Metropolitan Planning. Over time, the state DOTs have been given increasing flexibility to shift funds from one program to another (excepting HSIP) to help implement their state transportation plans. Some Highway Program funding may also be used for transit projects. This flexibility has the effect of reducing the importance of funding formulas and program eligibility distinctions. Despite the growing funding flexibility, some state DOTs as well as some urban interests would argue that the programmatic structure still inhibits them from using federal highway funds in the way that they deem the most efficient or beneficial. The Equity Bonus Program is the largest highway program in dollar terms. Its purpose is to assure that each state receives a prescribed rate-of-return (currently 92%) to its core apportionment programs on its highway users' tax payments into the highway account of the trust fund. The program's operation is very complicated and cannot be described here for reasons of brevity. One effect of the Equity Bonus, however, is that, like the flexibility provisions, it can be viewed as diluting the policy rationales associated with the core program formulas.

Funding in two of these programs, the Urbanized Area Formula Program and the Fixed Guideway (or Rail) Modernization Program, is distributed by formula. The Urbanized Area Formula Program, which accounts for 41% of authorized funding in SAFETEA, provides funding to urbanized areas with a population of 50,000 or more.

From their perspective this legislation presents a clear break from the existing structure of the federal surface transportation program that has developed incrementally over the last several decades. In part they hold this view because they see the proposed legislation as a refocusing and simplification of the program. Simplification here is facilitated by the elimination of 75 stand alone programs, the creation of a few new focused programs, and a rethinking of existing programs that are retained. This restructuring is especially true for what might be regarded as the traditional highway portion of the legislation (Title I\u2013Federal-Aid Highways) although, as will be discussed, the bill to a significant extent tries to make Title I more intermodal in nature, and therefore might not be viewed by its authors as having a purely highway section. ", "The legislation is not devoid of new initiatives. It creates several new programs: the critical asset investment (CAI) program, the freight transportation program (FIP), the metropolitan mobility and access program (MMA), and a program for projects of national significance (PNS). The bill also provides for structural and other changes in several retained programs. ", "A principal feature of the legislation is its focus on intermodalism, which its authors consider an issue of overarching importance throughout the bill. To advance its policy goals the bill makes significant changes to the organization of the Department of Transportation (DOT), requires new national and regional (metropolitan) planning initiatives, greatly enhances the role of certain groups within the transportation planning and construction process - most notably in regard to Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) - and establishes broad program performance management systems.", "The interest in performance management is particularly notable. The terms \"performance target\" and \"performance measure\" appear a combined 95 times in the bill. These same terms appeared only eight times in SAFETEA. According to the preamble, the legislation is designed \"to transform Federal surface transportation to a performance-based framework ... \" While federal performance management systems requirements would be new, the extent to which this is transformational is debatable. This bill appears to add performance management on top of the existing rules, regulations, and reporting requirements within many of the categorical programs. Some would argue that to be transformational, performance-based management should be used to replace rather than supplement these requirements. In this way the federal government would not dictate to states, localities, and transit agencies how to spend federal funds, funds that might be distributed via a block grant, but would set performance standards that they must meet. Recipients of federal funds would then be free to develop their own solutions to transportation problems, but would be held accountable, through rewards and penalties, for the results. ", "At 775 pages, without funding data, details on several programs, and an expected list of high priority projects (earmarks), the bill is nonetheless likely to be viewed as complicated and difficult to comprehend, especially for non-transportation practitioners. In part, the length of the bill is related to how it has been drafted. Whereas previous legislation usually contained language amending the U.S.C. Title 23 (Highways), this legislation redrafts significant portions of the title. But the length of the proposed legislation is also related to the aforementioned restructuring of the federal surface transportation programs and by significant changes in the overall policy goals advanced by the bill. ", "Because STAA includes some limits on new highway lane construction and focuses on freight, transit, intermodalism, and livability policies, some observers might construe features of this bill as being biased against expanding highway capacity. Others, however, may view these features of the bill as reflecting policies that favor alternatives to the automobile, such as transit, bicycles, and walking.", "Funding remains the great unknown of this legislation. The T&I Committee in its supporting document calls for a $500 billion program; $450 billion, mostly from the Highway Trust Fund's two accounts, for surface transportation programs (with a U.S. Treasury general fund contribution for transit) and an additional $50 billion for high speed rail, most likely from the U.S. Treasury general fund account and/or other sources. Since the T&I Committee lacks jurisdiction over tax and other fundraising policy, it must wait for the House Committee on Ways and Means to come up with a revenue raising scheme that would fund the T&I Committee's proposals or limit the size of the bill to some other, as of yet, undetermined amount. ", "Because the bill lacks a revenue title as well as programmatic funding information, it is, at this juncture, difficult to evaluate the relative importance that the STAA places on certain of its programs, especially its new ones. For example, it is clear that the FIP is an important policy direction for the bill, but without funding information, it is impossible to know whether it is viewed as a small start up program or a large long term initiative. ", "In the supporting documents provided by the Committee transit appears to do well in terms of funding under the bill. T&I has stated that the federal transit program alone will be authorized at $99.8 billion over six years, an annual average of $16.6 billion.

From a policy perspective the limitation on tolling of the Interstate System is important because it is the Interstate System highways that most often carry sufficient traffic to potentially produce the level of toll revenue needed to support toll-based financing of highways. SAFETEA provided for a limited broadening of tolling of Interstate System highways, by adding a number of pilot programs and making a number of other modifications. STAA appears to be changing direction by eliminating several programs and instituting some new requirements. To begin with, STAA would eliminate the following toll or toll related programs: the Interstate System Construction Toll Pilot Program, the Interstate System Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Pilot Program, the Value Pricing Program, and the Express Lanes Demonstration Program.", "Perhaps more importantly, STAA would require that before instituting tolls a number of new conditions are met. A public authority would have to consider the negative effects of a toll on interstate commerce or travel, provide improvements to accommodate diverted travelers, and mitigate the effect of the toll on low-income drivers. Toll revenues are first to be used for facility capital and operating costs, for debt service, and for a reasonable return on investment. Excess revenues generated from a tolled high occupancy vehicle (HOV) facility may be used for public transportation facilities within the same travel corridor as the HOV lanes. This could potentially be a significant shift of resources from highways to mass transit in certain corridors. DOT is to review all toll rate schedules prior to implementation. Federal participation would be allowed in HOV projects where hybrids or other low-emission single-occupant vehicles pay a toll to use the HOV lanes.", "Public-private partnerships (PPP), often financed by vehicle tolls, have been created in many different ways to develop, construct, and operate highway and transit infrastructure. Under the proposed legislation, PPPs entered into by agreements at the state and local level, but involving federal-aid highway funds, would also be subject to a number of new federal requirements. Among the most important provisions is the requirement that a public authority entering into such an agreement must evaluate the costs and benefits of the PPP against traditional public delivery methods. The public authority would also be subject to some new requirements regarding public information and public involvement before awarding a contract. Furthermore, PPP agreements would be precluded from including a non-compete clause. These clauses are designed to prevent public authorities from providing new, competitive highway infrastructure near a privately controlled facility. The act also permits the public authority to terminate a contract early with fair market compensation to the private partner (Section 1504). ", "To ensure compliance with these new tolling and PPP requirements, the act creates within the FHWA an Office of Public Benefit (OPB) to \"provide for the protection of the public interest in relation to highway toll projects and public-private partnership agreements on Federal-aid highways\" (Section 1204). Among other things, the director of the office is empowered to administer toll agreements by reviewing and approving toll rate schedules and changes. The OPB would also be required to provide leadership and technical assistance on the development of highway toll projects and highway PPPs.", "These new tolling and PPP oversight provisions appear to be designed to mitigate problems that detractors of these arrangements often mention, such as the possibilities for diverting traffic to other routes and travelers to other types of transportation, increasing driving costs to burdensome levels (particularly for low income travelers), and by-passing the public planning process. This may also be an attempt to develop a more systematic approach to identifying and evaluating the public interest in PPPs, as suggested by GAO among others, instead of the current project-by-project evaluation. Critics of more oversight worry, however, that these new requirements will dampen, if not extinguish, the desire of states and the private sector to pursue tolling and PPP agreements because of the extra time, expense, and uncertainties that they may entail. A possible major source of uncertainty is the requirement that the OPB review and approve a PPP on its compliance with new public transparency requirements. One critic suggests this review and approval might be forthcoming only late in the process when design and financing details have been settled.

This would be a major change in the way the Federal-Aid Highway Program operates and could be seen as a major shift in authority from the states to the MPOs.

From a flow of funds perspective some might also question why Subtitle B of Section I of STAA, which includes MMA and PNR, is not funded from both the highway and transit accounts of the Highway Trust Fund rather than solely from the highway account.", "At this time STAA has no earmarks included, although a place is held for High Priority Projects. During the SAFETEA reauthorization process, funds for the Projects of National and Regional Significance were to have been distributed as competitive grants. Instead, as enacted, all of the funds associated with this program were earmarked.

The formula programs could also be subject to discretionary set asides that could be subject to earmarking later in the legislative process.", "STAA, as of this writing, has no equity adjustment program, but a place is held in the bill at Section 1104. However, because the bill includes programs to improve freight bottlenecks, to fund nationally significant megaprojects, and to encourage, mostly urban, intermodalism, the spending of Federal-Aid highway funds across the nation is likely to be uneven. This could both exacerbate the donor-donee conflict and make any attempt to bring donor states up to a targeted share of spending more expensive. Determining which programs would be kept within the auspices (often referred to as scope) of an equity adjustment could also be a problematic decision. If the MMA, PNS, High Priority Projects and perhaps FIP are kept within the scope, the states that benefit the most from these programs could have their core programs reduced via a lower equity adjustment. If these large programs were left out of the scope, the percent of the overall bill that would be brought up to a guaranteed rate-of-return would be reduced. In addition, the expanded transferability of funds between highway and transit programs could skew the conceptual framework of the rate-of-return rationale as highway account funds are used for transit purposes. ", "Although STAA proposes numerous programmatic changes in the Federal-Aid Highways title (Title I) of the bill, as of this writing, authorization levels are not included. This limits analysis of the policy impact of the changes in the bill. For example, without knowing the funding levels of the new Critical Asset Investment Program (CAI) and Freight Improvement Program (FIP) relative to the Surface Transportation Program it is difficult to determine the relative importance of national needs supported by CAI and FIP versus an expanded STP.

Most of the funding authorized by SAFETEA is provided to the states through the regular Highway Programs, such as the STP, that provide significant benefits to the freight industry. Of the total funding only relatively small amounts were specifically dedicated to freight transportation improvements, leaving most decisions about the types of infrastructure improvements to fund largely to state DOTs and MPOs. Because of this, some in the transportation community would like to see a larger and more well-defined federal freight program that addresses needs the regular programs have not or cannot address.", "Section 1105 of the STAA creates a new program, the Freight Improvement Program (FIP), that would direct funds to publicly owned highway freight transportation projects that provide community and highway benefits by addressing economic, congestion, security, and safety issues associated with freight transportation. Eligible projects must be on the existing National Highway System (NHS) or National Network (NN), or on a newly designated secondary freight route. These secondary freight routes would be selected by each state, in consultation with local governments, as being of substantial economic or freight-related significance, such as serving the mining, agricultural, timber, or tourism industries. DOT would review the state's list and then designate them as such. Each state would be required to measure and document the speed, reliability, and accessibility of freight movement along facilities that receive funding on the NHS or NN but not on the designated secondary freight routes. DOT would also establish performance targets against which to measure each state's progress toward improving freight movement. Every five years each state would be required to assess the condition of its secondary freight routes.

However, without a specific authorized amount to indicate the program's share of total funding, it is impossible to assess the FIP's real significance. The establishment of freight advisory committees and funding for multi-state corridor coalitions builds on freight-related planning provisions enacted in SAFETEA and predecessor legislation. Some state DOTs and MPOs already have created freight advisory committees and multistate corridor coalitions have been established for a handful of interstate routes. The FIP attempts to address stakeholder concerns regarding accountability for funding decisions by requiring performance tracking of freight routes, but it does so at the state DOT level.

Implementing some of the guidance in the bill is likely to be difficult, however.

Similarly, it could be difficult to measure the potential impact of tolling on transit service as called for in the bill.", "As proposed, the Office will apparently be a party to all alternative/innovative financing agreements dependant on toll revenues. Many in the transportation community hold the view that PPPs need to be a significant part of the Nation's highway infrastructure creation process going forward. A long standing concern expressed by many of these same observers is that PPPs are already difficult to execute from an administrative perspective. It is likely that supporters of increased tolling and the use of PPPs for infrastructure creation will be, to say the least, wary of this new Office, which they will likely view as another difficult bureaucratic hurdle to be crossed.

At the national level, the proposed legislation creates a new requirement for the development of a National Transportation Strategic Plan by the Secretary of Transportation, a national equivalent to the statewide long-range transportation plan required under current law (Section 1207). The national plan is to be developed primarily from projects with significant national and regional benefits submitted by states. Funding for a project from the Projects of National Significance program will depend to some extent on inclusion in the strategic plan. Once created the plan is to be updated every two years. The creation and updating of the plan is to be the responsibility of the new Office of Intermodalism to be established in the Office of the Secretary.", "Many have called for the creation of a national transportation plan to guide the use of federal transportation funds. The National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission, for one, recommended the creation of a national strategic plan, although it believed the plan should be overseen by an independent commission and should include recommendations on how investment programs should be funded. By contrast, the STAA proposes to have DOT oversee the development of the plan, and the plan will not necessarily be constrained by available resources nor include funding recommendations. As currently written, the legislation is likely to require a significant amount of work for DOT, particularly in evaluating the proposals for inclusion in the plan. With an expectation that inclusion in the plan might help in securing federal funds, states may deluge DOT with what they consider worthy projects. Whether this is the case or not, the requirement that DOT must evaluate each project submitted within 60 days may be difficult. DOT is also required to disseminate data and 20-year projections to states on a range of topics for use in preparing transportation plans and projects, including a 20-year projection of passenger demand for suborbital space tourism. While states may have many project proposals already on the books through the statewide and metropolitan transportation planning processes, the requirements for inclusion in the national plan might also create substantial work for state DOTs. Another problem might arise when states try to identify projects involving infrastructure that is largely owned and operated by private companies, such as freight rail. If the DOT only puts together a list of projects from what states send in, some critics might wonder how \"strategic\" the ultimate plan is likely to be. On the other hand, DOT may face a barrage of criticism if, in the course of setting priorities, some states are significantly underrepresented and others overrepresented.", "The act proposes to alter state transportation planning in several ways. To begin with, the proposed bill makes a number of changes to the existing statewide planning requirements (Section 1509). Among other things, the act adds some factors that may be considered in the planning process such as enhancing sustainability and livability, reducing GHG emissions and dependence on foreign oil, and improving public health. In accordance with the Clean Air Act, the proposed legislation requires, as part of the planning process, each state to \"develop surface transportation-related greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, as well as strategies to meet such targets.\" In places with congested airports and freight rail corridors, the plan is specifically required to include measures to alleviate the congestion. The plan must also take into consideration deep draft ports, inland waterways, and interconnectivity between modes. In the statewide transportation improvement program, the state is required to implement a system of performance management that includes the development of performance measures and targets. ", "The proposed legislation also adds a freight improvement program that includes a requirement for each state to develop a state freight plan that \"provides a comprehensive overview of the State's current and long-range freight planning activities and investments\"(Section 1105). This freight plan may be either separate from or incorporated within the statewide plan. The state freight plan is required to include performance measures and targets related to freight movement, and to describe how the state plans to achieve those targets. Section 1105 also authorizes the Secretary to designate and make grants to a maximum of 10 freight corridor coalitions. A designated corridor coalition is required to develop a freight corridor plan that is modeled on the statewide strategic long-range plan. The plan is required to be consistent with the long-range statewide transportation plan, the statewide improvement plan, the metropolitan plan and improvement program, and the metropolitan mobility plan under Section 701 of the bill.", "Many of the changes made to statewide planning requirements are also made to the requirement for metropolitan planning, as, for example, with the setting of GHG emissions targets and strategies (Section 1508). If enacted, MPOs will also be required to implement a system of performance measurement. There are four notable provisions that apply only to MPOs. First, the act raises the urbanized area population threshold for MPO creation from 50,000 to 100,000, although existing MPOs in areas currently between 50,000 and 100,000 must be maintained as required by current law. Second, the act requires that voting members of the MPO are represented in proportion to the population of each political subdivision to the total population in the metropolitan planning area. This represents a major change, as voting structures currently vary widely according to state and local law and custom. Third, the act adds to the certification requirements both the new voting structure requirement and a requirement that the MPO is meeting or likely to meet its performance measurement targets. As part of the certification process, the Secretary may withhold up to 20% of funds attributable to the metropolitan planning area. Fourth, the act requires the creation of a database of MPO characteristics.", "As noted earlier in creating the Metropolitan Mobility and Access Program (Section 1205), the act provides funding directly to MPOs in areas of 500,000 or more. Additionally, this new program requires the development of a metropolitan mobility plan \"that identifies projects that the eligible recipient, or another entity described in and subject to the plan, proposes to address surface transportation congestion and its impacts within the urbanized area served by the eligible recipient.\" According to the proposed legislation, this plan needs to be coordinated with state and transit agencies and is to be reviewed and approved by DOT.", "Finally, the act defines a rural planning organization (RPO) as \"an organization designated by a State to enhance the planning, coordination, and implementation of statewide transportation plans and programs in areas with a population of less than 50,000 individuals, with an emphasis on addressing the needs of such areas of the State.\" The act requires a state to coordinate statewide planning with such organizations if designated, and to consult with a RPO in the obligation of transportation enhancement funds in its planning area."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Performance Management", "paragraphs": ["The bill includes performance management as a new requirement in many programs throughout the federal surface transportation program, including, among others, the Freight Improvement Program (FIP), the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP), the Critical Asset Improvement (CAI) Program, the Metropolitan Mobility and Access Program (MMAP), and statewide and metropolitan planning. The overall approach is to add performance management to focus attention on the most important objectives of a program, and to improve the transparency to program managers and the general public as to whether the objectives are being met or not. The requirements for performance management and the consequences for not meeting the requirements vary from program to program. In some cases, there are no explicit sanctions for not establishing performance management tools, nor for not meeting the performance goals that are established. For example, in the FIP a state is required to establish performance goals and performance measures, must include in its state freight plan how these goals will be met, and must report this information to the Secretary annually. But funds from the FIP do not appear to be dependent on the quality of the plan nor progress toward the goals, and there appear to be no other consequences for not following through.", "In other programs, however, there are sanctions for not establishing performance goals and for not meeting the goals themselves.

The draft bill requires DOT to establish quantifiable safety performance targets for each state and to report to Congress annually on each state's progress in meeting its performance targets.

The proposed average annual authorization under the STAA, therefore, would appear to be $16.6 billion. Ignoring highway program funds that allegedly may go to support transit projects and the $50 billion that is proposed for high speed rail, the share of the funding that is directed to transit by the STAA could be 22% ($99.8 billion of $450 billion).

To begin with, the bill appears to provide blanket permission to transfer (or \"flex\" as it is sometimes referred to) highway program funds to transit programs and vice-versa (Section 1103). Funding from three current highway programs\u2014NHS, STP, and CMAQ\u2014can be used to directly support transit projects. In addition, funds from NHS, IM, and the Bridge Program can be transferred to STP and then used to fund transit. Some transit funds are available for highway uses, but generally the flexibility provisions have been used to transfer highway funds to support transit projects. In the period from FY2004 through FY2007 an average of about $1 billion of highway funds per year were flexed to transit. The blanket provision in STAA might make it easier and more likely that such funds will be flexed.

First, the proposed legislation appears to abolish the discretionary, but heavily earmarked, Bus and Bus-Related Facilities Capital Program, with the program's funds and functions absorbed into the existing Urban and Rural Formula Programs (Sections 3006 and 3010) and a new discretionary Intermodal and Energy Efficient Transit Facilities Program (Section 3007) that replaces the existing Clean Fuels Grant Program. This new Intermodal and Energy Efficient Transit Facilities Program makes funding available to build, replace, or rehabilitate facilities that are intermodal, in that they connect public transportation to another transportation mode, or will reduce energy and greenhouse gas emissions.", "Making Bus Capital Program funds distribution partly formula and partly discretionary appears to be something of a compromise between those that argue for making the funds entirely formula driven and those that argue for keeping them discretionary. Some argue that distributing the funds by formula would be more equitable, would simplify the process and eliminate the vagaries of earmarking, and would make funding more reliable from year to year so that transit agencies can develop long term investment plans. Those in favor of discretionary spending argue that the Bus Program provides an important way for transit agencies to make expensive periodic bus purchases and facility investments that cannot be met with formula funds, and that earmarking provides an important way for Congress to control this funding stream.", "The second major change is the creation of a new Metropolitan Mobility and Access (MMA) program (Section 1205). Although this new program is in Title I of the bill, the highway title, this new program may provide a major new funding source for transit provision in large urban areas, those with more than 500,000 residents. The MMA is similar to a recommendation of the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission for a highway congestion relief program, although the commission recommended such a program for metropolitan areas with a population of one million or more. Funding from this program in STAA would be distributed by formula according to population and highway traffic congestion. Funds would be available to fund improvements on a mode-neutral basis. As was mentioned earlier, in the creation of this new program a major change is being proposed in the relationship between federal, state, and local government in the federal-aid highway program. In the MMA program, as currently conceived, federal highway funds, for the first time, would be provided directly to metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) instead of to and through state DOTs.", "The third major change is the creation of the Coordinated Access and Mobility Grants Program (Section 3009) that is created by combining the existing Elderly and Disabilities Program, the JARC Program, and the New Freedom Program. There has been criticism that as separately constituted funding streams, these programs have inhibited the coordinated development of human-services transit service and are administratively burdensome. Funding in the new program will be distributed by formula based on the number of people who are elderly, disabled, low-income, or welfare recipients. Under the program, recipients will be required to develop a performance plan with performance measures that at a minimum \"ensure that transit systems and operations are fully compliant with the regulations established under Title 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations for Americans with disabilities.\" Flexibility for funding projects under the program is constrained if a recipient fails to meet the goals set forth in its performance plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transit Program Changes", "paragraphs": ["In addition to structural changes in the federal transit program, there are also important changes proposed within some of the major existing programs. Within the Urbanized Area Formula Program (Section 3006) a major change proposed by the bill is to allow transit operators in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more to use some funds for operating costs. Currently, only transit agencies in urbanized areas of 200,000 or less are permitted to use funds for operating purposes, although SAFETEA changed the definition of a capital expense to include some things that are traditionally considered operating expenses. The change in the proposed legislation would permit agencies in areas between 200,000 and 500,000 to use 20% of their federal funds for operating expenses; agencies in areas of between 500,000 and 1 million to use 10%; and areas over 1 million to use 5%. A requirement for the use of federal funds to cover operating expenses is that the transit agency must have a dedicated source of state or local government revenue for its operating costs or the non-federal share of operating costs (excluding system-generated revenues) must be greater than during the previous year. Current federal matching shares are left unchanged in the STAA, with capital expenses generally having a maximum federal share of 80%, and operating expenses having a maximum federal share of 50%.", "The use of federal funds for operating expenses has been controversial since the beginning of the federal transit program in the 1960s. Support for using federal funds in this way tends to rise when transit service is threatened by such things as high fuel prices, inflationary pressures, and fiscal problems at the state and local level. Opponents contend that while federal operating support has probably maintained a higher level of transit service than would have prevailed without it, such support causes productivity to decline (the amount of transit output relative to inputs). This is because government support, particularly from the federal government, allows transit operators to de-emphasize the need to control costs and generate revenues.", "Details on how the Rural Formula Program would be modified are largely missing from the draft legislation. However, in the T&I Committee's bill summaries, it states that the formula for distributing funds will be altered to include transit service provided and consumed, factors that are not currently considered. It also states that the legislation will increase the funding directed to small urban and rural transit service, although it is unclear from this whether the increase is in terms of the dollar amount or share of overall transit program funding. With most transit funding going to large urban areas, there has been a push by advocates of small cities and rural areas for more transit funding over the last few authorization cycles. Incorporating transit service factors in the funding formula would be a way to reward transit providers for their effort to provide service in places where it tends to be very costly to do so.", "Another major programmatic change proposed by the act is the simplification of New Starts/Small Starts project development and funding approval (Section 3008), a rigorous but time-consuming process that has been the subject of a lot of criticism. The current New Starts process requires an application to FTA for approval at three different stages of project development: entry into preliminary engineering, entry into final design, and approval of a Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA). The legislation proposes to reduce this to one step, the approval of a FFGA. Project sponsors must also have FTA approve the project for entry into project development, but this is assured if the project has been chosen as the locally preferred alternative as required under the metropolitan transportation planning process.", "The bill also does away with the alternatives analysis required under the New Starts program that was often seen as a duplication of the alternatives analysis required under the National Environment Policy Act (NEPA). To expedite projects, the act would also allow the Secretary the ability to fast track some projects, and would base FTA's evaluation partly on the amount of federal assistance being sought by the applicant. Finally, as mentioned earlier, the act would create an Office of Expedited Project Delivery within the FTA to speed capital projects, particularly New Starts/Small Starts projects. The Office would be expected to monitor project progress, promote best practices, help with coordination, use conflict resolution techniques, and coordinate with the Office of Expedited Delivery in FHWA.", "Advocates of simplifying the New Starts process argue that it will significantly shorten project delivery times. According to some, quick approval of federal funding is particularly appropriate where the risks are low, such as when the federal funding amount/share are relatively low, and where project benefits are likely to be high relative to costs. Critics worry that such changes may damage the rigor of the evaluation process, ultimately leading to federal support of less competitive projects. Simplifying the process by creating a low hurdle for entry into the New Starts pipeline also creates the possibility that FTA may receive a large number of projects that it has to manage through the evaluation process to ultimate denial. Another possibility is that FTA will approve or intend to approve many more projects for funding than can be supported by the available commitment authority. This may mean relatively quick funding approval for projects that then languish while waiting in line for more commitment authority to be made available by Congress.", "The STAA would also make a number of other changes to the New Starts/Small Starts program. The bill would alter the definition of a New Starts project to one which receives federal assistance of $100 million or more, up from the current $75 million; a Small Starts project would be defined as a project in which federal assistance is less than $100 million. Additionally, the bill attempts to clarify the way in which the evaluation factors are used by FTA to decide among projects. Many have criticized FTA for relying too heavily on the cost-effectiveness index that measures the time savings to transit system users. The bill therefore states that FTA must take into account a range of factors: mobility and accessibility, congestion relief, energy and environment, economic development, and supportive land uses and future patterns of land use. Furthermore, the legislation prohibits FTA from using a cost-effectiveness index, and only permits using a transportation system user benefit calculation to evaluate mobility.", "The STAA may make some major changes to the way in which funding under the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program is distributed, although details of how this would work are missing from the committee print. In summary material, T&I says that the complicated 7-tier formula for distributing funds will be simplified. Funding instead will be distributed by a formula \"using readily available transit data that most closely aligns with maintenance needs.\" The summary also states that there will be no prohibition to funding going to fixed guideway systems in urbanized areas of 200,000 or less. There may also be a performance plan component, whereby recipients are required to develop performance goals related to bringing and keeping transit assets in a state of good repair.", "Performance planning, goal setting, and measurement is a pervasive theme throughout. Performance plans are required generally as part of the metropolitan transportation and statewide planning processes, and specifically as part of the Urbanized Area Formula Program, the Rural Formula Program, and the Coordinated Access and Mobility Grants Program. As noted above, performance planning may also be required as part of the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program. In the case of the Urbanized Area Formula Program, for example, to be able to receive federal funds, designated recipients will have to develop performance goals as part of a performance plan and have that plan accepted by FTA. Updates to the plans will be required periodically, and acceptance of an updated plan will rest to some extent on whether the recipient has made sufficient progress toward its goals. In other words, the legislation proposes to cut off federal funding to a recipient if it does not meet its performance goals. It almost goes without saying that this would be highly controversial. The legislation, therefore, provides FTA with the authority to reduce the performance targets, if appropriate, to keep federal funding flowing to a transit funding recipient.

This level of funding for high-speed rail is a substantial increase over the $100 million per year authorized in SAFETEA (section 9001) and the $300 million per year authorized in the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act ( P.L. 110-432 , section 501) enacted in October 2008. It is more in keeping with the $8 billion appropriated in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ) for high-speed rail. The bill defines \"high-speed\" as rail service that is reasonably expected to reach speeds of at least 110 miles per hour. The high-speed rail development program, as promulgated in section 6001 of the draft bill, would require a local match of 20% and allow the Secretary of Transportation to issue \"letters of intent\" regarding federal funding of specific projects in future years. States or Amtrak may enter into a cooperative agreement with any public, private, or non-profit entity to implement a high-speed rail project.", "Although the bill authorizes a substantial increase in funding for modernizing the nation's passenger rail network, without a dedicated funding source, which has benefitted the development of other modes of intercity travel, it is uncertain whether Congress can sustain, over the long-term, the level of funding it recently appropriated to passenger rail in ARRA. Sustaining higher levels of capital funding is not the only challenge confronting decision-makers. On many of the proposed routes it is unlikely that ticket and other revenues will be sufficient to cover operating costs, requiring public assistance to cover these losses in addition to funding infrastructure maintenance and improvements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Related Legislation", "paragraphs": ["Several Members of Congress have introduced legislation that would, if adopted or incorporated into the major reauthorization bill, have an impact on federal surface transportation policy.

The bill requires money from 10% of the auctioned allowances to be deposited in the fund.

A state opting out of the highway program would instead receive an amount equivalent to the state's contribution to the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund, less an amount to be determined by the Secretary to pay a portion of the funding necessary to maintain NHTSA and FMCSA activities. As part of this transfer, the state would agree to continue certain aspects of the existing highway program, such as the urbanized area suballocation distribution that would have occurred as part of the STP program. In addition, a state would agree to maintain the interstates and submit a plan on how the funds obtained from this transfer would be utilized.", "S. 903 is a donor state bill. By transferring funds directly to the state instead of through the existing federal aid program it addresses many of the long standing complaints expressed by donor states that they do not receive a full return on their contributions to the trust fund. At its core the bill is a policy statement favoring partial devolution of the surface transportation assistance program. It is partial because it deals only with the spending side of the program. The federal government would still be required to collect taxes and transfer them to the states. In some ways this process would be similar to the revenue sharing policies adopted during the Nixon Administration and repealed under the Reagan Administration.", "The bill as introduced does not contain detailed implementation provisions. The bill does not, for example, provide guidance on how the regulatory structure for this program restructuring would be created. One could assume that the Secretary would have this role, but the legislation does not make this clear.
