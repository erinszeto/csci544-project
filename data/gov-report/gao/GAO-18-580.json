IHS also offers other financial incentives, and has made some housing available when possible. In addition, IHS uses strategies, such as contracting with temporary providers, to maintain patient access to services and reduce provider burnout. Officials said these temporary providers are more costly than salaried employees and can interrupt patients' continuity of care. However, IHS lacks agency-wide information on the costs and number of temporary providers used at its facilities, which impedes IHS officials' ability to target its resources to address gaps in provider staffing and ensure access to health services across IHS facilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that IHS obtain, on an agency-wide basis, information on temporary provider contractors, including their associated cost and number of full-time equivalents, and use this information to inform decisions about resource allocation and provider staffing.", "IHS concurred with GAO's recommendation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Indian Health Service (IHS), an agency within the Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS), is charged with providing health care  services to the approximately 2.2 million American Indian and Alaska  Native (AI/AN) people who are members or descendants of 573 federally  recognized tribes. According to IHS, its agency-wide goal is to ensure  comprehensive, culturally acceptable personal and public health services  are available and accessible to AI/AN people. One of the agency\u2019s  priorities is to recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent  workforce that provides health care services in IHS\u2019s 12 geographic areas  either directly through a system of federally operated IHS facilities or  through facilities that are operated by tribes or others. Federally operated  IHS facilities are located in ten of these geographic areas, which are  mostly in rural areas, and are overseen by IHS area offices. In the  remaining two geographic areas, all facilities are tribally operated.  According to IHS, AI/AN people born today have a life expectancy that is  5.5 years less than all races in the United States, and they die at higher  rates than other Americans from many preventable causes, including  diabetes, suicide, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, and chronic lower  respiratory diseases.

In 2016, we reported  that, according to IHS, an insufficient workforce was the biggest  impediment to ensuring patients\u2019 access to timely primary care. In  addition, that same year, HHS\u2019s Office of Inspector General reported that  vacancies at IHS, as well as the agency\u2019s use of acting positions,  sometimes limited the availability of services and decreased continuity of  care. According to Healthy People 2020\u2014HHS\u2019s 10-year national  objectives for improving the health of Americans\u2014improving access to  health care services depends in part on ensuring people have a usual  and ongoing source of care, and people with a usual source of care  experience better health outcomes and fewer disparities.", "You asked us to review IHS staffing issues.

IHS provider vacancies and challenges filling them;  2.  strategies IHS has used to recruit and retain providers; and  3.  strategies IHS has used to mitigate the negative effects of provider  vacancies.", "To examine employee vacancies for provider positions at IHS and  challenges in filling those vacancies, we analyzed data collected by IHS  as of November 2017, on the eight provider positions that the agency  tracks\u2014physicians, nurses, dentists, pharmacists, nurse practitioners,  certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNA), certified nurse midwives,  and physician assistants. These data include the number of positions for  each of these types of providers in federally operated IHS facilities, the  number of those positions that were vacant, and the number that were  filled by either civilians or Public Health Service Commissioned Corps  officers\u2014referred to throughout this report as Commissioned Corps  officers\u2014who have taken permanent positions with IHS. We interviewed  IHS officials about these data and conducted manual and electronic tests  to identify any data anomalies. We did not independently verify the  number of reported positions or whether they were filled, nor did we  assess IHS\u2019s method for calculating the total number of positions. We  determined these point-in-time data were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. Through our initial analysis, we determined that 4 of the 12 IHS  areas had relatively few positions for these provider types\u201430 or fewer in  total, compared to 166 to 1,567 in the other 8 areas. We therefore limited  our analyses of vacancies to the 8 IHS areas where IHS has substantial  direct care responsibilities\u2014Albuquerque, Bemidji, Billings, Great Plains,  Navajo, Oklahoma City, Phoenix, and Portland. In addition, we  interviewed officials from IHS headquarters and all 12 area offices about  the causes of IHS provider vacancies and the challenges associated with  filling these positions.", "To examine steps IHS has taken to recruit and retain providers and to  mitigate the negative effects of provider vacancies, we reviewed federal  laws, the Indian Health Manual, IHS guidance, prior GAO reports, and  documentation of area governing board meetings. We also interviewed  officials from IHS headquarters\u2014including officials from IHS\u2019s Office of  Human Resources\u2014and senior officials from all 12 area offices and all 5  regional human resources offices, who assist the area offices in recruiting  and hiring providers. We asked these officials about how the agency has  assessed its vacancy rates, and steps it has taken at the headquarters,  area, and facility-levels to recruit and retain providers. In addition, we  visited 7 federally operated facilities in three different IHS areas and  interviewed staff about steps taken to address provider vacancies. In  addition to geographic diversity, we selected these facilities based on  variation in their number of direct care outpatient visits and inpatient  hospital beds in 2014, the most recent data available. We evaluated steps  taken to address IHS provider vacancies against relevant standards for  internal control in the federal government. In addition, we interviewed  officials from three facilities operated by the Veterans Health  Administration (VHA) and officials from three tribes\u2014entities that also  provide direct health care services\u2014that are located near our selected  IHS facilities to obtain information on strategies they use to fill selected  clinical positions. Our findings are not generalizable to other IHS, VHA,  or tribal facilities.

These federally and tribally operated facilities  are located primarily in service areas that are rural, isolated, and  underserved. In fiscal year 2017, IHS allocated about $1.9 billion for  health services provided by federally and tribally operated facilities.  Federally operated IHS facilities, which received over 5.2 million  outpatient visits and over 15,000 inpatient admissions in 2016, provide  mostly primary and emergency care, as well as some ancillary and  specialty services in 26 hospitals, 55 health centers, and 21 health  stations. According to IHS, federally operated IHS hospitals range in size  from 4 to 133 beds and generally are open 24 hours a day for emergency  care needs; health centers offer a range of care, including primary care  services and some ancillary services, such as pharmacy, laboratory, and  X-ray services, and are open for at least 40 hours a week; and health  stations offer only primary care services on a regularly scheduled basis  and are open fewer than 40 hours a week.", "The 12 IHS area offices are responsible for distributing funds to the  facilities in their areas, monitoring their operation, and providing guidance  and technical assistance (see fig. 1). In addition, five human resources  regional offices assist the area offices in the recruitment and hiring of  providers.", "IHS federally operated facilities employ both federal civil service  personnel and Commissioned Corps officers. IHS may pay higher  salaries for certain federal civil service providers through the development  and implementation of special pay tables, which specify the ranges of  salaries that these certain providers can receive. According to IHS  officials, the Commissioned Corps officers follow the same process for  applying for positions at IHS as federal civil service employees. However,  the Commissioned Corps officers are uniformed health professionals  whose pay and allowances are different. IHS also supplements its  workforce capacity with both temporary and long-term contracts with  individual physicians or a medical staffing company.", "IHS downloads information on all funded and active positions from the  Capital Human Resource Management System, an HHS data system  used for personnel and payment transactions that IHS began using in  2016 to track all employee vacancies.

These  challenges include those related to more complex patient health status  and poorer socioeconomic conditions, as well as physician workforce  shortages. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality,  compared with their urban counterparts, residents of rural counties are  older, poorer, more likely to be overweight or obese, and sicker. Those  living in rural areas also have greater transportation difficulties reaching  health care providers, often traveling great distances to reach a doctor or  hospital. Exacerbating these challenges is a relative scarcity of medical  providers in rural areas compared to urban areas. For example, the  National Center for Health Statistics reported the primary care physician- to-patient ratio in rural areas in 2012 was 39.8 physicians per 100,000  people, compared to 53.3 physicians per 100,000 in urban areas."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "IHS Data Show Sizeable Provider Vacancies and Officials Identified Various Challenges to Filling Them IHS Data Demonstrate Sizeable Provider Vacancies", "paragraphs": ["IHS data demonstrate large percentages of vacancies for providers in the  8 areas in which IHS has substantial direct care responsibilities.

(See fig. 2)", "However, variation in vacancy rates existed among provider types across  IHS areas. For example, while the overall percentage of vacancies for  physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, dentists, and physician assistants  each exceeded 25 percent, the vacancy rate for pharmacists was less  than 25 percent. In addition, for certain provider types in some areas,  more than one-third of the positions were vacant. For example, although  29 percent of the total positions for physicians across these 8 areas were  vacant, the vacancy rate ranged from 21 percent in the Oklahoma City  area to 46 percent in the Bemidji and Billings areas. (See fig. 3.)", "As another example, although 27 percent of the total positions for nurses  across these 8 areas were vacant, the vacancy rate ranged from 10  percent in the Oklahoma City area to 36 percent in the Albuquerque and  Bemidji areas.

According to IHS  officials, the rural locations and geographic isolation of some IHS facilities  create recruitment and retention difficulties. IHS data indicate that 36 of  the 102 IHS facilities, including four hospitals, are identified as isolated  hardship (ISOHAR) posts. Agency documentation describes ISOHAR  posts as \u2018\u2018unusually difficult, which may present moderate to severe  physical hardships for individuals assigned to that geographic location,\u2019\u2019  and states that physical hardships may include crime or violence,  pollution, isolation, a harsh climate, scarcity of goods on the local market,  and other problems. In addition, IHS has reported that insufficient  housing, substandard schools, lack of entertainment opportunities, and  shopping centers located more than three hours away are all typical not  only of ISOHAR posts, but also of many other IHS facility locations.  Officials stated that, especially for job candidates and employees with  families, these can be critical factors in choosing whether or not to accept  or stay in a position. For example, officials from the Portland Area office  told us the Colville Service Unit has experienced challenges recruiting  physicians because the service unit is 110 miles away from Spokane, and  many of the smaller towns nearby have limited amenities\u2014including  limited employment opportunities for spouses and school systems that  may not meet the expectations of some prospective employees.", "In addition to hardships generally associated with rural locations, IHS  facilities can experience additional challenges specific to recruiting and  retaining providers for facilities on tribal lands. For example, Navajo area  officials told us that providers who are non-native or are not married to a  tribal member generally must go off the reservation to find housing if it is  not provided by IHS. According to IHS, the Navajo Nation is one of the  largest Indian reservations in the United States, consisting of more than  25,000 contiguous square miles and three satellite communities, and  extending into portions of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. Living off the  reservation can result in long commutes, contributing to a difficult work- life balance. Furthermore, IHS officials noted, public transportation such  as buses or trains do not exist in proximity to most IHS facilities.", "IHS facility staff told us long-standing vacancies have a direct negative  effect on patient access to quality health care, as well as employee  morale. Officials from multiple facilities we visited told us they have had to  cut certain patient services due to ongoing provider vacancies. For  example, officials from the Phoenix Area office told us the Nevada Skies  Youth Wellness Center, an adolescent substance abuse treatment center,  decreased the number of beds available due to staffing vacancies.  Similarly, officials from the Rosebud Hospital stated the facility has  diverted obstetrics patients to other facilities since July 2016 due to a  shortage of physicians, nurses, and nurse anesthetists. During the  diversion, those patients were referred to other hospitals in Valentine,  Nebraska, and Winner, South Dakota\u2014about 45 miles away. An official  from the Sioux San Hospital said that because of vacancies in the  diagnostic testing laboratory, the hospital stopped conducting Chlamydia  tests in-house and instead sends specimens out to another laboratory for  testing. As a result, the official stated it takes about a week longer to get  the test results, which can delay treatment. In addition facility staff we  interviewed told us the increased stress and fatigue of providers working  to make up for staffing shortages results in decreased employee morale.  These staff stated that, in some cases, this stress and fatigue has caused  providers to leave IHS. One doctor we spoke with described this dynamic  of vacancies begetting additional vacancies as a \u201cnever-ending cycle\u201d for  the facility."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "IHS Uses Multiple Strategies to Recruit and Retain Providers", "paragraphs": ["In an effort to recruit and retain permanent employees, IHS has used  strategies that are similar to strategies used by VHA and tribal facilities in  our review.

The agency has also taken steps to recruit students and connect with  potential applicants through webinars, career fairs, and conferences."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Salaries and Other Financial Incentives", "paragraphs": ["IHS offers increased special salary rates for certain health care positions,  as well as other financial incentives, such as recruitment and retention  bonuses. IHS also offers student loan repayments, in return for health  professionals\u2019 commitment to work at IHS for a specified period of time.", "Special salary rates. IHS offers special higher salary rates for  physicians, dentists, nurses, CRNAs, certified nurse midwives, nurse  practitioners, optometrists, pharmacists, and physician assistants.  IHS officials stated that special salary rates are an important  recruitment and retention tool for providers, and that without them,  federally operated IHS facilities would be at a competitive  disadvantage with the private sector, VHA, and tribally operated  facilities. In 2015 IHS reported that recruiting and retaining CRNAs  was \u201can ongoing problem for IHS\u2014mostly due to pay,\u201d and the  agency rarely had \u201ca sufficient applicant pool.\u201d IHS reported \u201cCRNA  services were integral to IHS operations\u201d and without the ability to  recruit and retain these providers, IHS was \u201cat risk of having to curtail  services to clients.\u201d As a result, according to IHS officials, the  agency developed special salary rates for CRNAs, which became  effective on December 31, 2015. As of November 2017, IHS had no  CRNA vacancies.", "However, according to IHS officials, the agency has only developed  seven national special pay tables and two local special pay tables for  Alaska, as of January 2018, due to a lack of human resources personnel  trained in this process. Officials told us only one human resources staff  person at IHS is experienced with developing special pay tables, which  takes a substantial amount of work. However, they stated that this task is  only one of her job responsibilities, and she can complete about one  special pay table each year. In comparison, according to an official, VHA  has developed and regularly revises over 3,000 special salary rates  based on local market conditions. For example, IHS officials stated that  Phoenix Indian Medical Center cannot offer salaries that are competitive  with VHA because salaries for providers in the Phoenix area are relatively  high compared to national salaries, and IHS has not developed local  salary rates in the Phoenix market. For example, using pay rates effective  January 7, 2018, a nurse just starting a career in the Phoenix area could  make $63,871 at VHA (local pay table), versus $44,835 at IHS (national  pay table).", "Although offering increased salaries is an important strategy that IHS  uses for recruitment, IHS still experiences challenges in offering  competitive salaries. Officials from two area offices told us the maximum  amount for a physician salary or certain nursing salaries were not enough  for some potential hires, who sought employment elsewhere. While IHS  may seek approval from HHS to exceed the maximum salary of certain  pay tables, IHS officials said the approval process can be lengthy, which  has resulted in the loss of promising candidates\u2014including emergency  medicine, general surgery, radiology, and anesthesiologist providers.  Similarly, officials from one area office stated that federally operated IHS  facilities have experienced challenges competing with other health care  systems in recruiting local health care providers, including tribally  operated facilities. For example, officials from the Oklahoma City area  office told us their area has four of the largest American Indian tribes in  the country running their own health systems. According to these officials,  in addition to IHS funds, these tribes use money from other sources to  pay health care salaries. IHS officials explained that, as a result, tribes  can pay higher salaries and may be able to offer other incentives that IHS  is unable to provide.", "Recruitment, relocation, and retention incentives. IHS may offer  recruitment, relocation, and retention incentives. Specifically, for  positions that are difficult to fill or for individuals who are unlikely to  accept the position without an incentive, IHS may offer potential  employees a recruitment incentive up to 25 percent of their annual  salary. IHS may also pay a relocation incentive for a current employee  who must relocate for a position that would otherwise be difficult to  fill.  In addition, IHS may pay a retention incentive of up to 25  percent of an employee\u2019s current salary if he or she (1) has unusually  high or unique qualifications or if there is a special need of the  agency, which makes retention essential, or (2) is likely to leave IHS  without the retention incentive. Officials from the Phoenix area office  told us IHS facilities use the retention bonuses extensively for nursing  staff, in particular, to help match the market pay. IHS also analyzed  the recruitment and retention of nurses and, as a result of this  analysis, requested an exception to the 25 percent limit on  recruitment, relocation, and retention incentives, from the Office of  Personnel Management (OPM). In December, 2017, OPM approved  IHS\u2019s request to offer incentives up to 50 percent, and IHS officials  told us that they are currently reviewing implementation options.", "Loan repayment. IHS\u2019s Loan Repayment Program pays provider  education loans in exchange for an initial two-year service  commitment to practice in health facilities serving AI/AN  communities. Recipients agree to serve two years in exchange for  up to $20,000 per year in loan repayment funding and up to an  additional $5,000 per year to offset tax liability, which IHS pays  directly to the Internal Revenue Service. Loan repayment recipients  can extend their initial two-year contract on an annual basis until their  original approved educational loan debt is paid. In fiscal year 2017, a  total of 1,267 providers\u2014about 8 percent of the federal IHS  workforce\u2014were receiving IHS loan repayments. This included 434  new two-year contracts, 396 one-year extension contracts, and 437  providers starting the second year of their fiscal year 2016 two-year  contract. However, IHS\u2019s Loan Repayment Program is not able to pay  for the loans of all providers who request it due to limited funding.  According to officials in one area office, this has caused providers to  either decline a job offer or leave IHS. According to IHS\u2019s fiscal year  2019 budget justification, in fiscal year 2017, 412 providers employed  by IHS who applied for loan repayment, did not receive one. An  additional 376 applicants either declined a job offer because they did  not receive loan repayment funding or were unable to find a suitable  assignment meeting their personal or professional needs. Officials in  the Billings Area Office told us several physicians stated during exit  interviews that they were leaving because they did not receive the  loan repayment funding they hoped to receive. According to area  office officials, the Billings area lost 5 physicians in 2 weeks because  they were not awarded loan repayments.", "In addition to its own loan repayment program, IHS has worked with  HHS\u2019s Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to increase  opportunities for providers to apply for loan repayment through the  National Health Service Corps. Specifically, IHS worked with HRSA to  increase the number of facilities deemed medically underserved and  therefore designated Health Professional Shortage Areas. According to  IHS, this resulted in 684 health care delivery sites for placement of  National Health Service Corps providers, and the number of placements  increased to 443 providers as of August 2016.

The IHS Scholarship program also reviewed applications  from previously awarded scholars who were continuing their  education. In fiscal year 2017, 154 continuation awards were funded.  In addition to the scholarship program, according to IHS officials, the  agency funds two medical students enrolled at the Uniformed Service  University of the Health Sciences each year. Each graduate agrees to  a 10-year obligation to IHS after medical school graduation and  completion of training. In future years, IHS endeavors to fund two  additional medical students at the Uniformed Service University of  Health Sciences.", "Externships and internships. IHS provides scholarship recipients  with opportunities to receive clinical experience in IHS facilities. In  fiscal year 2017, the agency funded 94 students, who were employed  for 30 to 120 workdays per calendar year. In addition, IHS provides  externships to students temporarily called to active duty as  Commissioned Corps officers through the Commissioned Officer  Student Training and Extern Program (COSTEP). IHS officials said  that the agency funded about 60-70 students in COSTEP in 2016.  IHS also offers a Virtual Internship program through a partnership with  the Department of State. Virtual interns spend 10 hours a week from  September through May working remotely on their projects, which  have included producing bilingual Navajo and English videos for rural  health clinics, developing Navajo-specific health education materials  on palliative care, improving behavioral health data collection  methods, and creating social media strategies and campaigns for  health promotion. For the 2017-2018 academic year, about 15  students are participating in virtual internships with IHS.", "Residency rotations. IHS service units offer rotation opportunities for  medical, nursing, optometry, dental, and pharmacy residents as a  recruitment tool because research shows students are likely to stay  and practice medicine in the area where they studied. For example,  the Oklahoma City area has a Memorandum of Agreement with the  Oklahoma State College of Medicine, which permits area officials to  annually recruit up to two residents from the current year\u2019s residency  class to become federal employees while completing their residency  program. For every year that IHS sponsors the residents\u2019 position at  the university, the resident has a one-year service obligation. In  addition, IHS officials from Chinle stated that the service unit  participates in educational agreements with numerous universities  and residency programs to host medical students, nursing students,  and medical residents for rotations. According to officials, recent  graduates from residency programs applying for permanent positions  with the Chinle Comprehensive Health Care Facility often cite prior  rotations at the service unit, or word of mouth from students or  residents who have rotated through the service unit, as a reason for  applying. The IHS Pharmacy Resident Program is another recruitment  program that offers residency training to pharmacists who are willing  to serve in high-need locations. Pharmacy residents who are  Commissioned Corps officers are required to complete 2 years of  service at an IHS federal or tribal facility. Twenty-six Commissioned  Corps and civilian pharmacists participate in the Pharmacy Residency  Program.

The Telebehavioral Health Center of  Excellence provides direct care services through video conferencing  to patients at remote facilities from providers at IHS facilities that are  able to provide the services. These services are provided in all IHS  areas with federally operated facilities, and more than 5,800 patient  visits occurred in 2016. Additionally, officials told us there are regional  telebehavioral health programs, such as in the Oklahoma City area  that, combined with the Telebehavioral Health Center of Excellence,  saw over 10,000 patients in 2016. IHS officials stated that patients  appreciate the telebehavioral services in their communities, because  they are the only behavioral health services available in many  communities. The IHS psychiatrist who provides services is located in  Oklahoma City because, according to IHS officials, it is easier to  recruit providers to a more urban location.", "In addition to these agency-wide telehealth programs, IHS officials  identified multiple other local telehealth arrangements that facility staff  have developed to help maintain patient access to medical services. For  example, there is a diabetes consultant for the Portland area who  conducts telenutrition services. There is also a teledermatology program  for the Phoenix Area federal facilities operated out of the Phoenix Indian  Medical Center.

Officials from the Kayenta Health Center said they  contract with temporary providers to compensate for vacancies, and  the facility contracts with about 9 providers who rotate to fill 3 vacant  emergency department positions. Officials from the Portland area  stated that they use temporary providers when there is a staffing  shortage with providers. They explained that the Portland area has  provider vacancies that have been open for years, and temporary  providers fill these vacancies for an extended period of time, usually  with a rotating series of providers. Chinle Health Care Facility officials  said temporary providers, when of sufficiently high quality, have been  recruited to join the permanent corps of civilian service staff. However,  they told us locum tenens can cost between $50,000-$200,000 more  annually than permanent physicians\u2019 salaries, exclusive of benefits,  depending on the specialties and hourly rates associated with the  contracts. They said they are finding that increasingly higher hourly  rates are needed to ensure a sufficient supply of high-quality  temporary providers.", "IHS officials at all levels of the agency told us they prefer to hire  permanent providers, rather than use locum tenens contracts. Facility  officials explained that persistent turnover in temporary staff may  jeopardize continuity of care. For example, Sioux San Medical Center  officials expressed concern about the quality of the care provided by  temporary contractors, as well as the consistency of the care provided  because the contractors rotate frequently. IHS officials told us that  many providers prefer to be on contract due to the higher  compensation rates as a contractor, even when taking federal benefits  into account.", "University physicians. IHS officials explained that area offices may  also contract with university fellowship programs to provide visiting  providers. For example, according to IHS, the Chinle Health Care  Facility has entered into long-term contractual agreements with two  academic fellowship programs\u2014University of California-San  Francisco Health Program and the University of Utah Global Health  Fellowship. Officials told us these programs provide U.S. residency- trained, board certified physicians interested in global health to work  6-month assignments alternating with another fellow at an  international site. In addition, IHS officials stated that the Navajo area  office is collaborating with the University of California-San Francisco  and its global health fellowship to assign global health fellows to a  Navajo Area site for 6 months out of each year. The officials explained  that 24 fellows were placed in Navajo-area facilities in 2017 at costs  substantially lower than that of locum tenens contracts.

While IHS has agency-wide information on  vacancies through the Capital Human Resource Management System,  IHS delegates the acquisitions process for temporary provider contracts  to the head of each area-level Contracting Office. Therefore, agency-wide  information on the number of full-time equivalent employees that are  temporary providers working at IHS facilities, as well as the cost of these  providers, is not readily available. As discussed, officials we spoke with  at IHS facilities told us that temporary providers can cost more depending  on the specialties and hourly rates. Without agency-wide information on  the extent to which such providers are used, IHS is not fully informed  about facilities\u2019 reliance and expenditures on temporary providers or their  potential effect on patient care, which is inconsistent with federal internal  control standards regarding the availability of relevant information to  facilitate management decision making and performance monitoring.  Specifically, federal internal controls standards state that agency  management should obtain, process, and use quality information to make  informed decisions and evaluate the agency\u2019s performance in achieving  key objectives and addressing risks. IHS\u2019s lack of agency-wide  information on the costs and number of temporary providers used at its  facilities impedes its ability to make decisions about how best to target its  resources to address gaps in provider staffing and ensure that health  services are available and accessible across IHS facilities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Maintaining a stable clinical workforce capable of providing quality and  timely care is critical for IHS to ensure that comprehensive health  services are available and accessible to American Indian/Alaska Native  people.
