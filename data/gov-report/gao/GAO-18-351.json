Adding to this financial challenge, the coal tax that supports the Trust Fund is scheduled to decrease by about 55 percent beginning in 2019. GAO was asked to review the financial positon of the Trust Fund and identify options to improve it.", "This report examines (1) factors that have challenged the financial position of the Trust Fund since its inception and (2) the extent to which Trust Fund debt may change through 2050, and selected options that could improve its future financial position. GAO reviewed Trust Fund financial data from fiscal years 1979 through 2017. GAO also interviewed officials from the Departments of Labor, Treasury, Health and Human Services (HHS) and representatives of coal industry and union groups. Using assumptions, such as the about 55 percent coal tax decrease and moderately declining coal production, GAO simulated the extent to which Trust Fund debt may change through 2050.

Its expenditures have consistently exceeded its revenues, interest payments have grown, and actions taken that were expected to improve Trust Fund finances did not completely address its debt. When necessary to make expenditures, the Trust Fund borrows with interest from the Department of the Treasury's (Treasury) general fund. Because Trust Fund expenditures have consistently exceeded revenue, it has borrowed almost every year since 1979, its first complete fiscal year, and as a result debt and interest payments increased. Legislative actions were taken over the years including (1) raising the rate of the coal tax that provides Trust Fund revenues and (2) forgiving debt. For example, the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 provided an appropriation toward Trust Fund debt forgiveness; about $6.5 billion was forgiven, according to Department of Labor (DOL) data (see figure). However, coal tax revenues were less than expected due, in part, to the 2008 recession and increased competition from other energy sources, according to DOL and Treasury officials. As a result, the Trust Fund continued to borrow from Treasury's general fund from fiscal years 2010 through 2017 to cover debt repayment expenditures.", "GAO's simulation suggests that Trust Fund borrowing will likely increase from fiscal years 2019 through 2050 due, in part, to the coal tax rate decrease of about 55 percent that will take effect in 2019 and declining coal production. The simulation estimates that Trust Fund borrowing may exceed $15 billion by 2050 (see figure). However, various options, such as adjusting the coal tax and forgiving interest or debt, could reduce future borrowing and improve the Trust Fund's financial position. For example, maintaining the current coal tax rates and forgiving debt of $2.4 billion could, under certain circumstances, balance the Trust Fund by 2050, whereby revenue would be sufficient to cover expenditures. However, a coal industry representative said that maintaining or increasing the coal tax would burden the coal industry, particularly at a time when coal production has been declining.

That Act authorized the Trust Fund to pay benefits  in certain circumstances including in cases where no responsible mine  operator could be identified or when the liable mine operator does not  pay.

Beginning in calendar year 2019, the coal tax will decrease by  approximately 55 percent which, in turn, will increase borrowing,  according to DOL projections. Additionally, coal production has been  declining as the coal industry faces challenges from increased  competition from other energy sources, which may further affect future  Trust Fund revenue.

We  primarily focused on changes to the coal tax rates and other legislative  actions taken that were expected to improve the financial position of the  Trust Fund, such as debt refinancing and forgiveness provisions  contained in the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 (EIEA).  We also reviewed publicly available Trust Fund financial data obtained  from the DOL Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs\u2019 Annual  Reports to Congress and annual bulletins issued by the Treasury.

For example, we  reviewed the annual amounts of coal tax revenue collected and the  annual amounts paid by the Trust Fund in black lung benefits,  administrative costs, and debt servicing. We assessed the reliability of the  data by discussing it with relevant agency officials and reviewing it for  missing data, outliers, or obvious errors. We determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our review. Additionally, we  interviewed officials from DOL\u2019s Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation  Programs and Mine Safety and Health Administration; the Department of  the Treasury\u2019s Offices of Federal Program Finance and Tax Analysis; the  Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) National Institute for  Occupational Safety and Health and the Health Resources and Services  Administration, which funds black-lung-related grant programs; the  National Mining Association (an organization that represents the mining  industry); and the United Mine Workers of America (an organization that  represents coal miners).", "To address our second objective, we simulated the extent to which Trust  Fund debt may change through 2050 and how various options may affect  future Trust Fund finances. Our simulations are based on various  assumptions and simulate Trust Fund revenues and expenditures from  fiscal years 2016 through 2050.

We ran each  simulation multiple times using different sets of assumptions about the  number of future black lung beneficiaries and future coal production.  Doing so provided a range of estimates about the Trust Fund\u2019s future  borrowing needs and provided insight on the sensitivity of its overall  financial position relative to its various revenues and expenditures. In this  report, we generally present the results of a moderate set of assumptions  for each simulation.

The  decrease in the number of beneficiaries over time has resulted from a  combination of declining coal mining employment and an aging  beneficiary population, according to DOL officials. Further, black lung  beneficiaries could increase in the near term due to the increased  occurrence of black lung disease and its most severe form, progressive  massive fibrosis, particularly among Appalachian coal miners, according  to HHS officials.", "Black lung claims are processed by DOL\u2019s Office of Workers\u2019  Compensation Programs.

The coal tax is imposed at two rates,  depending on whether the coal is extracted from underground or surface  mines. The current tax rates are $1.10 per ton of underground-mined coal  and $0.55 per ton of surface-mined coal, up to 4.4 percent of the sales  price. Therefore, if a ton of underground-mined coal is sold for less than  $25, than the tax paid would be less than $1.10. For instance, if a ton of  underground-mined coal sold for $20, than it would be taxed at 4.4  percent of the sales price, or $0.88. To a lesser extent, the Trust Fund  also receives other miscellaneous revenue from interest payments, and  various fines and penalties paid by mine operators, among other sources,  according to DOL documentation. Coal tax revenue is collected from mine  operators by Treasury\u2019s Internal Revenue Service and then transferred to  the Trust Fund where it is then used by DOL officials to pay black lung  benefits and the costs of administering the program.", "Trust Fund expenditures include, among other things, black lung benefit  payments, certain administrative costs incurred by DOL and Treasury to  administer the black lung benefits program, and debt repayments.

Combined black lung benefit payments and  program administrative costs exceeded Trust Fund revenue every year  for the program\u2019s first decade (fiscal years 1979 through 1989), resulting  in the accrual of debt. During the Trust Fund\u2019s first three fiscal years in  particular, revenue covered less than 40 percent of the Trust Fund\u2019s  combined benefit payments and administrative costs. For instance, in  fiscal year 1980, the Trust Fund received about $251 million in revenue  and paid about $726 million in black lung benefits and administrative  costs.", "Beginning in 1982, revenue increased as a result of the Black Lung  Benefits Revenue Act of 1981 that doubled the coal tax rates from $0.50  to $1 per ton of underground-mined coal and from $0.25 to $0.50 per ton  of surface-mined coal, up to 4 percent of the sales price. Even with the  tax rate increase, combined benefit payments and administrative costs  continued to exceed revenue throughout the 1980s (see fig. 2). As a  result, the Trust Fund borrowed from Treasury\u2019s general fund to cover the  annual differences between its expenditures and revenues, and by fiscal  year 1989 the Trust Fund\u2019s outstanding debt to Treasury\u2019s general fund  exceeded $3 billion.", "Beginning in fiscal year 1990, Trust Fund revenue generally began to  exceed combined benefit payments and administrative costs, and, in fact,  total Trust Fund cumulative revenue collected from fiscal years 1979 through 2017 exceeded total cumulative benefit payments and  administrative costs incurred during these years. However, interest owed  from earlier years of borrowing led to more borrowing and debt. From  fiscal years 1979 through 1989, the Trust Fund borrowed\u2014primarily  through 30-year term loans according to Treasury officials\u2014from  Treasury\u2019s general fund at interest rates that varied from about 6.5  percent to about 13.9 percent. In fiscal year 1985, for instance, the Trust  Fund paid about $275 million in interest, which was equal to about half of  the total revenue collected that year. Since fiscal year 1990, revenue  has generally exceeded combined benefit payments and administrative  costs, although interest payments on the Trust Fund\u2019s outstanding debt  kept the fund in a position whereby its total expenditures continued to  exceed its total revenues.

For instance, in fiscal year 2029, simulated  benefit payments and administrative costs will likely exceed simulated  revenue by about $99 million. These annual deficits will likely decrease  over time to about $4 million by fiscal year 2050 due, in part, to the  assumed continued net decline in total black lung beneficiaries.

Treasury officials noted  that the costs associated with forgiving Trust Fund interest or debt would  be borne by the general taxpayer since Treasury borrows from taxpayers  to lend to the Trust Fund as needed.

Another option could be to eliminate or  adjust the coal tax cap, which currently prevents mine operators from  paying a coal tax of more than 4.4 percent of the price per ton of coal  sold. If the coal tax cap were eliminated, for instance, mine operators  would pay $1.10 per ton of underground-mined coal and $0. 55 per ton of  surface-mined coal regardless of price sold, which could increase  revenue.

We then used EIA data on projected  amounts of total coal production, underground-mined coal production,  lignite coal production, and coal exports, as well as projected average  coal prices, for the period from 2015 through 2050 to simulate future coal  tax revenues (see table 3).", "We simulated other Trust Fund expenditures and revenues, including  administrative costs and debt repayments (see table 4). For our  simulations, total Trust Fund expenditures are the sum of black lung  benefits (cash assistance and medical benefits), total administrative  costs, repayment of interest and principal on outstanding debt to  Treasury\u2019s general fund, and other expenditures. Total Trust Fund  revenues are the sum of coal tax revenue and other miscellaneous  revenue, and exclude annual borrowing from Treasury\u2019s general fund.  Annual borrowing from Treasury\u2019s general fund is the difference between  total Trust Fund expenditures and revenues and is assumed to be repaid  with interest the following year. If total revenues are greater than total  expenditures, then the Trust Fund has a balance and would not have to  borrow that year. In this case, we assumed that the Trust Fund will earn  interest on that balance at the same rate on which interest would accrue  on annual borrowing.", "We simulated how the scheduled 2019 tax rate decrease and various  options including adjusting the coal tax, forgiving debt interest, and  forgiving debt principal and interest may affect Trust Fund finances  through fiscal year 2050 (see table 5).

For options that involve adjusting coal tax rates,  we estimated the amount of debt that would need to be forgiven in fiscal  year 2019 for the Trust Fund\u2019s revenues to be sufficient to cover its  expenditures through fiscal year 2050, assuming the Trust Fund does not  borrow from Treasury\u2019s general fund after fiscal year 2018. To do so, we  first calculated the real discounted present value of Trust Fund  expenditures for fiscal years 2019 through 2050, including benefit  payments, administrative costs, legacy debt repayments, and repayment  of annual borrowing from Treasury\u2019s general fund. Second, we calculated  the real discounted present value of Trust Fund revenue for the same  period, including coal tax revenue and other miscellaneous revenue.  Third, we calculated debt forgiveness as the difference between the real  discounted present value of Trust Fund expenditures from the first  calculation and the real discounted present value of Trust Fund revenues  from the second calculation. When the amount of debt forgiveness is  greater than the amount of debt outstanding, the Trust Fund would need  an additional cash inflow in addition to forgiveness of all outstanding debt.  Amounts of debt forgiveness less than zero suggest that no debt  forgiveness is required.", "For options involving forgiving debt (interest or principal), we estimated  the average tax per ton of coal that, if implemented in fiscal year 2019,  would provide the Trust Fund sufficient revenue to cover its expenditures  through fiscal year 2050, assuming the Trust Fund does not receive any  advances from Treasury\u2019s general fund after fiscal year 2018. To do so,  we first calculated the real discounted present value of Trust Fund  expenditures for the period from fiscal year 2019 through fiscal year 2050,  again including benefit payments, administrative costs, legacy debt  repayments, and repayment of annual borrowing from Treasury\u2019s general  fund, minus the real discounted present value of miscellaneous revenues  for the same period. Second, we calculated the real discounted present  value of coal production for the same period. Third, we calculated the  average tax per ton of coal as the first amount divided by the second  amount.", "To assess the sensitivity of each option, we ran each simulation 36 times  using four different sets of assumptions about the numbers of future  beneficiaries and nine different sets of assumptions about future coal production and prices (see table 6). Doing so provided a range of  estimates about the Trust Fund\u2019s future borrowing needs and provided  insight on the sensitivity of its overall financial position relative to its  various expenditures and revenues. The analysis also provided a range  of estimates of the amount of debt forgiveness needed to bring the Trust  Fund into balance by fiscal year 2050, assuming various coal tax rates,  and the average tax collection per ton needed to do the same, and  assuming various amounts of debt forgiveness.", "From the range of estimates that resulted from our sensitivity analysis, we  selected cases with moderate expectations related to future Trust Fund  expenditures and revenue. Specifically, for future expenditures, we  assumed an average growth rate of new black lung beneficiaries for fiscal  years 2003 through 2015 as a moderate case that reflects historical  experience. For future revenue, we used a moderate coal production  outlook based on EIA\u2019s reference case, which reflects moderate  expectations about future coal production based on various assumptions  about economic growth, oil prices, technological innovation, and energy  policy."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Results of GAO\u2019s Black Lung Disability Trust Fund Simulations", "paragraphs": ["We summarized the results of our simulations by showing the extent to  which the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund\u2019s (Trust Fund) balance\u2014the  sum of tax revenue and miscellaneous revenue less expenditures\u2014may  change in fiscal year 2050 for each option simulated.

We  simulated how various coal tax and debt forgiveness options could  balance the Trust Fund by fiscal year 2050, whereby its simulated  revenue would be sufficient to cover its simulated expenditures. We  approached these simulations from two perspectives. First, we simulated  how much Trust Fund debt would need to be forgiven based on various  coal tax rates. Second, we simulated the average tax collected per ton  needed to balance the Trust Fund by 2050, based on certain debt  forgiveness options.", "For our first set of simulations, we calculated the amount of debt  outstanding in fiscal year 2019 and the amount that would likely need to  be forgiven in fiscal year 2019 for the Trust Fund to have sufficient  revenues to cover its expenditures by fiscal year 2050, assuming that it  does not borrow from Treasury\u2019s general fund after fiscal year 2018. For  example, before any options are implemented, our moderate case  simulations suggest that the Trust Fund\u2019s outstanding debt in fiscal year  2019\u2014including both legacy debt and annual borrowing from Treasury\u2019s  general fund\u2014would likely be about $6.6 billion (after discounting and  adjusting for inflation). Therefore, with implementation of the coal tax rate  decrease of about 55 percent as scheduled in calendar year 2019, about  117.7 percent of that debt would need to be forgiven to balance the Trust  Fund. In other words, balancing the Trust Fund would require forgiveness  of $6.6 billion and an additional cash inflow of about $1.2 billion because  the Trust Fund will accrue additional debt from fiscal years 2020 through  2050, according to our moderate case simulations (see table 8).", "For our second set of simulations, we estimated the average tax per ton  of coal that, if implemented in fiscal year 2019, would likely provide the  Trust Fund sufficient revenues to cover its expenditures in fiscal year  2050, assuming that it does not borrow from Treasury\u2019s general fund after  fiscal year 2018. For example, if all principal and interest on Trust Fund  legacy debt is forgiven, as of 2019, the estimated average tax that  balances the Trust Fund is about $0.59 per ton (see table 9). Based on  certain assumptions, this could be accomplished with a tax of $0.88 per  ton on underground-mined coal and $0.44 per ton on surface-mined  coal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Blake Ainsworth (Assistant  Director), Justin Dunleavy (analyst-in-charge), Angeline Bickner,  Courtney LaFountain, and Rosemary Torres Lerma made key  contributions to this report.
