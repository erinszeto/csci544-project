The Choice Program allows eligible veterans to obtain health care services from providers not directly employed by VA (community providers), who are then reimbursed for their services through one of the program's two third-party administrators (TPA). GAO's analysis of TPA data available for November 2014 through June 2018 shows that the length of time the TPAs took to pay community providers' clean claims each month varied widely\u2014from 7 days to 68 days. VA and its TPAs identified several key factors affecting timeliness of payments to community providers under the Choice Program, including VA's untimely payments to TPAs, which in turn extended the length of time TPAs took to pay community providers' claims; and inadequate provider education on filing claims.", "VA has taken actions to address key factors that have contributed to the length of time TPAs have taken to pay community providers. For example, VA updated its payment system and related processes to pay TPAs more quickly. According to VA data, as of July 2018, VA was paying at least 90 percent of the TPAs' invoices within 7 days. In addition, VA and the TPAs have taken steps to improve provider education to help providers resolve claims processing issues. However, 9 of the 15 providers GAO interviewed said they continue to experience lengthy telephone hold times. According to VA and TPA officials, steps have been taken to improve the customer service offered to community providers. However, VA officials do not collect data on or monitor TPA compliance with customer service requirements\u2014such as calls being answered within 30 seconds or less\u2014for provider calls because they said they are not enforcing the requirements and are allowing TPAs to prioritize calls from veterans.

External reviews, media reports, and congressional  hearings held over the course of the Choice Program\u2019s implementation  and operation have highlighted several programmatic weaknesses. These  weaknesses have included insufficient community provider networks,  significant delays in scheduling appointments, and a lack of timely  payments by the TPAs to community providers.  Media reports suggest  that the untimely payments to community providers have created financial  hardship for some and a reluctance to continue participating in the Choice  Program. This has raised concerns that a reduction in participating  community providers will increase wait times for veterans and result in  longer travel distances, especially in rural areas. Due to these and other  concerns, we concluded that VA health care is a high-risk area and added  it to our High Risk List in 2015.", "Congress recently passed legislation to help address some of the  challenges faced by the Choice Program and VA\u2019s other community care  programs.

According to VA and TPA  officials, VA made untimely invoice payments to its TPAs\u2014that is,  payments made more than 30 days from the date VA received the TPAs\u2019  invoices\u2014which resulted in the TPAs at times having insufficient funds  available to pay community providers under the Choice Program.  A VA  Office of Inspector General (OIG) report estimated that from November  2014 through September 2016, 50 percent of VA\u2019s payments to its TPAs  during this time frame were untimely.  VA officials stated that VA\u2019s  untimely payments to the TPAs resulted from limitations in its fee-basis  claims system, which VA used at the beginning of the Choice Program to  process all TPA invoices. In addition, the VA OIG found that VA  underestimated the number of staff necessary to process Choice  Program invoices in a timely manner.", "Choice Program reimbursement requirements. According to VA and  TPA officials, three Choice Program requirements, some of which were  more stringent than similar requirements in other federal health care  programs, led to claim denials, which, in turn, contributed to the length of  time TPAs have taken to pay community providers when the providers did  not meet these requirements:  1.  Medical documentation requirement. Prior to a March 2016  contract modification, VA required providers to submit relevant  medical documentation with their claims as a condition of payment  from the TPAs. According to TriWest officials, those Choice  Program claims that did not include medical documentation were  classified by TriWest as non-clean claims and placed in pending  status until the documentation was received. When community  providers did not provide the supporting medical documentation after  a certain period of time, TriWest typically denied their claims.  According to Health Net officials, Choice Program claims that did not  include medical documentation were denied by Health Net.  2.  Timely filing requirement. VA requires providers to file Choice  Program claims within 180 business days from the end of an episode  of care. TPAs deny claims that are not filed within the required time  frame.  3.  Authorization requirement. VA requires authorizations for  community providers to serve veterans under the Choice Program  and receive reimbursement for their services; however, if community  providers deliver care after an authorization period or include services  that are not authorized, the TPAs typically deny their claims.  According to TPA data, denials related to authorizations are among  the most common reasons the TPAs deny community provider claims.", "Inadequate provider education on filing Choice Program claims.  According to VA and TPA officials as well as providers we interviewed,  issues related to inadequate provider education may have contributed to  the length of time it has taken the TPAs to pay community providers  under the Choice Program. These issues have included providers  submitting claims with errors, submitting claims to the wrong payer, or  otherwise failing to meet Choice Program requirements. For example,  some VA community care programs require the claims to be sent to one  of VA\u2019s claims processing locations, while the Choice Program requires  claims to be sent to TriWest or Health Net. Claims sent to the wrong  entity are rejected or denied and have to be resubmitted to the correct  payer. Ten of the 15 providers we interviewed stated that that they lacked  education and/or training on the claims filing process when they first  began participating in the Choice Program, including knowing where to  file claims and the documentation needed to file claims that would be  processed successfully.

Effective in March 2016,  VA modified its TPA contracts and subsequently began monitoring TPA  payment timeliness, requiring TPAs to report information on claims  processing and payment timeliness as well as information on claim  rejections and denials. However, because VA had not established a  payment timeliness requirement, VA officials said that VA had limited  ability to penalize TPAs or compel them to take corrective actions to  address untimely claim payments to community providers. Instead, the  March 2016 contract modification established a non-enforceable goal for  the TPAs to process and pay clean claims within 30 days of receipt.

Specifically, VA has made the  following changes:  In March 2016, VA negotiated a contract modification with both TPAs  that facilitated the processing of certain TPA invoices outside of the  fee basis claims system from March 2016 through July 2016.   According to VA officials, due to the increasing volume of invoices that  the TPAs were expecting to submit to VA during this time period,  without this process change, VA would have experienced a high  volume of TPA invoices entering its fee basis claims system, which  could have exacerbated payment timeliness issues.", "In February through April 2017, VA transitioned all TPA invoice  payments from its fee basis claims system to an expedited payment  process under a new system called Plexis Claims Manager.  VA  officials told us that instead of re-adjudicating community provider  claims as part of its review of TPA invoices, Plexis Claims Manager  performed up front checks in order to pay invoices more quickly, and  any differences in billed and paid amounts were addressed after  payments were issued to the TPAs.", "In January 2018, VA transitioned to a newer version of the Plexis  Claims Manager that enabled VA to once again re-adjudicate  community provider claims as part of processing TPA invoices, but in  a timelier manner compared with the fee basis claims system.  According to VA officials, this is due to the automation of claims  processing under Plexis Claims Manager, which significantly reduced  the need for manual claims processing by VA staff that occurred  under the fee basis claims system.

Effective  beginning March 2016, VA issued a contract modification that eliminated  the requirement that community providers must submit medical  documentation as a condition of receiving payment for their claims. Data  from one TPA showed a reduction in non-clean claims following the  implementation of this contract modification. For example, starting in  April 2016, after this modification was executed, almost 100 percent of claims submitted to TriWest were classified as clean claims, as opposed  to 49 percent of claims submitted in March 2016. However, when the  modification first went into effect in March 2016, TriWest and Health Net  officials stated that they processed a large amount of claims from  community providers that had previously been pended or denied because  they lacked medical documentation and, in turn, submitted a large  number of invoices to VA for reimbursement. As previously discussed, to  help address the increased number of TPA invoices, VA issued lump-sum  payments to the TPAs during this time period.", "Modification of timely filing requirement.

VA officials stated that  the waivers were intended to reduce the number of rejected and denied  claims by giving community providers the ability to resubmit previously  rejected or denied claims for which the date of service occurred more  than 180 days ago. VA\u2019s waivers were implemented as follows:  In February 2018, VA issued a waiver that allowed community  providers to resubmit certain claims rejected or denied for specific  reasons when the provider or TPA could verify that the provider made  an effort to submit the claim prior to the claims submission deadline.", "In May 2018, VA issued a second waiver that removed the 180 day  timeliness requirement for all Choice Program claims. The waiver also  provided instructions to the TPAs on informing providers that they  may resubmit claims rejected or denied for specific reasons and how  the TPAs are to process the resubmitted claims.", "In regards to the first waiver, TPA officials stated that the processing of  those resubmitted claims adversely affected the timeliness of the TPAs\u2019  payments to community providers because the waiver resulted in a large  influx of older claims. As the second waiver was in the process of being  implemented by the two TPAs at the time we conducted our work, we  were unable to determine if the second waiver affected the TPAs\u2019  provider payment timeliness.", "Changes to authorization of care requirement. VA issued a contract  modification in January 2017 to expand the time period for which  authorizations for community providers to provide care to veterans under  the Choice Program are valid.  In addition, in May 2017, VA expanded  the scope of the services covered by authorizations, allowing them to  encompass an overall course of treatment, rather than a specific service  or set of services. According to VA officials, the changes VA made  related to the authorization of care requirement were also intended to  reduce the need for secondary authorization requests (SAR). Community  providers request SARs when veterans need health care services that  exceed the period or scope of the original authorizations. Community  providers are required to submit SARs to their TPA, which, in turn,  submits the SARs to the authorizing VA medical facility for review and  approval. Both Health Net and TriWest officials told us that since VA  changed the time frame and scope of authorizations, the number of SARs  has decreased.", "Despite efforts to decrease the number of SARs, payment delays or claim  denials are likely to continue if SARs are needed. We found that VA is not  ensuring that VA medical facilities are reviewing and approving SARs  within required time frames. VA policy states that VA medical facilities are  to review and make SAR approval decisions within 5 business days of  receipt. However, officials from one of the TPAs and 7 of the 15  providers we interviewed stated that VA medical facilities are not  reviewing and approving SARs in a timely manner. According to TriWest  officials, as of May 2018, VA medical facilities in their regions were taking  an average of 11 days to review and make approval decisions on SARs,  with four facilities taking over 30 days for this process.", "According to an official from VA\u2019s Office of Community Care, VA does not  currently collect reliable national data to track the extent of nonadherence  to the VA policy to review and make SAR approval decisions within 5  business days. The official told us that instead, VA relies on employees  assigned to each Veterans Integrated Service Network to monitor data on  VA medical facilities\u2019 timeliness in making these SAR approval  decisions. If a VA medical facility is found not to be in adherence with  the SAR policy, the official told us that staff assigned to the Veterans  Integrated Service Network attempt to identify the reasons for  nonadherence, and perform certain corrective actions, including providing  education to the facility. Despite these actions, the official told us that  there are still VA medical facilities not in adherence with VA\u2019s SAR  approval policy.", "According to a VA official, VA is in the process of piloting software for  managing authorizations that will allow VA to better track SAR approval  time frames across VA medical facilities in the future. However, even after  this planned software is implemented, if VA does not use the data to  monitor and assess SAR approval decision time frames VA will be unable  to ensure that all VA medical facilities are adhering to the policy.  Standards for internal control in the Federal Government state that  management should establish and operate monitoring activities to  evaluate whether a specific function or process is operating effectively  and take corrective actions as necessary. Furthermore, monitoring such  data will allow VA to identify and take actions as needed to address any  identified challenges VA medical facilities are encountering in meeting the  required approval decision time frames. Without monitoring data to  ensure that all VA medical facilities are adhering to the SAR approval  time frames as outlined in VA policy, community providers may delay care  until the SARs are approved or provide care without SAR approval. This  in turn increases the likelihood that the community providers\u2019 claims will  be denied. Further, continued nonadherence to VA\u2019s SAR policy raises  concerns about VA\u2019s ability to ensure timely approval of SARs when VA  medical facilities assume more responsibilities for ensuring veterans\u2019  access to care under the forthcoming Veterans Community Care  Program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TPAs Have Taken Steps to Improve Provider Education to Help Providers Resolve Claims Processing Issues, but Many Providers Still Report Poor Customer Service", "paragraphs": ["We found that VA and its TPAs have taken steps to educate community  providers in order to help prevent claims processing issues that have  contributed to the length of time TPAs have taken to pay these providers.  Despite these efforts, 9 of the 15 providers we interviewed reported poor  customer service when attempting to resolve claims payment issues.", "While VA\u2019s contracts with the TPAs do not include requirements for  educating and training providers on the Choice Program, both TPAs have  taken steps to educate community providers on how to successfully  submit claims under the Choice Program. Specifically, TriWest and  Health Net officials told us that they have taken various steps to educate  community providers on submitting claims correctly, including sending  monthly newsletters, emails, and faxes to communicate changes to the  Choice Program; updating their websites with claims processing  information; and holding meetings with some providers monthly or  quarterly to resolve claims processing issues. Officials from both TPAs  also told us that they provided one-on-one training to some providers on  the claims submission process to help reduce errors when submitting  claims. In addition, VA\u2019s RFP for the Veterans Community Care Program  contracts includes requirements to provide an annual training program  curriculum and an initial on-boarding and ongoing outreach and education  program for community providers, which includes training on the claims  submission and payment processes and TPA points of contact.", "VA and the TPAs have also made efforts to help providers resolve claims  processing issues and outstanding payments. For example,", "VA launched its \u201ctop 20 provider initiative\u201d in January 2018 to work  directly with community providers with high dollar amounts of unpaid  claims and resolve ongoing claims payment issues. This initiative  included creating rapid response teams to work with community  providers to settle unpaid claim balances within 90 days and working  with both TPAs to increase the number of clean claims paid in less  than 30 days. In addition, VA has developed webinars on VA\u2019s  community care programs and\u2014in conjunction with trade  organizations and health care systems\u2014has delivered provider  education on filing claims properly.", "TriWest officials stated that it has educated the customer service staff  at its claims processing sub-contractor, who field community provider  calls regarding claims processing issues, to help ensure that the staff  are familiar with Choice Program changes and can effectively assist  community providers and resolve claims processing issues. Internal  TriWest data show that providers\u2019 average wait time to speak to a  customer service representative about claims processing issues  decreased from as high as 18 minutes in 2016 to as low as 2.5  minutes in 2018.", "Health Net officials were unable to provide data, but stated that since  the fourth quarter of 2017, Health Net has decreased the time it takes  for a community provider to speak with a customer service  representative by adding additional staff and extending the hours in  which providers can call with questions. In addition, Health Net  officials stated that they have required customer service staff to  undergo additional training related to resolving claims processing  issues.", "Despite these efforts, 7 of the 10 providers that participate in the Health  Net network and 2 of the 7 providers that participate in the TriWest  network we interviewed between April and June 2018 told us that when  they contact the TPAs\u2019 customer service staff to address claim processing  questions, such as how to resolve claim rejections or denials, they  experience lengthy hold times, sometimes exceeding one hour. In  addition, 7 of the 15 providers we spoke with told us they typically reach  employees who are unable to answer their questions. According to these  providers, this experience frustrated them, as they often did not  understand why a claim had been denied or rejected, and they required  assistance correcting the claim so it could be resubmitted. One  community provider stated that their common practice to resolve  questions or concerns was to call customer service enough times until  they received the same answer twice from a TPA representative. In  addition, 5 of the 10 Health Net providers we interviewed stated that they  have significant outstanding claim balances owed to them. One of these  providers\u2014who reported over $3 million in outstanding claims\u2014stressed  the importance of being able to effectively resolve claims issues with TPA  customer service staff, as the administrative burden of following up on  outstanding claim balances takes time away from caring for patients.", "The issues concerning customer service wait times and TPA staff inability  to resolve some claims processing issues reported by community  providers appear to be inconsistent with VA contractual requirements.", "VA\u2019s current Choice Program contracts require the TPAs to establish a  customer call center to respond to calls from veterans and non-VA  providers. The contract requires specified levels of service for telephone  inquiries at the call center. For example, VA requires TPA representatives  to answer customer service calls within an average speed of 30 seconds  or less and requires 85 percent of all inquiries to be fully and completely  answered during the initial telephone call. However, VA officials explained  that VA does not enforce the contractual requirement for responding to  calls from community providers. Furthermore, according to these officials,  VA allows the TPAs to prioritize calls from veterans. Officials from VA\u2019s  Office of General Counsel, Procurement Law Group, confirmed that this  requirement does apply to the TPAs\u2019 handling of calls from community  providers. Because VA does not enforce the customer service  requirement for providers, VA has not collected data on or monitored the  TPAs\u2019 compliance with these requirements for providers\u2019 calls.", "As previously stated, standards for internal control in the Federal  Government state that management should establish and operate  monitoring activities to evaluate whether a specific function or process is  operating effectively and take corrective actions as necessary. Without  collecting data and monitoring customer service requirements for provider  calls, VA does not have information on the extent to which community  providers face challenges when contacting the TPAs about claims  payment issues that could contribute to the amount of time it takes to  successfully file claims and receive reimbursement for services under the  Choice Program. This, in turn, poses a risk to the Choice Program to the  extent that community providers who face these challenges decide not to  serve veterans under the Choice Program.", "Looking forward, VA has included customer service requirements in its  RFP for the Veterans Community Care Program contracts, and VA  officials have told us that these requirements are applicable to provider  calls. For example, the RFP includes a requirement for its future TPAs to  establish and maintain call centers to address inquiries from community  providers and has established customer service performance metrics to  monitor call center performance.  Monitoring data on provider calls under  the contracts will be important as Veterans Community Care Program  TPAs will continue to be responsible for building provider networks,  processing claims, and resolving claims processing issues."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Choice Program relies on community providers to deliver care to  eligible veterans when VA is unable to provide timely and accessible care  at its own facilities. Although VA has taken steps to improve the  timeliness of TPA claim payments to providers, VA is not collecting data  or monitoring compliance with two Choice Program requirements, and  this could adversely affect the timeliness with which community providers  are paid under the Choice Program. First, VA does not have complete  data allowing it to effectively monitor adherence with its policy for VA  medical facilities to review SARs within 5 days of receipt, which impacts  its ability to meet the requirement. To the extent that VA medical facilities  delay these reviews and approvals, community providers may have to  delay care or deliver care that is not authorized, which in turn increases  the likelihood that the providers\u2019 claims will be denied and the providers  will not be paid. Second, VA requires the TPAs to establish a customer  call center to respond to calls from veterans and non-VA providers.  However, VA does not enforce the contractual requirement for responding  to calls from community providers and allows the TPAs to prioritize calls  from veterans. Consequently, VA is not collecting data, monitoring, or  enforcing compliance with its contractual requirements for the TPAs to  provide timely customer service to providers.
