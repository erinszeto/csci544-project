Most state DOT officials and other relevant transportation officials use local knowledge of grade crossings to supplement the results of models that rank grade crossings based on the risk of an accident. These states generally consider the same primary risk factors, such as vehicle and train traffic. FRA is taking steps to improve the data used in its model to help states assess risk factors at grade crossings. For example, FRA's grade-crossing inspectors will review and identify issues with railroad- and state-reported inventory data. FRA is currently developing guidelines, which it plans to finalize by the end of 2018, to implement these inspections as it has for other types of FRA inspections.", "Officials we spoke with in eight states reported challenges in pursuing certain types of projects that could further enhance safety, in part because of federal requirements. While safety has improved, many crashes occur at grade crossings with gates, and officials said there could be additional ways to focus program requirements to continue improving safety. States' and the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) reporting focuses on the program's funding and activity, such as the number and types of projects, yet the low number of crashes makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of projects in reducing crashes and fatalities. FHWA reports the program has been effective in reducing fatalities by about 74 percent since 1975. However, since 2009, annually there have been about 250 fatalities\u2014almost one percent of total highway fatalities. FRA expects future crashes to grow, in part, due to the anticipated increase in rail and highway traffic. An evaluation of the program should consider whether its funding and other requirements allow states to adequately address ongoing safety issues. FHWA officials said they are not required to perform such evaluations.

For example, FRA sponsored an in- depth data analysis of grade-crossing crashes to better identify which  crossing characteristics increase the risk of an accident. The report,  issued in 2017, found that the volumes of train and vehicle traffic at a  crossing are the biggest predictors of grade-crossing crashes. Changes  in vehicle and train traffic therefore affect the annual number of grade- crossing crashes. For example, as highway traffic decreased in 2008,  possibly due to the economic recession and higher gas prices, so too did  the number of grade-crossing crashes. As previously noted, FRA expects  that the number of grade-crossing crashes will likely grow with anticipated  increases in future train and highway traffic. As discussed below, vehicle  and train volume are included in the U.S. DOT Accident Prediction Model,  which some states use to select grade-crossing improvement projects.

According to  FRA\u2019s accident data, in 2017, 71 percent of fatal crashes at public grade  crossings occurred at those with gates. In 2004, the DOT Inspector  General (IG) reported that 94 percent of grade-crossing crashes from  1994 to 2003 could be attributed to risky driver behavior or poor  judgement. State officials we spoke with explained that drivers may  become impatient waiting at a grade crossing and decide to go around  the gates. Drivers may also line up over the grade crossing in heavy  vehicular traffic, and be unable to exit before the gates come down. See  figure 3 for examples of risky driver behavior at grade crossings.", "To better understand driver behavior, FRA sponsored a John A. Volpe  National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) study that  recorded and analyzed drivers\u2019 actions as they approached grade  crossings. The researchers found that almost half of drivers were doing  another task, such as eating, and over a third did not look in either  direction while approaching passive grade crossings. We have previously  reported, and many stakeholders we interviewed agreed, that in light of  inappropriate driver behavior, technological solutions alone may not fully  resolve safety issues at grade crossings. In addition, public-education  and law-enforcement efforts can augment the effectiveness of  technological solutions. According to FRA officials, they shared  information on driver education with DOT\u2019s National Highway Traffic  Safety Administration (NHTSA) as NHTSA works more closely with states  on driver education manuals.

For example, in 2016 and 2017, FRA\u2019s Grade  Crossing Task Force worked with the Volpe Center and the City of  Orlando to test whether photo enforcement at grade crossings could  reduce risky driver behavior. The City of Orlando installed automated  photo-enforcement devices at a grade crossing, and instead of issuing  fines to drivers who had violated its warning devices, sent drivers a  warning notice and educational safety materials. Eight months after the  photo-enforcement system was installed, grade crossing violations  decreased by 15 percent. While FRA judged these enforcement efforts  successful at changing driver behavior, a 2015 FRA whitepaper noted  that photo enforcement equipment is costly\u2014on average costing over  $300,000 per crossing to install and operate for 2 years\u2014and may not be  cost-effective for most grade crossings. FRA found that due to costs  and state laws prohibiting photo-enforcement, only two photo- enforcement cameras were currently in operation at grade crossings  across the country.", "States, localities, and FHWA are also exploring whether new types of  pavement markings at grade crossings can improve driver behavior.   According to DOT officials, FHWA is working with two states to develop  new cross-hatch pavement markings for grade crossings that would  comply with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, similar to the  \u201cdon\u2019t block the box\u201d type pavement markings used in intersections.  FHWA also worked with a city to test the use of in-roadway lights to  delineate the crossing.

Grade-crossing accidents  involving pedestrians are less frequent than those involving automobiles  at grade crossings but have a higher fatality rate. While pedestrians were  involved in only 9 percent of accidents at public crossings in 2017, almost  40 percent of fatal grade-crossing accidents involved pedestrians. To try  to improve pedestrian safety, in 2012 the Volpe Center worked with New  Jersey Transit to study whether adding additional pedestrian gate skirts\u2014 hanging gates that further block a crossing (see fig. 5)\u2014would prevent  people from ducking under the gates. The Volpe Center reported that  these new gates had mixed success. While incidents of people going  under and around the gates decreased, more people chose to cross the  tracks in the street rather than at the sidewalk.", "Finally, FRA is exploring new automated and connected vehicle  technologies that could reduce risky driver behavior at grade crossings.  FRA, FHWA, and officials from one state we interviewed said they  anticipate that such technology will be critical to further improving safety.  Specifically, FRA and FHWA are coordinating with DOT\u2019s Intelligent  Transportation Systems Joint Program Office to develop pilot technology  that would enable crossing infrastructure or trains to communicate  wirelessly with vehicles. Vehicles can use this information to warn the  driver that a crash or violation is imminent, or integrate with onboard  active safety systems. According to FRA officials, they completed a proof  of concept in 2013 and completed and tested a prototype of the  technology in 2017. DOT officials said that DOT does not have a time  frame for when automakers might begin incorporating such connected  vehicle technologies and noted that retrofitting older cars with new  equipment will likely make this a long-term effort.", "FRA shares information on its research in various ways with state DOTs,  because states are responsible for deciding which safety measures to  install at grade crossings. Specifically, FRA and FHWA jointly hold  quarterly webinars with stakeholders, including state DOT officials, and  conduct presentations at highway-rail safety workshops. Information on  safety measures such as grade-crossing devices, signs, and markings  are also included in the Railroad-Highway Grade Crossing Handbook.

However, our analysis of FRA\u2019s crossing inventory found that 4 percent of  grade crossings were last updated in 2009 or earlier. In addition, because  MAP-21 repealed DOT\u2019s authority to issue regulations that would govern  state reporting to the inventory, state reporting of grade-crossing data  remains voluntary, according to FRA officials, and all state-reported  information is not complete. Our analysis of state-reported data in FRA\u2019s  crossing inventory found varying levels of completeness. For example,  while some state-reported data fields were almost entirely complete, 33  percent of public grade crossings were missing data on posted highway  speed. We also found that of the crossings for which states reported the  year when the highway-traffic count was conducted, 64 percent of the  highway-traffic counts for public grade crossings, another important risk  factor, had not been updated since 2009, or earlier. According to the 2015  final rule, FRA will continue to evaluate whether additional regulations to  address state reporting are needed to maintain the crossing inventory\u2019s  accuracy.", "FRA officials told us that improving inventory data will help them better  deploy their limited resources, particularly their grade-crossing inspectors,  and said that they have taken steps to help improve the data. In 2017,  FRA regional officials conducted field reviews to verify the latitude and  longitude data for grade crossings in the inventory, data that states are  responsible for updating. In addition, FRA expects its grade-crossing  inspectors as part of their inspections to review and identify issues with  the railroad- and state-reported inventory data. According to FRA officials,  FRA has begun to both transition its 19 grade-crossing managers into  grade-crossing inspectors and also hire new inspectors, for an eventual  total of 24 inspectors and eight regional specialists to supervise their  activities.", "To help ensure railroads\u2019 compliance with crossing inventory regulations,  officials said that the inspectors will use spot checks to validate the  inventory data by comparing grade-crossing characteristics in the field  with the information railroads submitted to the inventory. In addition, FRA  has incorporated information on inventory-reporting requirements into the  grade-crossing inspectors\u2019 training. Finally, FRA is currently developing  guidelines for the grade-crossing inspections similar to those for other  FRA safety disciplines. FRA headquarters officials acknowledged that  they are still clarifying the details for the inspections that will be included  in the compliance manuals that inspectors will use. Specifically, they  said they are still determining appropriate inspector workloads and  drafting specific guidelines that will need to be integrated into FRA\u2019s  regional inspection plans.", "FRA officials said they are working to develop and make available  inventory inspection guidance to the grade-crossing managers and  inspectors by December 31, 2018. In the meantime, FRA held training  that included information on inventory-reporting requirements. In August  2018, FRA developed guidance for grade-crossing inspections specific to  quiet zones in response to a recommendation we made in 2017. It is  important that FRA meets its goal to issue similar guidance specific to  reviewing the accuracy of the inventory data, as FRA cannot have  reasonable assurance that inspections that are already under way are  being conducted in such a manner that would allow them to consistently  identify data reliability issues at each crossing."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "States Reported Challenges Implementing Certain Project Types and Measuring Projects\u2019 Effectiveness, and FHWA\u2019s Efforts to Assess the Program\u2019s Effectiveness Have Limitations", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Program\u2019s Requirements and Other Challenges Cited by States Contribute to the Selection of Active- Warning Equipment Projects over Other Projects", "paragraphs": ["About 75 percent of all Section 130 Program projects states implemented  in fiscal year 2016 involved installing or updating active grade-crossing  equipment, including warning lights and protective gates (see fig. 6).  The prevalence of this type of project is in part due to the Section 130  Program requirement that states spend at least 50 percent of funds on  protective devices. Other than eliminating a grade crossing, adding  protective devices has long been considered the most effective way of  reducing the risk of a crash.", "Officials from six of eight state DOTs we interviewed told us that the  numbers and types of grade-crossing projects they implement are  dependent on the amount of Section 130 Program funding they receive  and the cost of the projects. As previously described, funds are set aside  from the Highway Safety Improvement Program and distributed to states  by a statutory formula that includes factors such as the number of grade  crossings in each state. Officials from six of the eight state DOTs we  spoke to agreed that the set-aside nature of the program was crucial in  allowing them to implement projects, many of which they said would not  have been possible without Section 130 Program funds. For example,  many said the formula funding ensures that grade-crossing projects are  completed along with highway safety projects, particularly given the fact  that fatalities resulting from grade-crossing crashes account for so few  when compared to highway deaths. Overall, fatalities resulting from  grade-crossing crashes account for less than 1 percent of all highway- related fatalities.", "In fiscal year 2018, the funds distributed ranged from a low of  approximately $1.2 million for eight states and Washington, D.C., to over  $16 million for California and over $19 million for Texas. The number of  grade crossings in the eight states and Washington, D.C. ranged from 5  to 380, while California had almost 6,000 and Texas had over 9,000.  Project implementation costs varied by project type and ranged widely  depending on project scope. Based on 2016 DOT data, some typical  project costs ranged as follows: adding signs to passive grade crossings\u2014$500 to $1,500; adding flashing lights and two gates to passive grade crossings\u2014 $150,000 to $300,000; adding four gates to grade crossings with flashing lights\u2014$250,000 -  closing a grade crossing\u2014$25,000 to $100,000; and  separating a grade crossing from traffic (Grade Separation)\u2014$5  million to $40 million.", "State officials we spoke with cited several challenges in pursuing certain  types of controversial, innovative, and expensive projects that could help  them address the evolving nature of risk at grade crossings and difficulty  in measuring the effectiveness of their projects. First, most state DOT  officials said that the cost of grade-separation projects and, at times, the  controversy of eliminating grade crossings through closure reduces the  number of these projects, while acknowledging that they are the most  effective ways to improve safety. These types of projects made up only 3  percent of Section 130 Program projects in fiscal year 2016 (see fig. 6).  Grade-separation projects are often more expensive than the annual  Section 130 Program funding available to states. In 2018, only eight  states received annual Section 130 Program funding sufficient to fund a  $7-million grade-separation project. As discussed previously, to fund  relatively expensive projects, states may choose to combine funds from  multiple years. Also, states and railroads may make incentive payments  to localities for the permanent closure of a grade crossing. In addition to  the cost, most state DOT officials reported challenges obtaining local  support for closing grade crossings. They said closures may  inconvenience residents who use the road and force emergency  responders to take longer routes, potentially slowing response times.  Grade-separation projects address these safety concerns and may be  more agreeable to residents, but they are substantially more expensive.  While up to $7,500 in Section 130 Program funding can be used to help  incentivize communities to close grade crossings, officials from some of  our selected state DOTs said this amount is generally not enough to  persuade local officials to support the closing.", "Second, officials from many state DOTs we interviewed also reported that  the requirements of the Section 130 Program create challenges for them  in implementing what they considered to be innovative projects. For  example, the program requirement that 50 percent of funds be used on  protective devices, combined with what one researcher described to us  as the tendency by states to implement \u201cknown\u201d projects\u2014i.e., protective  devices\u2014may impede states\u2019 selection of new, more innovative safety  projects. Officials we interviewed from many state DOTs described  challenges related to the program\u2019s requirements. They noted that they  are prevented from using Section 130 Program funds for new types of  safety technologies not yet incorporated into FHWA\u2019s Manual on Uniform  Traffic Control Devices. As noted previously in this report, outside the  Section 130 Program FHWA is working with states and localities to  explore whether new types of pavement markings at grade crossings, not  in the manual, can improve driver behavior. One state DOT official we  interviewed suggested changes to allow states to fund one grade- crossing pilot project per year or to use a set percentage of program  funds to finance a pilot project that could help them explore promising but  as yet unproven technologies.", "Third, state DOT officials from four of the eight selected states also said it  can be difficult to find funding for the required 10 percent state match. As  previously mentioned, while certain rail-safety projects are eligible for up  to 100 percent federal funding, Section 130 Program projects are funded  at a 90 percent federal share. According to DOT documentation we  reviewed, only some states have a dedicated source for such a match,  and state DOT officials from one of our selected states said their state  cannot use state funds for the 10 percent match. Some state DOT  officials said this situation can drive project selection. For example, they  sometimes chose projects based on which localities or railroads were  willing to provide matching funds or offer cost savings.", "Finally, many state officials cited challenges in measuring the  effectiveness of grade crossing projects in reducing crashes or the risk of  crashes. In particular, state officials we spoke to said it can be difficult to  use before-and-after crash statistics as a measure of effectiveness  because of the low number and random nature of crashes. Also, as FRA  research has shown and as FHWA and FRA have noted, reporting on  before-and-after grade-crossing accident statistics can be misleading,  given the infrequency of crashes and crashes that are not the result of  grade crossing conditions. States\u2019 required Section 130 Program annual  progress reports to the Secretary of DOT call for states to report on the  effectiveness of the improvements they made. FHWA reporting  guidance suggests they define effectiveness as the reduction in the  number of fatalities and serious injuries after grade-crossing projects  were implemented, consistent with statutory requirements. In addition,  FHWA guidance states that consideration should be given to quantifying  effectiveness in the context of fatalities and serious injuries. However,  states often report no differences in crashes after specific projects were  implemented, and there have been instances where states reported a slight increase in crashes. Such an increase does not necessarily mean  that the project was not effective in reducing the overall risk of a crash.  Also, not all projects are implemented at grade crossings where there has  been a crash.", "Among other information, states also typically report information on  funding and data on the numbers and types of projects implemented. In  addition, the extent to which states report projects\u2019 effectiveness varies  greatly. Given states\u2019 responsibility for implementing the Section 130  Program and the differences in the amounts of funding they receive,  FHWA officials said states should determine and report on the  appropriate effectiveness metrics for their programs. According to FHWA  officials, during the 2017 reporting year, a few states requested examples  of what to include when reporting effectiveness, and FHWA responded  with examples of various methods they could use, such as a benefit-cost  ratio or the percentage decrease in fatalities, serious injuries, and  crashes. Regardless of the difficulty in measuring the effectiveness of  specific projects, most state DOT officials we interviewed stressed the  importance of the Section 130 Program in funding grade-crossing  projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHWA Reports Provide Limited Insight into the Program\u2019s Effectiveness, and FHWA Has Not Evaluated Program Requirements in Light of Changing Risk Conditions", "paragraphs": ["FHWA\u2019s biennial report to Congress is intended to provide information to  Congress on the progress being made by the states in implementing  projects to improve safety and, in addition, make recommendations for  future implementation of the program. FHWA reviews states\u2019 annual  Section 130 Program reports and uses them to formulate the report to  Congress every 2 years. FHWA\u2019s 2018 report highlights that the Section  130 Program has seen great success since 1975, with a decrease of  approximately 74 percent in fatalities at the same time that there was an  increase in vehicle and train traffic. The report described the latest  available 10-year trend, from 2007 to 2016, as showing a 31 percent  decrease in fatalities. Fatalities have also decreased when adjusted for  train traffic. However, FHWA officials acknowledged in interviews with us  that crashes and fatalities have remained constant since about 2009, with  more recent data showing a slight increase in fatalities over the last 2 to 3  years, data that are consistent with the increases in overall roadway  fatalities. The officials said increased train- and vehicle-traffic volumes  could be contributing to that increase, in addition to other factors, such as  more bicycle riders and pedestrians using grade crossings. As described  earlier, states have generally already used Section 130 Program funding  to address safety at the riskiest grade crossings by adding protective  measures, typically lights and gates. Yet crashes continue to occur at  these improved grade crossings. Given these trends and the challenges  discussed earlier related to the requirements of the Section 130 Program,  it is not clear whether the program remains effective in continuing to  reduce the risk of crashes and fatalities at grade crossings.", "As required, FHWA\u2019s biennial report includes a section on  \u201crecommendations for future implementation\u201d of the Section 130 Program.  As part of this, FHWA reports on challenges and actions being taken to  address them. FHWA\u2019s 2018 report identified one of the same challenges  we heard about from state DOT officials related to the inability or  unwillingness of local agencies to provide matching funds and the  relatively low amount of funding designed to incentivize localities to close  crossings. FHWA reported on its efforts to address these challenges,  including by providing guidance, resources, and supportive training to  states and local agencies and serving as a clearinghouse for innovative  methods of supporting projects. However, with the exception of the  funding challenge, FHWA\u2019s most recent report does not include the other  challenges state officials identified to us related to the requirements of the  Section 130 Program discussed above. These include program funding  requirements that may impede innovative approaches and the difficulties  of using before-and-after crash statistics to measure effectiveness.", "Many state DOT officials we spoke with said there may be an opportunity  to more broadly assess the Section 130 Program at the national level. It  could be more informative to comprehensively assess more detailed  crash trends, such as those that look forward over multiple years across  the more than 1,700 crashes nationwide, rather than on the  approximately 35 that occur on average within a state, and identify  strategies to address those trends. Doing so could help FHWA learn more  about why crashes are continuing and what types of projects may be  effective. There could be ways to evaluate the program in a more  comprehensive way; many state DOT officials we interviewed told us  such a comprehensive evaluation could help improve program  effectiveness in a number of ways, including by enabling the program to  better keep up with the rapid pace of technological change and re- examining eligibility requirements that limit the flexibility of states to  consider other types of projects beyond engineering. Also, most state  DOT officials we interviewed agreed that education and enforcement  efforts are crucial to further improving safety, as did 8 out of 10 other  stakeholders we spoke to, as well as officials from Volpe Center and  NTSB. However, according to FHWA officials, those project types are not  allowed under the Section 130 Program\u2019s requirements. The officials said  FHWA has partnered with FRA and NHTSA on research efforts, such as  driver-behavior studies, to inform grade-crossing safety issues. However,  the officials said that FHWA has not conducted a program evaluation of  the Section 130 Program to consider whether the program\u2019s funding and  other requirements allow states to adequately address ongoing safety  issues such as driver behavior. FHWA officials said that there is no  federal requirement for them to conduct such a program evaluation.", "We have previously reported that an important component of effective  program management is through program performance assessment,  which helps establish a program\u2019s effectiveness\u2014the extent to which a  program is operating as it was intended and the extent to which a  program achieves what the agency proposes to accomplish. This type  of evaluative information helps the executive branch and congressional  committees make decisions about the programs they oversee. Assessing  program performance includes conducting program evaluations, which  are individual systematic studies that answer specific questions about  how well a program is meeting its objectives. In addition, federal  internal-control standards state that management should identify,  analyze, and respond to significant changes in a program\u2019s environment  that could pose new risks.", "FHWA officials said the fact that crashes and fatalities have held steady  while the volume of train and vehicle traffic has increased is an indication  that grade-crossing safety has continued to improve. However, specific to  fatalities per million train-miles, FHWA\u2019s 2018 biennial report shows this  rate to be fairly constant since 2009. As noted previously, FRA expects  train and traffic volumes to continue to increase and has expressed  concern that grade-crossing crashes and fatalities may also increase.   Without conducting a program evaluation, FHWA cannot ensure that the  Section 130 Program is achieving one of the national goals of the federal- aid highway program, to reduce fatalities and injuries. In addition, It is  difficult to see how FHWA, in its biennial reports to Congress, could make  informed recommendations for future program implementation without  conducting a program evaluation to assess, among other things, whether  program requirements first established some four decades ago continue  to reduce fatalities and injuries. We note that as part of a program  evaluation, some changes that FHWA, working with FRA, identifies as  potentially having merit to improve the program\u2019s effectiveness could  require a statutory change."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The continued number of crashes and fatalities at grade crossings with  devices intended to warn of a train\u2019s presence calls into question whether  the Section 130 Program is structured to help states continue making  progress toward the national goal to reduce fatalities and injuries.

The scope of this work  focused on the nation\u2019s more than 128,000 public grade crossings. We  did not include private grade crossings, as states can only use Railway- Highway Crossings Program (commonly referred to as the Section 130  Program) funds to improve safety at public grade crossings.

Specifically, we selected four states from those in the top 25 percent of all  states in terms of their number of grade crossings and the amount of  Section 130 Program funds they received. We selected the other four  states to include a mix of these factors. We also considered geographical  diversity and recommendations from FRA and FHWA officials. Within  these eight states, we conducted in-depth interviews with FHWA division  staff, FRA regional staff, and state officials. A variety of state agencies  administer the Section 130 Program within their state; the state officials  we spoke with from our eight selected states worked for agencies such as  state departments of transportation, corporation commissions, and public  utility commissions.

As part of this objective, we also assessed the reliability of data  reported for all railroads in FRA\u2019s National Highway-Rail Crossing  Inventory data as of August 31, 2018. For public grade crossings that  were not closed, we examined a selection of fields within the database to  identify the frequency of missing data (see table 1), data anomalies (see  table 2), relational errors, where two related data fields had values that  were incompatible (see table 3), and when the data was last updated (see  table 4). Specifically, we conducted the following electronic tests on the  crossing inventory data to determine if they were within reasonable  ranges, were internally consistent, and appeared complete:  Before conducting our analysis, we filtered the inventory data to only  include open, public, at-grade crossings.
