Credit ratings inform investment decisions by both  institutional investors and broker dealers. According to a current  Puerto Rico official and an expert on Puerto Rico\u2019s economy,  investment grade ratings for Puerto Rico municipal bonds may have  driven demand for these securities in the states. Based on  interviews with ratings agency officials and a review of rating agency  criteria, we found that Puerto Rico may have maintained its  investment grade rating for two reasons. First, Puerto Rico could not  seek debt restructuring under federal bankruptcy laws, prior to the  passage of PROMESA in 2016. According to rating agency officials,  bonds with assumed bankruptcy protection tend to rate higher than  those without such protection. Second, legal frameworks that prioritize  debt service are often viewed as positive for credit ratings, according  to rating agency criteria. In the event that the Puerto Rico government  does not have sufficient resources to meet appropriations for a given  fiscal year, Puerto Rico\u2019s constitution requires that the government  pay interest and amortization on the public debt before disbursing  funds for other purposes in accordance with the order of priorities  established by law.
