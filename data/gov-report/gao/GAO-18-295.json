Officials from all three agencies stated that they consider mission needs and the availability of equipment leases when deciding whether to lease or purchase heavy equipment. Federal regulations provide that agencies should consider whether it is more economical to lease or purchase equipment when acquiring heavy equipment, and federal internal control standards require that management clearly document all transactions in a manner that allows the documentation to be readily available for examination. However, in reviewing selected leases and purchases of heavy equipment from these three agencies, GAO found that officials did not consistently conduct or document lease-versus-purchase analyses. Officials at the Air Force and Interior said that there was a lack of clarity in agency policies about when they were required to conduct and document such analyses. Without greater clarity on when lease-versus-purchase analyses should be conducted and documented, these agencies may not be spending funds on heavy equipment effectively."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["The Department of the Interior and the Air Force should clarify the circumstances in which lease-versus-purchases analyses for heavy equipment acquisitions are to be conducted and documented.

This type of  equipment can cost over $2 million per item. There is no government- wide information on how much heavy equipment agencies own and there  are no requirements for agencies to report on their ownership, use, or  cost of this equipment. This is in part due to the lack of a generally  accepted definition of heavy equipment. As the government continues to  seek opportunities to reduce costs, it is important to understand how  agencies determine the need for heavy equipment and how their methods  may affect the cost of their heavy equipment fleet.", "You asked us to identify data on federally owned heavy equipment and  agencies\u2019 efforts to manage utilization of their heavy equipment. This  report addresses:  the number, type, and cost of heavy equipment items that are owned  by 20 federal agencies;  the heavy equipment items that selected agencies have recently  acquired and how agencies decided whether to purchase or lease this  equipment; and how selected agencies manage the utilization of their heavy  equipment.", "To identify the number, type, and cost of heavy equipment owned by  federal agencies, we first developed a definition of heavy equipment for  the purposes of our review. Specifically, we identified 12 federal supply  classes in which the majority of items are self-propelled equipment and  include items such as backhoes, cranes, excavators, tractors, and  warehouse trucks. The selected federal supply classes do not include  classes specific to passenger vehicles and combat and tactical items, as  these items are generally not considered to be heavy equipment. We  validated our selection of federal supply classes with agency officials we  interviewed, who agreed that the selected classes are generally  considered to be heavy equipment. We then contacted the personal  property managers at each of the 24 agencies covered by the Chief  Financial Officers Act (CFO Act) and requested data on each agency\u2019s  heavy equipment inventory. We received inventory data from 20 of the  24 agencies either at the department level or from different components  within the agency, depending on how the data were maintained. Officials  at four agencies\u2014the Department of Education, the Department of the  Treasury, the General Services Administration (GSA), and the Small  Business Administration\u2014indicated that the agency does not own heavy  equipment. We did not verify the data or responses received, but did  review the data for inconsistencies and removed outliers; the results of  our data collection effort are used only for descriptive purposes and are  not generalizable beyond the 24 CFO Act agencies. We found these data  to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes. For a complete list of agencies  that responded to our data collection effort, as well as information on  whether they reported at the departmental level, see appendix I.", "To determine the heavy equipment items that selected agencies recently  acquired and how these agencies decided whether to purchase or lease  this equipment, we identified agencies that reported the highest  obligations for construction and/or heavy equipment in Federal  Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG). We then  identified additional factors such as spending on leases and a mix of  civilian and military departments. Through this process, we selected the  departments of Defense and the Interior for further review. Working with  department officials, we selected three agencies within those two  departments that had the highest number of heavy equipment items  based on their inventory data, among other criteria: the U.S. Air Force (Air  Force), the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and the National Park  Service (NPS). For each agency, we used data from our data collection  effort to determine what heavy equipment the agency had purchased in  calendar years 2012 through 2016 and requested data on heavy  equipment leased in fiscal years 2012 through 2016. We obtained and  reviewed these three selected agencies\u2019 guidance documents on  acquiring heavy equipment and reviewed eight heavy equipment  acquisitions from the three selected agencies to determine if the  acquisitions followed relevant guidance and Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government. To select these acquisitions, we randomly  selected two purchases each from the Air Force, NPS, and FWS as well  as two leases each from the Air Force and FWS, for a total of ten  acquisitions. During our review, Interior identified guidance from 2013 on  lease-versus-purchase analysis. We excluded one FWS lease and one  NPS purchase from our analysis because they occurred prior to the  issuance of this guidance. As a result, we reviewed a total of eight  acquisitions. Any findings from our review of the selected agencies and  analysis of these procurement decisions are not generalizable within each  department or across the federal government.

According to FWS officials, condition  assessments inform regional-level decision making about whether to  move equipment to another FWS location or dispose of the equipment.", "In contrast, NPS does not require the collection of utilization data to  evaluate heavy equipment use and does not have guidance for managing  heavy equipment utilization. However, NPS officials told us that they  recognize the need for such guidance. NPS officials shared with us draft  guidance that they have developed, which would require collection of  utilization data for heavy equipment such as hours or days of usage each  month. According to NPS officials, they plan to send the guidance to the  NPS policy office for final review in March 2018. Until this guidance is  completed and published, NPS is taking interim actions to manage the  utilization of its heavy equipment. For example, NPS officials stated that  they have asked NPS locations to collect and post monthly utilization  data, discussed the collection of utilization data at fleet meetings, and  distributed job aids to support this effort. During the course of our review,  NPS officials provided us with some utilization data for about 1,400 of the  more than 2,400 NPS heavy equipment items. Specifically, for the 1,459  heavy equipment items for which NPS provided utilization data, 541 items  had utilization data for each month. For the remaining 918 items,  utilization data were reported for some, but not all months."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has spent billions of dollars to acquire heavy  equipment.

We then obtained and analyzed data on  agencies\u2019 spending on equipment purchases and leases from the Federal  Procurement Data System\u2013Next Generation (FPDS-NG), which contains  government-wide data on agencies\u2019 contracts. However, in reviewing the  data available and identifying issues with the reliability of the data, we  determined that data on contracts would not be sufficient to answer the  question of what heavy equipment the 24 CFO Act agencies own. We  therefore conducted a data collection effort to obtain heavy equipment  inventory information from the 24 CFO Act agencies, which are the  Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy,  Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban  Development, the Interior, Justice, Labor, State, Transportation, the  Treasury, and Veterans Affairs; Environmental Protection Agency;  General Services Administration; National Aeronautics and Space  Administration; National Science Foundation; Nuclear Regulatory  Commission; Office of Personnel Management; Small Business  Administration; Social Security Administration; and Agency for  International Development.", "Because there is no generally accepted definition of heavy equipment, we  identified 12 federal supply classes in which the majority of items are self- propelled equipment but not passenger vehicles or items that are specific  to combat and tactical purposes, as these items are generally not  considered to be heavy equipment. (See table 5.) We then vetted the  appropriateness of these selected supply classes with Interior, FWS,  NPS, and Air Force agency officials, as well as with representatives from  a fleet management consultancy and a rental company, and they  generally agreed that items in selected federal supply classes are  considered heavy equipment. Federal supply classes are used in FPDS- NG and are widely used in agencies\u2019 inventory systems. Overall, about 90  percent of the heavy equipment items that agencies reported were  assigned a federal supply class in the agency\u2019s inventory data. In  discussing heavy equipment categories in the report, we use the category  titles below.", "To identify points of contact at the 24 CFO Act agencies, we obtained  GSA\u2019s list of contact information for agencies\u2019 national utilization officers,  who are agency property officers who coordinate with GSA. As a  preliminary step, we contacted these individuals at each of the 24 CFO  Act agencies and asked them to either confirm that they were the  appropriate contacts or provide contact information for the appropriate  contact and to inform us if they do not own heavy equipment. Officials at  4 agencies\u2014Department of Education, Department of the Treasury,  General Services Administration, and Small Business Administration\u2014 indicated that the agency did not own any items in the relevant federal  supply classes. Officials at 16 of these agencies indicated that they would  be able to respond on a departmental level because the relevant  inventory data are maintained centrally, while officials at 4 agencies  indicated that we would need to obtain responses from officials at some  other level because the relevant inventory data are not maintained  centrally. (See table 7 for a list of organizations within the 20 CFO Act  agencies that indicated they own relevant equipment and responded to  our data collection effort.)", "After identifying contacts responsible for agencies\u2019 heavy-equipment  inventory data, we prepared data collection instruments for requesting  information on heavy equipment and tested these documents with  representatives from 4 of the 20 CFO Act agencies that indicated they  own heavy equipment to ensure that the documents were clear and  logical and that respondents would be able to provide the requested data  and answer the questions without undue burden. These agency  representatives were selected to provide a variety of spending on federal  supply group 38 equipment as reported in FPDS-NG, civilian and military  agencies, and different levels at which the agency would be responding to  the data collection effort (e.g., at the departmental level or at a sub- departmental level).", "Our data collection instrument requested the following data on  respondent organizations\u2019 owned assets in 12 federal supply classes as  of June 2017:  Respondents provided data on original acquisition costs in nominal terms,  with some acquisitions occurring over 50 years ago. In order to provide a  fixed point of reference for appropriate comparison, we present in our  report inflation-adjusted acquisition costs using calendar year 2016 as the  reference. To adjust these dollar amounts for inflation, we used the  Bureau of Labor Statistic\u2019s Producer Price Index by Commodity for  Machinery and Equipment: Construction Machinery and Equipment  (WPU112), compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. We  conducted the data collection effort from July 2017 through October 2017  and received responses from all 20 agencies that indicated they own  heavy equipment. In order to assess the reliability of agencies\u2019 reported  data, we collected and reviewed agencies\u2019 responses regarding  descriptions of their inventory systems, frequency of data entry, agency  uses of the data, and agencies\u2019 opinions on potential limitations of the use  of their data in our analysis. We conducted some data cleaning, which  included examining the data for obvious errors and eliminating outliers.  We did not verify the data or responses received; the results of our data  collection effort are used only for descriptive purposes and are not  generalizable beyond the 24 CFO Act agencies. Based on the steps we  took, we found these data to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To determine the heavy equipment items that selected agencies recently  acquired and how these agencies decided whether to purchase or lease  this equipment, we first used data from the FPDS-NG to identify agencies  that appeared to have the highest obligations for construction or heavy  equipment, or both, and used this information, along with other factors, to  select DOD and Interior. At the time, in the absence of a generally  accepted definition of heavy equipment, we reviewed data related to  federal supply group 38\u2014construction, mining, excavating, and highway  maintenance equipment\u2014because (1) we had not yet defined heavy  equipment for the purposes of our review; (2) agency officials had told us  that most of what could be considered heavy equipment was in this  federal supply group; and (3) our analysis of data from usaspending.gov  showed that about 80 percent of spending on items that may be  considered heavy equipment were in this federal supply group. In meeting  with officials at these departments, we learned that agencies within each  department manage heavy equipment independently, so we requested  current inventory data for Interior bureaus and the DOD military  departments and selected three agencies that had among the largest  inventories of construction and/or heavy equipment at the time, among  other criteria: the U.S. Air Force (Air Force); the Fish and Wildlife Service  (FWS); and the National Park Service (NPS). We then used information  from our data collection effort\u2014which included the number, type, cost,  acquisition year and other data elements\u2014to determine heavy equipment  items that these agencies acquired during 2012 through 2016. We  interviewed agency officials to determine what lease data were available  from the three selected agencies. We assessed the reliability of these  data with agency official interviews and reviewed the data for  completeness and potential outliers. We determined that the data  provided were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of documenting leased  and rental heavy equipment. We also obtained data from GSA\u2019s Short- Term Rental program, which had previously been limited to passenger  vehicles, in part program for August 2012, when the first item was rented  under this program, to February 2017, when GSA provided the data. We  used these data to identify selected agencies\u2019 rentals of heavy equipment  through GSA\u2019s Short-Term Rental program, which had previously been  limited to passenger vehicles, in part program and associated costs. We  interviewed officials from GSA\u2019s Short-Term Rental program to discuss  the program history as well as the reliability of their data on these rented  heavy equipment items. We determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes.", "To determine how the three selected agencies decide whether to  purchase or lease heavy equipment, we interviewed fleet and property  managers at these selected agencies and asked them to describe their  process for making these decisions as well as to identify relevant federal  and agency regulations and guidance. We reviewed relevant federal and  agency regulations and guidance regarding how agencies should make  these decisions, including: Federal Acquisition Regulation, Office of  Management Budget\u2019s A-94, Guidelines and Discount Rates for Benefit- Cost Analysis of Federal Programs, Defense Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement, Air Force Manual 65-506, Air Force Guidance  Memorandum to Air Force Instruction 65-501, and Interior\u2019s Guidance On  Lease Versus Purchase Analysis and Capital Lease Determination for  Equipment Leases. We also reviewed the Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government for guidance on documentation as well as  past GAO work that reviewed agencies\u2019 lease-versus-purchase  analyses.", "To determine whether the three selected federal agencies documented  lease-versus-purchase decisions for selected acquisitions and adhered to  relevant agency guidance, we selected and reviewed a non-generalizable  sample of 10 heavy equipment acquisitions\u2014two purchases each from  the Air Force, FWS, and NPS, and two leases each from the Air Force  and FWS. Specifically, we used inventory data obtained through our data  collection effort, described above, to randomly select two heavy  equipment purchases from each selected agency using the following  criteria:  calendar years 2012 through 2016;  the two federal supply classes most prevalent in each selected  agency\u2019s heavy equipment inventory, as determined by the data  collection effort described above; and  for NPS and FWS, acquisition costs of over $15,000.", "In addition, we used lease data provided by the Air Force and FWS to  randomly selected two heavy equipment leases per agency. Because  NPS could not provide data on heavy equipment leases, we did not select  or review any NPS lease decisions. To select the Air Force and FWS  leases we used the following criteria:  fiscal years 2012 through 2016;  for the Air Force, which included federal supply classes in the lease  data provided, the two federal supply classes most prevalent in the  lease data and for FWS, which did not include federal supply class in  the lease data provided, the two federal supply classes most  prevalent in the purchase data; and  for FWS, leases over $15,000.", "After selecting these acquisitions, we determined that one FWS lease and  one NPS purchase we selected pre-dated Interior\u2019s 2013 guidance on  lease-versus-purchase analysis and excluded these acquisitions from our  analysis for a total of eight acquisitions. In reviewing agencies\u2019  documentation related to these acquisitions, we developed a data  collection instrument to assess the extent to which agencies documented  lease-versus-purchase analyses and, in the case of FWS and NPS,  adhered to relevant Interior guidance. We supplemented our review of  these acquisition decisions with additional information by interviewing  officials at the three selected agencies and requesting additional  information to understand specific circumstances surrounding each  procurement. Our findings are not generalizable across the federal  government or within each selected department.", "To determine how selected agencies manage heavy equipment  utilization, we interviewed officials at the three selected agencies to  identify departmental and agency-specific guidance and policies and to  determine whether utilization requirements exist. We reviewed guidance  identified by these officials, including Interior and Air Force vehicle  guidance, both of which apply to heavy equipment, and FWS\u2019s Heavy  Equipment Utilization and Replacement Handbook. We also compared  their practices to relevant Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government. For the selected agencies with guidance for managing  heavy equipment\u2014Air Force and FWS\u2014we reviewed the guidance to  determine if and how selected agencies measured and documented  heavy equipment utilization. For example, we reviewed whether selected  agencies developed reports for managing heavy equipment utilization  such as Air Force validation reports and FWS conditional assessment  reports. We also reviewed Air Force, FWS, and NPS utilization data for  heavy equipment but we did not independently calculate or verify the  utilization rate for individual heavy equipment items because each heavy  equipment item (backhoe, forklift, tractor, etc.,) has different utilization  requirements depending on various factors such as the brand, model, or  age of equipment. However, we did request information about agency  procedures to develop and verify utilization rates. We assessed the  reliability of the utilization data with agency official interviews and a review  of the data for completeness and potential outliers. We determined that  the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of providing evidence  of utilization data collection for heavy equipment assets.", "We also visited the NPS George Washington Memorial Parkway to  interview equipment maintenance officials regarding the procurement and  management of heavy equipment and to document photos of heavy  equipment. We selected this site because of its range of heavy equipment  and close proximity to the Capital region.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2016 to February  2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
