Listing decisions are often characterized as straightforward, and experts, peer reviewers, and others generally support the science behind these decisions. Critical habitat designations, on the other hand, are more complex and often require additional scientific and nonscientific information. As a result, peer reviewers often expressed concern about the specific areas designated, while other experts expressed concerns about the adequacy of the data available to make designations. The Service's critical habitat program has been characterized by frequent litigation. Specifically, the Service has lost a series of legal challenges that will require significant resources for the next 5 fiscal years to respond to court orders and settlement agreements for designating critical habitat. As a result, the Service is unable to focus resources on activities it believes provide more protection to species than designating critical habitat. While the Service recognizes that it has lost control of the program, it has yet to offer a remedy.

For many years, the act, its implementation,  and the Service have served as lightning rods in the ongoing national  debate concerning the tradeoffs between economic, social, and  environmental values.  The act requires the Service to list as endangered  any species facing extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its  range and to list as threatened any species likely to become endangered in  the foreseeable future.  The Service must make decisions to list species  solely on the basis of the best available scientific and commercial data,  such as biological or trade data obtained from commercial publications.   The act also generally requires the Service to designate critical habitat\u2014 habitat essential to a species\u2019 conservation\u2014when listing a species; the  loss of habitat is often the principal cause of species decline.  For critical  habitat decisions, the act again requires the Service to consider the best  available scientific data, but also requires the Service to consider the  economic impact and other relevant impacts of designating particular areas  as critical habitat.  The Service is also required to develop a plan to recover  the listed species to the point that it is no longer threatened or endangered,  an achievement marked by its removal, or delisting, from the list of  threatened or endangered species.", "Recent concerns about the Service\u2019s listing and critical habitat decisions  have focused on the role that \u201csound science\u201d plays in the decision-making  process and whether the Service bases its decisions on adequate scientific  data and properly interprets those data.  Critics of the decisions warn that  improper listing and critical habitat decisions may cause social and  economic disruption and divert funding and attention away from other  species truly facing extinction.  In addition to concerns about its use of  science, the Service is having difficulty managing the listing and critical  habitat programs, in part because of extensive litigation.  Currently, the  Service is experiencing a significant backlog of decisions to list species and  to designate critical habitat.  The Service has identified more than 200  species that qualify for listing but for which the listing process has not yet  begun because of resource limitations or higher-priority actions being  taken for other species.", "You asked us to assess the Service\u2019s consideration and use of science in its  decisions to list species as threatened or endangered and to designate  critical habitat.

In addition, in performing our work,  we identified certain factors that could continue to affect the Service\u2019s  ability to effectively manage its critical habitat program.  Our report  highlights the nature and extent of those problems as well.", "In meeting our objectives, we examined decision documents for the 101  listing and critical habitat decisions that the Service issued during fiscal  years 1999 through 2002. There were 64 listing decisions and 37 critical  habitat decisions covering 108 and 36 species, respectively.  To evaluate the  adequacy of the science used to support these decisions, we reviewed (1)  the Service\u2019s policies, procedures, and practices for making listing and  critical habitat decisions; (2) the responses of peer reviewers who  commented on 79 listing and critical habitat actions; and (3) judicial  decisions related to listing and critical habitat actions decided during fiscal  years 1999 through 2002.  We also interviewed staff at seven field and  regional offices and at Service headquarters to help understand the  Service\u2019s decision-making process.  We interviewed individuals with  academic, industry, and conservation organizations and the National  Academy of Sciences to better understand why some of the Service\u2019s  decisions are controversial.

Available data includes biological or trade data obtained  from scientific or commercial publications, administrative reports, maps or  other graphic materials, or experts on the subject.  Using the best available  data, the act requires the Service to determine whether a species should be  listed as threatened or endangered by analyzing its status based on the  following five factors: present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of a  species habitat or range;  overuse for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational   inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or  other natural or manmade factors affecting a species\u2019 continued  existence.", "As of June 2003, the Service had listed 1,263 species in the United States as  threatened or endangered.  This total included 517 animal species and 746  plant species.  The number of species listed per year has varied  considerably, as shown in figure 1.  There are also 558 foreign species listed  as threatened or endangered.", "As of June 2003, the Service was in the process of listing 36 more species  and had identified 251 species as candidates for listing.  The act also  requires the Service to designate critical habitat for listed species.  Critical  habitat is a specific geographic area that is essential for the conservation of  a threatened or endangered species and that may require special  management and protection.  As of June 2003, 417 domestic species had  critical habitat designated.  The number of critical habitat designations per  year has varied considerably, as shown in figure 2.", "The Endangered Species Act has provisions to protect and recover species  once they are listed.

Also, federal agencies must ensure that their activities, or any  activities they fund, permit, or license, do not jeopardize the continued  existence of a listed species or result in the destruction or adverse  modification of its critical habitat. The act establishes a process for federal  agencies to consult with the Service about their activities that may affect  listed species.  In addition, the act requires that the Service develop a  recovery plan to reverse the decline of each listed species and ensure its  long-term survival.  A recovery plan may include a variety of methods and  procedures to recover listed species, such as protective measures to  prevent extinction or further decline, habitat acquisition and restoration,  and other on-the-ground activities for managing and monitoring  endangered and threatened species.

The act and  regulations require the Service to provide an opportunity for public  participation in the rulemaking process, notify affected states and local  jurisdictions and invite comments from them and other interested parties,  notify newspapers and professional journals, and hold at least one public  hearing, if requested, within 45 days of publishing the proposal.   Additionally, Service procedures provide for listing and critical habitat  decisions to be reviewed internally to help ensure that the professional  judgment that the Service\u2019s scientists exercise when weighing and  interpreting the collected data is sound and conforms to contemporary  scientific theories and principles.", "The process to list a species begins either through a petition from an  individual, group, or state agency or through the initiative of the Service  (see fig. 3).", "When a petition is filed to list a species, the Service provides a copy of the  petition to, and requests information from, appropriate state agencies and  affected tribal governments.  The Service uses the information that it  receives from these parties (or that which is contained in the petition or  otherwise readily available) to make its initial determination as to whether  a species may be threatened or endangered, and if so, to proceed with data  gathering and analysis.  The act requires the Service to make this  determination generally within 90 days of receiving the petition.  If the  Service determines that it should proceed, it conducts a \u201cstatus review\u201d\u2014a  review of all the available information on a species\u2014to determine whether  the species warrants protection under the act.  To conduct the status  review, the Service solicits comments and requests information from the  general public (by publishing a notice in the Federal Register) and contacts  affected local, state, tribal and federal agencies; interested conservation or  industry groups; and scientific organizations or professionals interested in  and/or knowledgeable about the species.  The Service may also fund field  surveys, museum research, and literature searches in order to compile  available information.  Service scientists who conduct status reviews told  us that they often work closely with experts from other government  agencies, academia, and elsewhere to help gather and interpret  information.  In some instances, the Service initiates a review of a species  without a petition, for which it conducts a candidate assessment\u2014similar  to a status review\u2014to identify available information.", "Within 12 months of receiving a petition for which the Service proceeded  with a status review, the Service must determine whether the species\u2019  listing is warranted.  If a Service field office makes an initial determination  that the listing is warranted, it prepares a proposed rule for publication in  the Federal Register.  Before the proposed rule is published, a draft  receives considerable internal review by officials in the Service\u2019s field,  regional, and headquarters offices.  The review by officials in the field and  regional offices helps ensure the exercise of sound professional judgment.  The field office that is responsible for the listing provides the appropriate  regional office with the draft of the proposed rule and all supporting  scientific information.  Officials in the regional office review the proposed  rule to ensure that scientific information supports the proposed rule.   Regions are responsible for ensuring that the proposed rule is scientifically  accurate and biologically and legally sound.  Regional officials told us that  the review is an opportunity for the region to identify information gaps and  issues concerning how the information supports the conclusions.  At the  Service\u2019s headquarters, the draft proposed rule is reviewed to ensure that it  is consistent with other listing rules and complies with national policies.   Either the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service or the Assistant  Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks approves all proposed rules  before publication.", "Upon publication, the public has at least 60 days to provide comments on a  proposed rule.  The Service may extend the public comment period and/or  reopen it at a later date.  Service officials told us that the public comment  period is an opportunity to reach biologists, scientists, academicians, and  advocacy groups that the Service may not have contacted previously.  The  Service also holds public hearings, if requested.  At the end of the public  comment period, the Service reevaluates all the data, including the  comments received since the proposal was published, to determine  whether the listing is still warranted.  If not, the proposal will be  withdrawn.  The Service must publish its final decision within 12 months of  its proposal.  In cases when experts disagree on the accuracy or sufficiency  of the available data concerning the proposed listing, or the release of  additional information that may affect the outcome of the petition is  expected, the proposal may be extended 6 months beyond the normal 12- month time frame.  In the event that the listing is warranted, the Service  prepares a final rule, incorporating appropriate changes based on the  information received during the comment period.   Final rules are subject  to the same internal review process as proposed rules and are approved by  either the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service or Assistant Secretary  for Fish and Wildlife and Parks before being published.", "The procedures for designating critical habitat are similar to those for  listing a species.  However, in designating critical habitat, the Service must  also take into consideration the economic and other impacts of specifying  any particular area as critical habitat.  The Assistant Secretary of Fish and  Wildlife and Parks approves critical habitat designations.", "Officials at all levels of the agency demonstrated familiarity with the  requirements of the review process and stated that they believe it provides  the general guidelines necessary to ensure the best available data are  identified and properly interpreted.  Field office officials noted that  proposed and final rules are challenged internally to ensure they can  withstand public scrutiny and that while rulemakings are initiated at the  field level, extensive review ensures that the entire agency is on board  before anything is finalized.  Scientists and other agency personnel told us  that they use the process to test the validity of their listing and critical  habitat decisions.

For regulatory  decisions, peer review can provide for independent and expert analysis to  complement the adversarial and political nature of rulemaking.", "While many federal agencies were already using peer review, the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) issued guidance in 2002 recommending  that federal agencies utilize formal, independent external peer review (peer  review by individuals outside of the agency) to ensure the quality of data  and analytic results disseminated to the public.  It also recommended that  peer reviewers be selected primarily on the basis of their technical  expertise, that they disclose any source of bias (either prior technical or  policy positions or sources of personal and institutional funding from  which they may benefit), and that peer review be conducted in an open and  rigorous manner.", "Federal agencies have adopted a variety of peer-review practices,  depending on the nature of the product or decision under review.  As we  reported in 1999, peer-review practices at federal agencies vary according  to their intended use and form.  According to OMB\u2019s 2002 guidance,  agencies should tailor the rigor and intensity of peer review in accordance  with the significance of risk or management implications of the information  involved.   The form of peer review can range from informal consultations  with agency colleagues not involved in the earlier stages of the project to  formal external advisory panels, which can span several years and cost  thousands of dollars.  In addition, for each different form of peer review,  there are multiple variations\u2014the amount of time allocated for the review,  the number of reviewers, and whether the review occurs internally or  externally\u2014all of which affect the overall time and cost required to  conduct a review.", "In addition to its internal decision-making processes, the Service uses  external peer review of listing and critical habitat decisions to ensure that  the best biological and commercial information is being considered.  The  Service\u2019s peer-review policy requires officials to solicit the opinions of  three appropriate and independent experts regarding scientific data and  assumptions supporting listing and critical habitat decisions.  Peer  reviewers are selected at the discretion of the field office scientists  responsible for developing listing and critical habitat decisions.  The  reviewers, who may come from the academic and scientific community,  tribal and other Native American groups, federal and state agencies, and/or  the private sector, are selected on the basis of their independence and  expertise on the species being considered, similar species, the species\u2019  habitat, or other relevant subject matter.  The Service\u2019s scientists may ask  peer reviewers to critique specific aspects of the proposed rule, such as the  Service\u2019s interpretation of a particular study, or they may ask reviewers to  comment on the rule in its entirety.", "The Service\u2019s peer-review policy generally appears to be appropriate for the  circumstances in which it is used.  Although other agencies may use more  rigorous forms of peer review, such as convening a peer-review panel or a  science advisory board, the Service\u2019s peer-review process allows the  Service to make listing and critical habitat decisions under relatively short  time frames (the Service usually asks peer reviewers to perform their  review during the public comment period\u2014normally 60 days\u2014while a  peer-review panel may span several months or years).  However, to help  ensure the identification of complete and current information on a species  and its habitat, the Service may contact experts during the status review.  In  addition, any decisions that are issued as \u201cfinal\u201d rules can later be  reconsidered as circumstances warrant or new information becomes  available.  In fact, a species can be delisted if new information surfaces  indicating that the original decision to list was not warranted.", "One limitation that the Service faces in getting an independent review is the  scarcity of experts on a particular species.  For example, in some instances,  the most qualified experts to peer review a decision may have authored  some of the studies that the Service used to support its decision, forcing  the Service to balance expertise with independence.  However, according  to a National Academy of Sciences report that reviewed the Environmental  Protection Agency\u2019s use of peer review for similar actions, to choose an  individual to peer review who is both an expert and independent might be  impossible, or might not promote the best possible review.  In such cases,  an appropriate balance of views may be sought to ensure that different  interpretations on the scientific and technical merit of a decision are taken  into consideration.  Such cases should, however, be fully disclosed.  Other  organizations have developed procedures for assessing the independence  of peer reviewers, ranging from simply requiring peer reviewers to disclose  any potential bias, to using third parties to identify peer reviewers based, in  part, on their independence.  Service officials told us that they have not  adopted a formal procedure to assess peer reviewers\u2019 independence, and  the Service does not publicly disclose in the Federal Register potential  conflicts or prior involvement by its peer reviewers when the Service  publishes the final rule.", "The Service generally complied with its peer-review policy of soliciting  peer review from at least three reviewers during fiscal years 1999 through  2002.  During this time, the Service solicited three or more peer reviewers  in 94 out of the 100 listing and critical habitat decisions it made.  In three  instances the Service solicited fewer than three peer reviewers, and in  three other instances documentation was unavailable to indicate how many  reviewers were asked. (See app. III for a complete list of the decisions  with the number of peer reviewers solicited, the number that responded,  and how they responded.)", "While the Service generally complied with its policy to seek peer reviewers,  reviewers often did not respond.  As shown in figure 4, the Service received  responses from three or more peer reviewers in 38 decisions for which it  solicited at least three peer reviewers.  It received either one or two  responses in 41 decisions, and no responses in 15 decisions.", "Field office scientists, as well as an expert on peer review, reported a  variety of reasons for the limited number of responses, including (1) the  potential peer reviewers had busy schedules and felt constrained by the  short time frames allotted to conduct the review, and (2) the potential  reviewers were unwilling to conduct peer review either because they did  not want to become involved in a controversial decision or because they  did not want to work without compensation.  In addition, the field office  scientists reported that potential peer reviewers may not be inclined to  conduct peer review because they found nothing to criticize or had already  provided comments at an earlier stage of the decision, such as during the  status review.", "Recognizing the importance of peer review, some regional and field offices  have taken steps to increase the number of respondents.  For example,  some field offices contact potential peer reviewers in advance, rather than  initiating contact just before the decision is open for peer review; others  maintain communication with the peer reviewers throughout the process.  For example, the Pacific Islands field office in Honolulu, Hawaii, has  assigned an administrative staff person to initiate phone calls and E-mails  to help remind and encourage peer reviewers to respond.  This staff person  also monitors the implementation of the peer-review policy and tracks  results.  In order to increase the likelihood that at least three peer  reviewers respond to a request, some field offices request peer reviews  from more than three individuals. Field office scientists suggested other  ways to increase the response rate, such as providing monetary  compensation, using a third party to select and coordinate peer review,  narrowing the scope of the review, and providing more time for review."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Peer Reviewers and Others Conclude that Most Listing Decisions Are Based on Best Available Science, but Concerns about Critical Habitat Decisions Remain", "paragraphs": ["External reviews of listing and critical habitat decisions indicate that most  decisions are generally scientifically supported, but concerns about the  adequacy of critical habitat determinations remain.

For  example, several attorneys, who represent the regulated community in  challenges to the Service\u2019s decisions, stated that, given the Service\u2019s short  time frames and limited resources, the science used to support most listing  decisions did not present a significant problem.  However, these attorneys  and others contend that the \u201cbest available data\u201d standard does not provide  enough certainty that a species is threatened or endangered and suggest  that a more stringent standard should be developed.  On the other hand,  interested parties representing a diverse set of interests raised concerns  that Service officials at the Headquarters level are succumbing to political  pressures to not list species despite support from regional and field  scientists who believe evidence shows that listing is warranted.  Service  scientists told us they believe many listed species have low populations  and/or face clearly identified threats, indicating that the species are at risk.  They said that many listing decisions have been made to protect species  native to a specific area, with a narrow range, or for which substantial  scientific information was already available or easy to collect.  On the other  hand, the scientists noted that collecting information becomes more  difficult and costly when a wide-ranging species may be at risk.   Additionally, several scientific disagreements regarding listing decisions  have surfaced in recent years, mostly concerning whether the amount of  information available at the time a decision is made suffices as a basis for a  decision.

The  National Research Council (NRC) reached similar conclusions in a 1995  report, finding that many of the conflicts and disagreements over the  Endangered Species Act do not appear to be based on scientific issues.   More recently, in 2002, NRC reviewed the genetic evidence used to support  one particular listing decision, the listing of the Gulf of Maine Atlantic  salmon distinct population segment.

In 2000, a federal court ruled that the decision to  list the Sacramento splittail was not supported by the best scientific  data available.  The splittail is a large fish with a distinctive tail and is  native to California\u2019s Central Valley. Regional water authorities  challenged the listing of the splittail on scientific grounds, asserting,  among other things, that the Service ignored an important study  indicating resiliency and an increasing abundance of the splittail. The  court rejected the Service\u2019s arguments that these data were not  submitted in time to be considered and were irrelevant, and found there  to be no indication that the Service considered substantial evidence that  suggested that the splittail should not be listed. The court thus  concluded that the Service had failed to consider all available data. The  Service is in the process of reevaluating this listing rule.", "Westslope cutthroat trout. In 2002, a federal court ruled that the  Service\u2019s decision not to list the Westslope cutthroat trout was not  supported by the best scientific data available.  The Westslope trout is  one of 14 subspecies of cutthroat trout native to streams in the western  United States.  In its decision not to list the trout, the Service identified  hybridization (the breeding with other species of trout) as one of the  threats to the species, but included these hybrid fish in the population  considered for listing. The court noted that if hybridization were a  \u201cthreat\u201d to the species, it would seem logical that hybrid fish should not  be included in the population under consideration.  After explaining that  the identification of the existing population of the trout was vital to the  ultimate listing determination, the court found that the record failed to  offer a rationale for including hybrid stocks in the population that it  considered for listing, and concluded that the Service had ignored  existing scientific data for assessing the degree of hybridization that  may be appropriate to include in the population. The court remanded  the case to the Service for reconsideration.", "The Service lost the following two cases because it failed to assess whether  the species was imperiled throughout \u201ca significant portion of its range.\u201d", "Flat-tailed horned lizard. In 2001, an environmental group successfully  challenged the Service\u2019s decision not to list the flat-tailed horned lizard,  a small lizard found in desert lands in the southwestern United States.  In reaching its decision, the Service concluded that regardless of the  threats to the lizard on private lands, large populations of the lizard and  areas of its habitat were already protected under a conservation  agreement on public lands and that the species was sufficiently  protected from further threats. The court found that the Service should  have performed an analysis to determine whether the private lands  constituted \u201ca significant portion of  range\u201d and, if so,  whether the lizard was or would become extinct in that area. The court  remanded the case to the Service for those determinations.", "Queen Charlotte goshawk. In 2002, an environmental group successfully  challenged the Service\u2019s decision not to list the Queen Charlotte  goshawk, a forest-dwelling bird of prey found throughout North  America. In reaching its decision, the Service considered the  goshawk\u2019s presence in southeast Alaska, the Queen Charlotte Islands,  and Vancouver Island in Canada.  The Service found that the goshawk  was not threatened or endangered in southeast Alaska or the Queen  Charlotte Islands, but the Service did not make a determination  regarding the goshawk\u2019s status on Vancouver Island.  The Service  contended that the goshawk\u2019s status on Vancouver Island did not matter  because that area did not represent a significant portion of the  goshawk\u2019s range. The decision in this case upheld the Service\u2019s  determination regarding southeast Alaska and the Queen Charlotte  Islands, finding that the Service had properly used the best available  science.  However, the decision went on to conclude that Vancouver  Island represented a significant portion of the goshawk\u2019s range and that  the case should be remanded to the Service to determine whether the  goshawk was threatened or endangered on Vancouver Island."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Service Has Delisted Few Species on the Basis of New Scientific Information Showing That Listing Was Not Warranted", "paragraphs": ["In addition to removing recovered or extinct species from the list of  threatened or endangered species, the Service can also delist a species if  new information becomes available to show that protection under the act is  not warranted.

The one reviewer responding to the proposed  critical habitat designation of the Zapata bladderpod, a flowering plant  that grows in Texas, stated that the areas selected on state and private  lands were too small to support viable populations or the area was not  always suitable habitat for the species. The reviewer also said it was  premature to select those sites given the lack of information about the  species.", "Cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl. The one reviewer responding to the  proposed critical habitat designation for the cactus ferruginous pygmy- owl, a small bird found in the southwestern United States, disagreed  with the designation on the grounds that there were too many  unknowns about the species\u2019 habitat requirements to support a  determination about its critical habitat.", "Newcomb\u2019s snail.

One of the reviewers who disagreed stated  that there was inadequate information to make a determination because  habitat requirements for the snail were limited to generalized  observations in the field and thus were speculative. The reviewer said  the designation did not identify the habitat features essential to the  conservation of the species and was premature until additional  biological information was obtained. Similarly, the other reviewer  objecting to the determination did so largely because of his  understanding that the process was based on few published scientific  studies, and much was still unknown about the species\u2019 habitat  requirements.", "Even though peer reviewers may have concurred with the Service\u2019s critical  habitat designation, many provided clarifications or suggested  modifications.  We analyzed the peer reviewers\u2019 responses for 16 of the 27  critical habitat decisions the Service made.  There were 35 peer-review  responses to these 16 decisions.  Nearly all of the reviewers provided  specific clarifications on information contained in the rule or suggestions  for altering the habitat area selected.  For instance, in many of the  responses, the reviewer agreed with the proposal in general, but stated that  additional lands should be included in the critical habitat designation and  cited scientific reasons for increasing habitat areas. In one decision, a  reviewer generally supporting the proposed critical habitat of the arroyo  toad (an endangered toad found in coastal and desert drainages in  California) identified specific areas where he believed the toad ranged  more widely and would therefore warrant additional critical habitat.  Another reviewer, generally supporting the proposed critical habitat for the  Great Lakes population of the piping plover (a small shorebird that occurs  across North America), identified sites she believed should be added to the  designation and areas she believed to be unsuitable for the species and  therefore should be excluded from the designation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Courts Have Overturned Few Critical Habitat Decisions on the Basis of Inadequate Science", "paragraphs": ["As with listing decisions, and due in part to the deference the courts grant  to the Service, most litigation has not directly challenged the Service\u2019s use  of science in making critical habitat determinations.  Based on a review of  federal court cases decided during fiscal years 1999 through 2002, we  identified 11 cases in which a court issued an opinion regarding the  Service\u2019s critical habitat decisions.  Most of these 11 cases dealt with  nonscience issues, such as the Service\u2019s failure to designate critical habitat  for a listed species.  However, the courts overturned critical habitat  decisions on the basis of issues related to the use of scientific data in the  following two cases:    Rio Grande silvery minnow. In 2000, a federal court invalidated the  critical habitat of the Rio Grande silvery minnow based in part on  scientific grounds. Multiple groups, including the state of New Mexico,  challenged the designation of critical habitat for the silvery minnow, a  fish found exclusively in the Rio Grande River in the Southwest. The  critical habitat designation for this fish consisted of a 163-mile stretch of  the main stem of the Rio Grande River. The court ruled in favor of the  plaintiffs because it found that the Service\u2019s final rule had failed to (1)  define with sufficient specificity what biological and physical features  were essential to the species\u2019 survival and recovery and (2) indicate  where in each reach of the river such features existed. For example, the  court said that the Service\u2019s statement in the rule regarding the  minnow\u2019s need for \u201csufficient flowing water\u201d provided vague  generalities that stated little more than what is required for any fish  species. As a result of this court ruling, the Service is in the process of  redesignating critical habitat for this species.", "Cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl. In 2001, a court struck down the  critical habitat designation for the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl  because, among other reasons, the designation was not supported by  the best available scientific data.  The final critical habitat for the  pygmy-owl, a small bird found in the southwestern United States,  consisted of over 700,000 acres of riparian and upland habitat in  Arizona.  The court noted that the determination of critical habitat is to  be made on the basis of the \u201cbest scientific data available\u201d and that this  involves identifying geographic areas \u201cessential to the conservation of  the species.\u201d  The court then pointed out that systematic owl surveys  had not yet been completed over the entire potential habitat in Arizona,  and that the Service determined critical habitat by designating areas  where the pygmy-owls had been sighted, areas that it thought would be  consistent with the species\u2019 known habitat, and all the land in between.   The court also pointed out that, in addition to the areas actually  occupied by the pygmy-owls, the Service had included areas where it  thought they could live.  The court appeared to conclude that, in order  to include areas that were not presently occupied, the Service should  have determined that such areas were in fact essential to the  conservation of the species.  Although the Service had already agreed to  reconsider the economic analysis used in the critical habitat  designation, the court concluded that a \u201cbroader reconsideration\u201d of the  critical habitat designation was necessary.  The Service is in the process  of redesignating critical habitat for the pygmy-owl."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "The Service Has Failed to Address Known Problems with the Critical Habitat Program", "paragraphs": ["The Service\u2019s critical habitat program currently faces a serious crisis that  extends well beyond the use of science in making decisions.  Litigation now  dominates the program, leading the Assistant Secretary for Fish and  Wildlife and Parks in the Department of the Interior to recently declare that  the system for designating critical habitat is \u201cbroken\u201d because it provides  little conservation benefit while consuming significant resources.", "A key court case in 1997 invalidated the Service\u2019s position on when critical  habitat should be designated.  The Endangered Species Act generally  requires the Service to designate critical habitat for listed species unless  the Service determines it is \u201cnot prudent,\u201d and the Service\u2019s regulations  spell out that it is not prudent to designate critical habitat if doing so would  not be \u201cbeneficial to the species.\u201d  As a result, prior to 1997, the Service  had designated critical habitat for only 113 of the 1,023 domestic species  that it had listed.  The Service reasoned that designating critical habitat did  not benefit the species because the benefits that critical habitat provided  duplicated those benefits provided by listing the species.  The 1997 court  case invalidated the Service\u2019s reasoning, ruling that the Service\u2019s  determination that it was not prudent to designate critical habitat for the  coastal California gnatcatcher, a songbird unique to coastal southern  California, was not justified.  One of the reasons that the Service  concluded that it was not prudent to designate critical habitat was because  it believed that such a designation would not appreciably benefit the  species because most populations of gnatcatchers were found on private  lands to which the act\u2019s critical habitat protections would not apply.  The  court found that this reasoning improperly expanded what Congress had  intended to be a narrow exception to designating critical habitat.  The court  concluded that the Service had disregarded \u201cthe clear congressional intent  that the imprudence exception be a rare exception.\u201d  Since then, court  orders and settlement agreements have compelled the Service to designate  critical habitat for species for which it had previously determined that it  was not prudent to do so.", "Subsequently, a 2001 court case led the Service to reconsider some of its  critical habitat designations.  The case involved the requirement of the act  that the Service consider the economic impact of designating a particular  area as critical habitat.  According to the act, the Service may exclude areas  from critical habitat if it determines that the benefits of excluding the area  outweigh the benefits of including the area as critical habitat unless  excluding it would result in the extinction of the species.  For example, in  1997, the Service designated critical habitat for the southwestern willow  flycatcher, a small bird that nests in riparian areas in the southwestern  United States.  Because the Service believed that designating critical  habitat would not result in additional restrictions on activities beyond  those resulting from listing the species, it reasoned that there would be no  significant economic impact associated with designating critical habitat for  the flycatcher.  However, the court disagreed.  It found that since the act  clearly barred the Service from considering economic impacts in listing  decisions, but required they be considered in critical habitat decisions, the  Service was not free to ignore the economic impacts of listing a species  when designating critical habitat for that species.  The court held that the  Service had to consider all of the economic impacts of a critical habitat  determination, regardless of whether those impacts were also attributable  to listing or other causes.  Since this decision was issued, court orders and  settlement agreements have prompted the Service to re-issue some critical  habitat decisions to comply with this standard.", "Since these two court rulings, the Service\u2019s critical habitat program has  become dominated by litigation.  Each critical habitat designation made  since 1997 has resulted from a court order or a settlement agreement, and  the Service expects that it will have to dedicate significant resources  through fiscal year 2008 to comply with existing court orders and  settlement agreements.  The department believes that this flood of  litigation over critical habitat designation is preventing the Service from  taking what it deems to be higher priority activities, such as addressing the  approximately 250 \u201ccandidate\u201d species waiting to go through the listing  process (listing and critical habitat activities are funded under the same  line item in the department\u2019s budget).  Service officials noted that there are  other court decisions that may cause additional problems for the program  in the future.", "The Service has been aware of problems with its critical habitat program  for a number of years.  The Service noted significant problems with its  critical habitat program in 1997, and in 1999 it issued a Federal Register  notice announcing that its system for designating critical habitat was not  working and soliciting comments on its intention to develop policy or  guidance and/or to revise regulations or seek legislative corrections to  clarify the role of critical habitat in conserving endangered species.  In  particular, the Service stated its intention to consider when critical habitat  designation would provide additional protection beyond that provided by  listing.  The Service also announced its intention to streamline the process  for designating critical habitat to be more cost-effective and in line with the  amount of conservation benefit provided to the species.  In particular, the  Service declared that it needs to develop a much less labor-intensive  process for describing the areas proposed for designation as critical  habitat.  The Service also stated that it can streamline and make more cost- effective the process to conduct the economic analyses required to  designate critical habitat and that it can more efficiently conduct the  analyses required under the National Environmental Policy Act.  The  Service also noted that critical habitat litigation and related court orders  were consuming much of the resources devoted to listing and critical  habitat, and delaying other activities that it considered higher priority, such  as addressing petitions submitted by citizens, working with landowners on  conservation projects, and completing final actions to list species.   However, no additional guidance or revisions were issued, and the Service  continues to follow the same unworkable system.", "The Department of the Interior recently echoed concerns with the Service\u2019s  critical habitat program and the limited conservation benefit it provides to  species.  In April 2003, the Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and  Parks testified before Congress on the critical habitat program, stating that  it is \u201cbroken\u201d and in \u201cchaos.\u201d  He noted that litigation support is consuming  valuable resources and that complying with court orders and settlement  agreements has sharply reduced the Service\u2019s ability to prioritize its listing  and critical habitat actions.  Service scientists working in field offices  expressed similar concerns to us about the critical habitat program, raising  questions about the purpose of critical habitat and the designation process.   An attorney in the Solicitor\u2019s office told us that guidance would improve the  Service\u2019s critical habitat decisions and make the decisions more defensible  in court in the future.", "Despite the long-standing concerns over the role and implementation of the  critical habitat program, the Service has done little to resolve them.  In a  report issued in June 2002, we recognized the impact that litigation was  having on the critical habitat program and recommended that the Service  expedite its efforts to develop guidance on designating critical habitat for  listed species to help reduce the influence of future litigation.  Better  guidance would help reduce the number of legal challenges to the Service\u2019s  critical habitat designations and allow the Service to better withstand legal  challenges when they arise.  While the Service agreed with our  recommendation, it responded that work on critical habitat guidance had  been delayed pending Service efforts to complete higher priority tasks,  including court orders to complete listing and critical habitat decisions and  did not commit to a schedule for issuing the guidance.  An official with  Interior\u2019s Solicitor\u2019s office told us that one factor limiting the agency\u2019s  ability to complete these tasks is the Service\u2019s inability to devote significant  listing and critical habitat resources to policy initiatives without risking  contempt of court because such action would force the agency to divert  resources away from activities required to comply with court orders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["The Service\u2019s critical habitat program faces a serious crisis because of  extensive litigation that is consuming significant program resources.

In no  instance did we attempt to evaluate scientific data and render an opinion.  For this evaluation, we define \u201cscience\u201d as the collection and interpretation  of biological information, such as the identification of a species and its  habitat needs.  This definition does not include the legal policies and  definitions found in the law or used to implement or interpret the  Endangered Species Act.  However, we acknowledge that there is not  always a clear distinction between the interpretation of biological  information and the policies and definitions used to interpret the act.", "In meeting our first objective, we examined the Service\u2019s decision-making  process to determine the extent to which it would likely lead to decisions  based on the best available science.  We reviewed the Service\u2019s policies and  procedures related to how it makes these decisions and discussed the  process and procedures with key officials at the Service\u2019s headquarters and  with staff in the Service\u2019s regional and field offices to determine their  knowledge of the process and how they implemented it.  We also spoke  with peer-review experts and examined the literature on the processes that  organizations use to peer review their decisions and products to assess the  reasonableness of the Service\u2019s policy to peer review proposed listing and  critical habitat decisions.", "In meeting both objectives, we obtained from the Service a list of the  decisions to list species and designate critical habitat that the Service  finalized during fiscal years 1999 through 2002.  To verify the completeness  of the provided list of decisions, we compared it with a second independent  database maintained by the Service.  We identified one decision that was  not on the original list provided to us by the Service.  We included that  decision in our analysis.  Based on this information, we identified 101 final  decisions to list or designate critical habitat that were published in the  Federal Register during fiscal years 1999 through 2002.", "We examined the Federal Register notices for the 101 decisions to  determine (1) the extent to which the Service complied with its peer-review  policy to request at least three peer reviewers to review each decision, (2)  the number that reviewed each decision, and (3) whether or not the  reviewer(s) supported the decision.  In 61 of the 101 decisions, we  extracted this information from the Federal Register.  For the remaining 40  decisions, we contacted the 18 field offices responsible for the decisions  and requested that they provide the peer-review documentation, including  copies of the peer reviewers\u2019 responses.  The Service provided us with the  missing information in all but seven instances; in five of those instances  partial information was available.", "To assess the accuracy of the information reported in the Federal Register  notices, we requested that the Service provide documentation for the peer- review information, including peer reviewers\u2019 responses, for 8 of the 61  decisions for which complete information was available in the Federal  Register notice.  We selected these 8 decisions in the following way.  In  order to minimize the burden on the Service\u2019s field staff, we limited our  universe to the decisions that were the responsibility of the18 field offices  that we already intended to contact.  These offices were responsible for 48  of the 61 decisions for which there was complete information in the  Federal Register notice.  We then randomly chose 1 decision from each of  the three offices with the most decisions.  Collectively these offices were  responsible for 25 of the 48 decisions.   We also randomly chose 5 of the  remaining 23 decisions.  We compared the documentation provided to us  with the information in the corresponding Federal Register notices.  We  found no discrepancies.  However, we did find minor discrepancies  between other Federal Register notices and the documentation the Service  provided to us.  We reconciled these discrepancies. Additionally, based on a  limited review, we found the Service\u2019s procedures reasonable for ensuring  that its database contains accurate information.  For example, the Service  regularly samples data recently added to the database for accuracy.  We did  not determine the extent to which any of the Service\u2019s final decisions  reflected the comments and opinions of the peer reviewers.", "In addition to determining whether peer reviewers supported the decision  they reviewed, we performed a content analysis on the peer-review  responses for 16 critical habitat decisions to more fully characterize the  opinions of the peer reviewers.  We chose to perform a content analysis on  the responses to critical habitat decisions because these decisions are  open-ended, requiring the Service to determine how much critical habitat  to designate and where that habitat should be located.  There were 35 peer- review responses for these 16 decisions.", "To determine how well the Service\u2019s listing and critical habitat decisions  are withstanding legal challenges to the science supporting those  decisions, we used common legal research methods to identify federal  court cases related to the Service\u2019s listing and critical habitat decisions.  We  identified and reviewed 25 cases that were decided during fiscal years 1999  through 2002 that involved a challenge to a Service listing decision and/or  critical habitat decision, and in which the court rendered a decision on the  listing or critical habitat issue.", "To determine the extent to which the Service has delisted species because  new scientific information surfaced indicating that listing was not  originally warranted, we used information from the Service\u2019s publicly  accessible database.  We included in our analysis all decisions to delist  species from the inception of the act through March 2003. We compared  this information with information published in the Federal Register.  We  found no discrepancies.", "Finally, to get a fuller understanding of the degree of scientific controversy  regarding listing and critical habitat decisions, we solicited the opinions of  experts and others and reviewed published studies.  To illustrate the nature  of scientific controversy regarding listing and critical habitat decisions, we  developed a list of decisions for which there was some degree of scientific  controversy. We developed this list by asking experts in the private,  academic, government, and nonprofit sectors spanning the political  spectrum to identify recent decisions that were particularly controversial  due to scientific disagreements and briefly explain the nature of the  controversy.  We limited our analysis to decisions finalized during fiscal  years 1993 through 2002.  In addition, we asked each expert for the names  of other experts who could help us develop our list.  We stopped contacting  experts when we began to get repetitive responses.  We then identified  common issues related to the controversies to characterize the types of  disagreements involved with each of the decisions.  We based this on the  information provided by the experts and information published in the  Federal Register.

Regarding critical habitat decisions, we found there has been scientific  controversy surrounding whether the areas chosen as critical habitat is  sufficiently defined or the overall information used to support the  designation is adequate."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Listing", "paragraphs": ["Although we found that scientific disagreements surrounding listing  decisions are not widespread, some of the controversy in recent years can  be categorized as \u201cscience-related.\u201d Experts and others working with the  Endangered Species Act that we spoke with identified 11 species where  there was significant scientific controversy surrounding the decisions to  list the species.  Our discussions with these individuals and a review of  related Federal Register notices revealed that the most common scientific  disagreements hinge on whether enough information was available to  determine (1) whether the plants or animals under consideration qualified  as a \u201cspecies\u201d as defined by the act, (2) the status of the species, or (3) the  degree of threat that the species faces.", "Critics of some listing decisions argued that the Service lacked information  to determine whether the entity in question met the definition of a  \u201cspecies.\u201d  The act defines a species as including \u201cany subspecies of fish or  wildlife or plants, and any distinct population segment of any species of  vertebrate fish or wildlife which interbreeds when mature.\u201d There is  general agreement within the scientific community as to what constitutes a  species and this has not been a major source of controversy in most listing  decisions. Disagreements typically arise over whether entities that are  genetically, morphologically, or behaviorally distinct, but not distinct  enough to merit the rank of species; qualify for protection as a distinct  population segment (DPS).  Under Service policy, to be identified as a DPS,  a population segment must be both discrete and significant. In order to be  discrete, the population must be markedly separate from other populations  as a consequence of physical, physiological, ecological, or behavioral  factors.  If a population segment is considered discrete, its biological and  ecological significance will then be considered.  This consideration would  include such factors as evidence that the loss of the population would  result in a significant gap in the range of a species.", "For example, disagreement surrounded the decision to list the population  of the Sonoma County California tiger salamander, a large terrestrial  salamander that is native to California.  According to critics of the listing  decision, the results of genetic testing did not show the salamander to be  distinct, or discrete, from other populations of the California tiger  salamander and therefore the population did not qualify as a DPS. The  Service disagreed with the critics\u2019 interpretation of the data, stating that it  believed the data referred to by the critics show the salamander to be  distinct from other populations.  The Service said that additional sampling  and genetic work provided further substantial evidence of the genetic  discreteness of the population. Additionally, the Service relied on the  salamander\u2019s geographic isolation in making a determination that the  population qualified for protection as a DPS.", "Service policy also allows international governmental boundaries that  delineate differences in the management of the species or its habitat to be  used to determine if a species meets the discrete criterion. Some critics  have argued against using international boundaries as a criterion to define  a DPS.  For example, critics of the decision to list the Arizona population  segment of the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl stated that the Service had  no biological or regulatory authority to rely on international boundaries to  draw a distinct population segment. The pygmy-owl is a small bird that  occurs in the southwestern United States extending south into Mexico.", "The Service recognizes that using international boundaries as a measure of  discreteness may introduce a nonbiological element to the recognition of a  distinct population segment. However, in its policy, the Service determined  that it is reasonable to recognize units delimited by international  boundaries when these units coincide with differences in the management,  status, or exploitation of a species. In the case of the pygmy-owl, the  Service reported the status of the owl in the United States is different from  that in Mexico, and Arizona is the only area within which the government  of the United States can affect protection and recovery for the species, so it  was appropriate to protect the pygmy-owl as a DPS.", "In its review of science and the Endangered Species Act, the National  Research Council found that although it may be appropriate to delineate  population segments based on political boundaries, there are no scientific  reasons to do so as these boundaries often do not always coincide with  major natural geographic boundaries. To provide more scientific  objectivity in identifying distinct population segments, the Council  recommended that the Service define a distinct population segment based  solely on scientific grounds and limit the definition to segments of  biological diversity containing the potential for a unique evolutionary  future. Such segments would be determined by looking at such factors as a  population\u2019s morphology (or physical appearance), behavior, genetics and  geographical separation or isolation from other populations.  Service  officials agree that the inclusion of international boundaries in determining  whether a population segment is discrete is sometimes undertaken as a  matter of policy rather than science. However, the Service believes that  using international borders is appropriate and necessary to comply with  congressional intent.  When there are international boundaries that  coincide with differences in the management, status, or exploitation of a  species, as described above, the Service stated that it is appropriate to  recognize these borders when making a listing determination.", "Scientific disagreement also surrounds the status of a species and the  degree to which identified threats imperil it. When making a listing  determination, the Service must evaluate a species\u2019 status, such as where it  occurs or its population numbers, and the degree of threat it faces. The  Service can determine that a species is threatened or endangered because  of any of several factors such as the destruction of habitat, disease or  predation, or other natural or manmade factors affecting the species\u2019  survival. Several of the scientific disputes that we encountered centered on  how widespread the species in question is or how intense or significant the  threats to the species are.  For example, state agencies commenting on the  proposal to list the Canada lynx said that the rule failed to demonstrate  there were significant reductions to the species\u2019 population. Critics of the  rule said that the scientific information\u2014which was largely in the form of  one comprehensive report\u2014failed to assess lynx population size, status,  and trends. The Service agreed that the available information concerning  lynx population status, trends, and historic range is limited. However, after  reviewing historic and current records for both Canada and the United  States, sightings and track records, personal communications with lynx,  hare, and forest ecology experts, and a review of all available literature, the  Service said it was able to make several conclusions about the status of the  lynx and found that it warranted listing as threatened.", "Additionally, critics of the proposal to list the lynx claimed that the Service  failed to demonstrate significant threats to the lynx\u2019s survival. For example,  some stated that there is little evidence to support claims that current  management practices, including timber harvesting and human access,  adversely affect the lynx. While the Service acknowledged the lack of  quantifiable information to determine whether some of the possible threats  have or would have resulted in lynx declines, it concluded that the factor  threatening lynx in the contiguous United States is the lack of guidance in  existing federal land management plans for conservation of lynx and lynx  habitat.", "Service officials told us that it is important to consider both the threats and  the status of the species when making a listing determination. For example,  if only a species\u2019 population numbers were considered, it might appear to  be abundant. Once the threats are factored in, however, the species might  be threatened or endangered. On the other hand, if the species numbers are  low but the species faces no considerable threats, it may not warrant  protection under the act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Critical Habitat", "paragraphs": ["Experts and others we spoke to identified 10 species where there was  scientific controversy concerning the decision to designate critical habitat  for them.  For example, one concern is whether the area chosen as critical  habitat is sufficiently defined or the overall information used to support the  designation is adequate.  Most of the identified species are widespread or  occur in rapidly developing areas, such as southern California.", "One of the major sources of disagreement is the way in which the Service  identifies land to be included in critical habitat.  The Service is required to  designate as critical habitat those areas that it deems essential to a species\u2019  conservation and that may require special management considerations and  protection. To reach this conclusion, the Service describes the species\u2019  habitat needs for conservation, or the species\u2019 \u201cprimary constituent  elements,\u201d such as nesting or spawning grounds, feeding sites, or areas  with specific geologic features or soil types. The Service\u2019s regulations also  require the delineation of critical habitat using reference points and lines as  found on standard topographic maps of the area. The Service uses written  descriptions and/or maps to outline the areas it considers critical habitat  for a listed species. In some cases, when maps are used to outline the area,  parts of the area that fall within the mapped boundaries do not contain the  primary constituent elements defined by the Service. For example, building  structures, roads, or other major structures, such as an airport, may fall  within the mapped boundaries of critical habitat, but are not suitable  habitat. The Service maintains that these areas would not be considered  critical habitat because they do not contain the primary constituent  elements needed by the species. The Service stated that the precise  mapping of critical habitat boundaries is impractical or impossible because  the legal descriptions for these precise boundaries would be unwieldy.", "The scientific controversy surrounding many of the critical habitat  proposals that we reviewed stems from disagreement or confusion over  which areas within the land outlined by the Service would count as critical  habitat. Critics responding to these proposed rules often complained that  the Service\u2019s definitions of primary constituent elements were vague or too  broad to be useful. Additionally, several critics found the Service\u2019s  assertion that only areas containing primary constituent elements would be  considered critical habitat to be confusing, noting that it did not allow for a  discrete boundary.  In some instances, landowners voiced concerns that  their property fell within proposed critical habitat boundaries even though  the land did not seem to contain the primary constituent elements. For  example, critics of the proposed critical habitat of the California red-legged  frog stated that the Service\u2019s description of the critical habitat was vague  and did not specifically identify the locations of the frog\u2019s habitat.", "Critics of the rule stated that the proposal was confusing and that  landowners would be forced to survey for the frog when undertaking a  project.  Such an action, they contended, is improper because it places the  onus on private landowners to make sure their land does not contain  critical habitat. The Service stated that due to the mapping unit it used it  was not able to exclude all nonessential lands, such as roads. According to  the Service, because these areas do not contain the primary constituent  elements, federal agencies would not be required to consult the Service  before taking action.", "We also identified scientific disagreement stemming from designations  made for species that require dynamic habitats. Designating critical habitat,  which requires selecting a fixed habitat area, can be particularly difficult  when a listed species may require a habitat that is dynamic, or changing, in  nature. For example, lands that have been burned, cleared, or otherwise  disturbed may be essential to a species or may be important for only  certain periods of a species\u2019 life cycle. Many landscapes change because of  natural causes, such as the age and make-up of a forest, and therefore it  may be difficult to designate one particular area as habitat because the area  may change over time, causing a change in the value of the habitat for the  listed species. For example, scientific disagreement surrounded the critical  habitat designation of the Southwestern willow flycatcher partly because  of the bird\u2019s changing habitat requirements. Comments received on the  proposed critical habitat rule stated that because riparian habitats are in a  constant state of change, any boundaries defined as critical habitat would  also be subject to change. Further, according to critics, the boundaries  described by the Service did not meet regulatory requirements because  they were difficult to interpret and could change seasonally. In the final  rule designating critical habitat, the Service agreed that its original  boundaries of critical habitat did not incorporate the dynamic nature of  riparian systems. To resolve this issue, the Service stated that the final  boundaries would be established in accordance with the 100-year flood  zone, which would include most changes in stream flow and most seasonal  changes.", "In addition to controversy surrounding the identification of specific areas  for critical habitat, many critics of the proposed rules that we reviewed  argued that the Service had insufficient information on which to base its  determination and that the Service should not designate critical habitat  until the habitat requirements of the species could be better defined. Other  critics objected to the Service\u2019s use of unpublished or otherwise  unavailable data, stating that this type of information is inadequate to  support critical habitat designations. Service officials said that they have  been required to complete critical habitat decisions under short time  frames because of court-imposed deadlines. According to Service officials,  given the resource and time constraints under which Service scientists  work, scientists are often unable to collect new information and agree that  the information available may be limited. Thus, the Service relies on both  unpublished and published information and will use whatever scientific  information it deems credible to help make a determination."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Bob Crystal, Charlie Egan,  Doreen Stolzenberg Feldman, Alyssa M.
