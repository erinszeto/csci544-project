This report discusses the extent to which the (1) CIO implemented selected IT oversight responsibilities, (2) Secret Service implemented leading IT workforce planning and management practices, and (3) Secret Service and DHS implemented selected performance monitoring practices for IITT. GAO assessed agency documentation against 14 selected component CIO responsibilities established in DHS policy; 15 selected leading workforce planning and management practices within 5 topic areas; and two selected leading industry project monitoring practices that, among other things, were, in GAO's professional judgment, of most significance to managing IITT."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Secret Service (Secret Service) Chief Information Officer (CIO) fully implemented 11 of 14 selected information technology (IT) oversight responsibilities, and partially implemented the remaining 3. The CIO partially implemented the responsibilities to establish a process that ensures the Secret Service reviews IT contracts; ensure that the component's IT policies align with the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) policies; and set incremental targets to monitor program progress. Additional efforts to fully implement these 3 responsibilities will further position the CIO to effectively manage the IT portfolio.", "Of the 15 selected practices within the 5 workforce planning and management areas, the Secret Service fully implemented 3 practices, partly implemented 8, and did not implement 4 (see table). Within the strategic planning area, the component partly implemented the practice to, among other things, develop IT competency needs. While the Secret Service had defined general core competencies for its workforce, the Office of the CIO (OCIO) did not identify all of the technical competencies needed to support its functions. As a result, the office was limited in its ability to address any IT competency gaps that may exist. Also, while work remains to improve morale across the component, the Secret Service substantially implemented the employee morale practices for its IT staff.", "Secret Service officials said the gaps in implementing the workforce practices were due to, among other things, their focus on reorganizing the IT workforce within OCIO. Until the Secret Service fully implements these practices for its IT workforce, it may be limited in its ability to ensure the timely and effective acquisition and maintenance of the component's IT infrastructure and services.", "Of the two selected IT project monitoring practices, DHS and the Secret Service fully implemented the first practice to monitor the performance of the Information Integration and Technology Transformation (IITT) investment. In addition, for the second practice\u2014to monitor projects on incremental development metrics\u2014the Secret Service fully implemented the practice on one of IITT's projects and partially implemented it on another. In particular, OCIO did not fully measure post-deployment user satisfaction with the system on one project. OCIO plans to conduct a user satisfaction survey of the system by September 2018, which should inform the office on whether the system is meeting users' needs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making 13 recommendations, including that the Secret Service establish a process that ensures the CIO reviews all IT contracts, as appropriate; and identify the skills needed for its IT workforce.

For example, the Secret  Service\u2019s criminal investigation activities encompass financial and  electronic crimes, such as identity theft, counterfeiting, and computer- based attacks on the nation\u2019s financial, banking, and telecommunications  infrastructure. In addition, its protective intelligence efforts include  investigating threats against protected persons and facilities, such as the  President and the White House. The Secret Service is also responsible  for certain security activities, including presidential inaugurations and  national conventions.", "To accomplish its mission, the Secret Service relies heavily on the use of  information technology (IT) infrastructure and communications systems.  The component\u2019s Chief Information Officer (CIO) plays a key role in  effectively managing this infrastructure and systems. Among other things,  the CIO is responsible for IT strategic planning and the management and  governance of the IT programs and infrastructure. The CIO is also  responsible for managing the component\u2019s IT workforce, which officials  from the Office of the CIO (OCIO) define as the government employees  who provide direct and indirect support of the day-to-day operations of the  Secret Service\u2019s enterprise systems and services.", "However, the Secret Service has faced longstanding challenges in  managing its IT environment. For example, a National Security Agency  audit of the environment in 2008 identified network and system  vulnerabilities that needed immediate remediation to protect the Secret  Service\u2019s systems and electronic information.", "To address the challenges with its IT environment, the Secret Service  initiated the Information Integration and Technology Transformation (IITT)  investment in 2009. IITT is a portfolio of programs and projects that are  intended to, among other things, modernize and enhance the IT network  infrastructure; provide hardware and software to ensure reliable and  consistent voice, data, and radio coverage for Secret Service agents; and  provide counterintelligence and data mining capabilities to improve  officials\u2019 ability to perform the component\u2019s investigative mission.", "Yet, the Secret Service\u2019s implementation of the IITT investment has also  been problematic. For example, in 2011, DHS\u2019s Office of Inspector  General reported that, among other things, the component\u2019s schedule for  implementing IITT was not realistic. Also in that 2011 report, the  Inspector General stated that, while the Secret Service had implemented  an internal governance approach for IITT (including establishing  governance policies and procedures), it had not implemented a formal  department-level IT governance mechanism to provide integrated  feedback and direction for the investment.", "Given the importance of effective IT management for achieving the Secret  Service\u2019s mission, you asked us to review the role of the Secret Service  CIO in overseeing the component\u2019s IT portfolio and workforce. Our  specific objectives were to evaluate the extent to which: (1) the Secret  Service CIO has implemented selected IT oversight responsibilities, (2)  the Secret Service has implemented leading workforce planning and  management practices for its IT workforce, and (3) the Secret Service  and DHS have implemented selected performance and progress  monitoring practices for the IITT investment.", "To address the first objective, we analyzed DHS\u2019s policies and guidance  on IT management to identify the responsibilities that were to be  implemented by the component-level CIO related to overseeing the  Secret Service\u2019s IT portfolio, including existing systems, acquisitions, and  investments. From the list of 33 responsibilities that we identified, we  then excluded the responsibility that was associated with information  security, which is expected to be addressed as part of a separate,  subsequent GAO review. We also excluded those responsibilities that  were significantly large in scope (e.g., implement an enterprise  architecture) or that, in our professional judgment, lacked specificity (e.g.,  provide timely delivery of mission IT services). As a result, we excluded  from consideration for this review a total of 10 CIO responsibilities.", "For the 23 that remained, we then combined certain responsibilities that  overlapped with other related responsibilities. For example, we combined  related responsibilities on the component CIO\u2019s review of IT contracts. As  a result, we were left with 14 responsibilities that were relevant for our  review. We then validated with the acting DHS CIO that these were key  responsibilities for the department\u2019s component-level CIOs. Following this  validation, we elected to include all 14 of the responsibilities in our review.  Appendix I identifies the 14 selected component-level CIO  responsibilities.", "We then assessed relevant Secret Service documentation to determine  the extent to which the CIO had implemented the selected  responsibilities. For example, we assessed monthly program  management reports demonstrating the CIO\u2019s oversight of IT programs,  projects, and systems; systems engineering life cycle technical review  briefings; the Secret Service\u2019s enterprise governance policy; and meeting  minutes from the DHS boards and councils on which the CIO participated.  We also selected and analyzed two random, non-generalizable samples  of a total of 33 IT contracts that the Secret Service awarded between  October 1, 2016, and June 30, 2017, as well as the associated approval  documentation, to determine whether or not the CIO or the CIO\u2019s  delegate had approved each of the contracts.", "Further, we interviewed Secret Service officials, including the CIO and  Deputy CIO, regarding the CIO\u2019s implementation of the 14 selected  component-level responsibilities. We assessed the evidence against the  selected responsibilities to determine the extent to which the CIO had  implemented the responsibilities.", "To address the second objective, we first identified seven topic areas  associated with human capital management based on our review of IT  workforce planning and management guidance issued by the Office of  Personnel Management, the Chief Human Capital Officers Council, DHS,  the Secret Service, and us. Among these topic areas, we then selected  five areas that, in our professional judgment, were of particular  importance to successful workforce planning and management. These  areas are: (1) strategic planning, (2) recruitment and hiring, (3) training  and development, (4) employee morale, and (5) performance  management.", "We also reviewed these same sources and identified numerous leading  practices associated with the five topic areas. Among these leading  practices, we then selected three practices within each of the five areas,  for a total of 15 practices. The selected practices were foundational  practices that, in our professional judgment, were of particular importance  to successful workforce planning and management. Appendix I identifies  the five workforce areas and the 15 associated practices that we  selected.", "We then assessed the Secret Service\u2019s workforce planning  documentation against the 15 selected leading practices. For example,  we analyzed the staffing model that the Secret Service used to determine  the number of IT staff it needed, as well as recruitment plans and action  plans for improving employee morale. We also interviewed Secret Service  officials\u2014including the CIO, Deputy CIO, and workforce planning staff\u2014 about the component\u2019s efforts to implement the selected leading practices  for its IT workforce.", "Regarding our assessments of the Secret Service\u2019s implementation of the  15 selected leading workforce planning and management practices, we  assessed a practice as being fully implemented if component officials  provided supporting documentation that demonstrated all aspects of the  practice. We assessed a practice as not implemented if the officials did  not provide any supporting documentation for that practice, or if they  provided documentation that did not demonstrate any aspect of the  practice. We assessed a practice as being partly implemented if the  officials provided supporting documentation that demonstrated some, but  not all, aspects of the selected practice.", "In addition, related to our assessments of the Secret Service\u2019s  implementation of the five selected overall workforce areas, we assessed  each area as follows, based on the implementation of the three selected  practices within each area:", "Fully implemented: The Secret Service provided evidence that it had  fully implemented all three of the practices within the workforce area;", "Substantially implemented: The Secret Service provided evidence that  fully implemented two practices and partly implemented the  remaining one practice within the workforce area, or  fully implemented one practice and partly implemented the  remaining two practices within the workforce area;", "Partially implemented: The Secret Service provided evidence that it  had partly implemented each of the three practices within the  workforce area;", "Minimally implemented: The Secret Service provided evidence that it partly implemented two practices and not implemented the  remaining one practice within the workforce area, or partly implemented one practice and not implemented the  remaining two practices within the workforce area; or", "Not implemented: The Secret Service did not provide evidence that it  had implemented any of the three practices within the workforce area.", "To address the third objective, we reviewed leading project monitoring  practices and guidance from the Software Engineering Institute. We then  selected two practices that, in our professional judgment, were of most  significance to managing the IITT investment given the phase of the life  cycle that the investment was in and the agile development methodology  that the Secret Service was using for certain projects within IITT. The  two selected practices were:", "Monitor program performance and conduct reviews at predetermined  checkpoints or milestones by, among other things, comparing actual  cost, schedule, and performance data with estimates in the program  plan and identifying significant deviations from established targets or  thresholds for acceptable performance levels.", "Measure and monitor agile projects on velocity (i.e., number of story  points completed per sprint or release), development progression  (e.g., the number of features and user stories planned and  accepted), product quality (e.g., number of defects), and post- deployment user satisfaction.", "To determine the extent to which DHS and the Secret Service had  implemented the first selected practice, we analyzed relevant program  management and governance documentation for IITT\u2019s Enabling  Capabilities program, and Multi-Level Security, Uniformed Division  Resource Management System, and Events Management projects. For  example, we analyzed documentation such as DHS and Secret Service  program oversight reviews. We then assessed the documentation against  the selected practice.", "To determine the extent to which the Secret Service had implemented the  second selected practice related to measuring and monitoring agile  projects on agile metrics (i.e., velocity, development progression, product  quality, and post-deployment user satisfaction), we obtained and  analyzed agile-related documentation for the two projects that the Secret  Service was implementing using an agile methodology\u2014Uniformed  Division Resource Management System and Events Management.  Specifically, to determine the extent to which the Secret Service was  measuring and monitoring these two projects on metrics for velocity and  development progression, we obtained and analyzed documentation,  such as sprint burndown charts and monthly program status reports, and  compared it to the selected practice.", "In addition, the agile metrics for product quality and post-deployment user  satisfaction were only applicable to projects that had been deployed to  users. As such, these metrics were applicable to the Uniformed Division  Resource Management System (which the Secret Service had deployed  to users) and were not applicable to Events Management (which the  Secret Service had not yet deployed to users, as of early May 2018).", "We therefore obtained and analyzed documentation demonstrating that  Secret Service OCIO measured product defects for the Uniformed  Division Resource Management System. We also requested  documentation demonstrating that OCIO had measured and monitored  post-deployment user satisfaction for this project.

These  levels then determine the extent of required program and project  management and the acquisition decision authority (the individual  responsible for management and oversight of the acquisition). The  department also categorizes its acquisition programs as major or non- major based on expected cost. Table 1 describes the levels of DHS\u2019s  acquisition programs and their associated acquisition decision authorities.", "DHS\u2019s policies and processes for managing major acquisition programs  are primarily set forth in its Acquisition Management Directive 102-01 and  Acquisition Management Instruction 102-01-001. In particular, these  policies establish that a major acquisition program\u2019s decision authority is  to review the program at a series of predetermined acquisition decision  events to assess whether the program is ready to proceed through the  acquisition life cycle phases. Figure 1 depicts the acquisition life cycle  established in DHS acquisition management policy.", "DHS\u2019s Acquisition Management Directive and Instruction do not establish  an acquisition life cycle framework for the department\u2019s non-major  acquisition programs. Instead, according to the Instruction, Component  Acquisition Executives (i.e., the senior acquisition official within a  component that is responsible for implementation, management, and  oversight of the component\u2019s acquisition process) are required to  establish component-specific non-major acquisition policies and guidance  that support the \u201cspirit and intent\u201d of the department\u2019s acquisition policies.", "To that end, the Secret Service developed a policy that establishes an  acquisition life cycle framework for its non-major acquisition programs.  This acquisition framework for the component\u2019s non-major acquisition  programs is consistent with the acquisition framework that DHS  established for its major acquisition programs. In particular, the Secret  Service\u2019s framework includes the same phases and decision events as  DHS\u2019s framework (e.g., acquisition decision event 2A, the point at which  the acquisition decision authority determines whether a program may  proceed into the obtain phase).", "In addition, DHS\u2019s Systems Engineering Life Cycle Instruction and  Guidebook outline a framework of major systems engineering activities  and technical reviews that are to be conducted by all DHS programs and  projects, both major and non-major. This framework is intended to  ensure that appropriate systems engineering activities are planned and  implemented, and that a program\u2019s development effort is meeting the  business need.", "In particular, the systems engineering life cycle framework consists of  nine major activities (e.g., requirements definition, integration, and  testing) and a set of related technical reviews (e.g., preliminary design  review) and artifacts (e.g., requirements documents). DHS policy allows  programs to tailor these activities, technical reviews, and artifacts based  on the unique characteristics of the program (e.g., scope, complexity, and  risk). For example, a program may combine systems engineering  technical reviews and artifacts, or add additional reviews. This tailored  approach must be documented in a program\u2019s systems engineering life  cycle tailoring plan.", "The systems engineering technical reviews are intended to provide DHS  the opportunity to determine how well a program has completed the  necessary systems engineering activities. Each technical review includes  a minimum set of exit criteria that must be satisfied before a program may  move on to the next systems engineering activity. At the end of the  technical review, the program manager must develop a technical review  completion letter that documents the outcome of the review, including  stakeholder concurrence that the exit criteria were satisfied.", "Moreover, DHS\u2019s agile instruction, which was first issued in April 2016  and updated in April 2018, identifies agile as the preferred development  approach for the department\u2019s IT programs and projects. Agile is a type  of incremental (i.e., modular) development, which calls for the rapid  delivery of software in small, short increments rather than in the typically  long, sequential phases of a traditional waterfall approach. DHS\u2019s agile  instruction also states that component CIOs are to set modular (i.e.,  incremental) outcomes and target measures to monitor progress in  achieving agile implementation for IT programs and projects. To that end,  the department identified core metrics that its agile IT programs are to  use to monitor progress, including the number of story points completed  per release and the number of releases per quarter.", "Further, DHS policy and guidance have established an acquisition (i.e.,  contract) review process that is intended to enable the DHS CIO to review  and effectively guide the department\u2019s IT expenditures.

In addition, another Secret Service  CIO appointee\u2014the component\u2019s Chief Architect\u2014attended an ad  hoc meeting of the Enterprise Architecture Board in June 2017.", "In addition, the Secret Service CIO had partially implemented three  component-level CIO responsibilities, as follows.", "Manage the component IT investment portfolio, including  establishing a component-level IT acquisition review process  that enables component and DHS review of component  acquisitions (i.e., contracts) that contain IT. As directed in DHS\u2019s  Capital Planning and Investment Control directive and guidebook, the  Secret Service CIO took steps to manage the component\u2019s IT  investment portfolio, including reviewing certain contracts containing  IT. For example, among our random sample of 33 IT contracts that  the Secret Service awarded between October 1, 2016, and June 30,  2017, we found that the CIO or the CIO\u2019s delegate had reviewed 31 of  these contracts.", "However, the CIO had not established and documented a defined  process for reviewing contracts containing IT, which may have  contributed to why the CIO or the CIO\u2019s delegate did not review 2 of  the 33 contracts in our sample. OCIO officials were unable to explain  why neither of these officials reviewed the 2 contracts, which had a  combined planned total procurement value of approximately $1.75  million. In particular, one of the contracts, with a planned total  procurement value of about $1,122,934, was to provide credentialing  services for the 2017 Presidential Inauguration. The other contract,  with a planned total procurement value of about $629,337, was to  provide maintenance support for a logistics system. The OCIO  officials acknowledged that both contracts should have been  approved by one of these officials. Without establishing and  documenting an IT acquisition review process that ensures that the  CIO or the CIO\u2019s delegate reviews all contracts containing IT, as  appropriate, the CIO\u2019s ability to analyze the contracts to ensure that  they are a cost-effective use of resources and are aligned with the  component\u2019s missions and goals is limited.", "Ensure all component IT policies are in compliance and  alignment with DHS IT directives and instructions. As required by  DHS\u2019s IT Integration and Management directive, the Secret Service  CIO had ensured that certain component IT policies were in  compliance and alignment with DHS IT directives and instructions. For  example, in alignment with the department\u2019s IT Integration and  Management directive, the Secret Service\u2019s Investment Governance  for IT policy specifies that the component CIO (in conjunction with  each Secret Service Office) is responsible for developing the  component IT spend plan, as well as developing and maintaining an  IT strategic plan.", "However, the Secret Service\u2019s enterprise governance policy was not  in compliance with DHS\u2019s IT Integration and Management directive.

However, the Secret  Service\u2019s enterprise governance policy has not been updated to  reflect these roles. The Secret Service did not update its enterprise  governance policy to properly reflect the CIO\u2019s and Deputy CIO\u2019s  roles on the Executive Resources Board or Enterprise Governance  Council because OCIO officials were not aware that these roles were  not properly documented in the component\u2019s policy until we identified  this issue during our review.", "Further compounding the issue of the Secret Service\u2019s enterprise  governance policy not properly reflecting the CIO\u2019s and Deputy CIO\u2019s  roles and responsibilities on the component\u2019s governance boards is  that the Secret Service has not developed a charter for its Executive  Resources Board. We have previously reported that a best practice  for effective investment management is to define and document the  board\u2019s membership, roles, and responsibilities. One such way to do  so is via a charter.", "According to Secret Service officials, the component does not have a  charter for the board because, while the Secret Service has  established the board pursuant to law, there is little statutory guidance  on how the board must be formalized, including whether a charter is  required.

Further, until the Secret Service develops a charter for its  Executive Resources Board that specifies the roles and  responsibilities of all board members, including the CIO, the Secret  Service will not be effectively positioned to ensure that all members  understand their roles and responsibilities on the board and will  perform them as expected.", "Set modular outcomes and target measures to monitor the  progress in achieving agile implementation for IT programs  and/or projects within their component. Consistent with DHS  policy, the Secret Service CIO has set modular outcomes and target  measures to monitor the progress of two IITT projects that the  component is implementing using an agile methodology\u2014Uniformed  Division Resource Management System and Events Management.  For example, the modular outcomes set for these projects included  measuring planned and actual burndown (i.e., the number of user  stories completed). In addition, the projects were to measure their  velocity (i.e., the rate of work completed) for each sprint (i.e., a set  period of time during which the development team is expected to  complete tasks related to developing a piece of working software).", "However, the modular outcomes and target measures did not include  product quality or post-deployment user satisfaction, although such  measures are leading practices for managing agile projects.  According to Secret Service OCIO officials, the component does not  mandate the specific metrics that its agile projects are to use; instead,  each project is to determine the metrics based on stakeholder  requirements and unique project characteristics. The officials further  stated that these metrics are to be documented in an acquisition  program baseline and program management plan; this baseline and  program management plan are then to be approved by the CIO. To its  credit, the component\u2019s one agile project that, as of May 2018, had  deployed its system to users\u2014the Uniformed Division Resource  Management System\u2014did measure product quality. OCIO officials  also stated that they regularly receive verbal, undocumented feedback  from users on the system and they plan to conduct a documented  user satisfaction survey on this system by September 2018.", "Nevertheless, without ensuring that product quality and post- deployment user satisfaction metrics are included in the modular  outcomes and target measures that the CIO sets for monitoring agile  projects, the Secret Service lacks assurance that the Events  Management project or other future agile projects will measure  product quality or post-deployment user satisfaction.

In addition,  because OCIO officials were unable to specify a time frame for when  they will identify all of the technical competency needs for the IT  workforce (as previously discussed), the officials were also unable to  specify a time frame for when they would update the IT workforce\u2019s  performance plans to include those relevant technical competencies.", "Until OCIO updates the performance plans for each occupational  series within the IT workforce to include the relevant technical  competencies, once identified, against which IT staff performance  should be assessed, the office will be limited in its ability to provide IT  staff with a complete assessment of their performance. In addition,  Secret Service management will have limited knowledge of the extent  to which IT staff are meeting all relevant technical competencies.", "Explicitly align individual performance expectations with  organizational goals to help individuals see the connection  between their daily activities and organizational goals\u2014partly  implemented. The Secret Service\u2019s performance plans for IT staff  identified certain goals that appeared to be related to organizational  goals and objectives. For example, the performance plan for the  Telecommunications Specialist occupational series (which is one of  the series included in OCIO\u2019s IT workforce) identified a goal for staff to  support the voice, wireless, radio, satellite, and video systems serving  the Secret Service\u2019s protective and investigative mission. This  performance plan goal appeared to be related to the component\u2019s  strategic goal on Advanced Technology, which included an objective  to create the infrastructure needed to fulfill mission responsibilities.", "However, the Secret Service was unable to provide documentation  that explicitly showed how individual employee performance links to  organizational goals, such as a mapping of the goals identified in  employee performance plans to organizational goals. Specifically,  while Office of Human Resources officials stated that each Secret  Service directorate is responsible for ensuring that employee goals  map to high-level organizational goals, OCIO officials stated that they  did not complete this mapping. The officials were unable to explain  why they did not align the goals in their employees\u2019 performance  plans to the component\u2019s high-level goals.", "According to the officials, the Secret Service is in the process of  implementing a new automated tool that will require each office to  explicitly align individual performance expectations to organizational  goals. The officials stated that OCIO plans to use this tool to create  employees\u2019 fiscal year 2019 performance plans. By explicitly  demonstrating how individual performance expectations align with  organizational goals, the Secret Service\u2019s IT staff should have a better  understanding of how their daily activities contribute towards  achieving the Secret Service\u2019s goals.", "Periodically provide individuals with regular performance  feedback\u2014fully implemented. Secret Service leadership periodically  provided their IT staff with performance feedback. Specifically, on an  annual basis, OCIO staff received feedback during a mid-year and  end-of-year performance feedback assessment. In our prior work, we  have stressed that candid and constructive feedback can help  individuals maximize their contribution and potential for understanding  and realizing the goals and objectives of an organization.

According to the Institute, agile development methods focus on  delivering usable, working software frequently; as such, it is important to  measure the value delivered during each iteration of these projects. To  that end, the Institute reported that agile projects should be measured on  velocity (i.e., number of story points completed per sprint or release),  development progression (e.g., the number of user stories planned and  accepted), product quality (e.g., number of defects), and post-deployment  user satisfaction.", "DHS and the Secret Service had fully implemented the selected leading  practice for monitoring the performance of one program and three  projects within the IITT investment, and conducting reviews of this  program and these projects at predetermined checkpoints.

In particular, the Enabling Capabilities program informed DHS that  the program needed to change the planned date for acquisition  decision event 3 (the point at which a decision is made to fully  deploy the system) in order to conduct tests in an operational  environment prior to that decision event. This delay was due to the  Secret Service misunderstanding the tests that it was required to  conduct prior to that decision event.

Tracking such metrics and reporting the results to Secret Service  leadership, as we recommended, would provide management with  important information necessary to make effective recruitment decisions.", "Further, in response to recommendation 10, which among other things,  calls for the CIO to define the required training for each IT workforce  group, the department stated that the Secret Service OCIO recently  developed training requirements for each workforce group, which were  issued during our audit. However, while during our audit OCIO provided a  list of recommended training courses, the office did not identify them as  being required courses.

From the list of 33 responsibilities that we identified, we  then excluded the responsibility that was associated with information  security, which is expected to be addressed as part of a separate,  subsequent GAO review. We also excluded those responsibilities that  were significantly large in scope (e.g., implement an enterprise  architecture) or that, in our professional judgment, lacked specificity (e.g.,  provide timely delivery of mission IT services).

Secret Service officials subsequently confirmed that these three items  were not contracts. We therefore removed these three items from the list.  As such, the final list of validated contracts identified by the Secret  Service included 46 IT contracts.", "In addition, to identify any IT contracts that were not included in the list  provided by the Secret Service, we conducted a search of the Federal  Procurement Data System \u2013 Next Generation to identify all unclassified  contracts that (1) the component awarded between October 1, 2016, and  June 30, 2017; (2) were not a modification of a contract; and (3) were  associated with 1 of the 79 IT product or service codes identified by the  Category Management Leadership Council. Based on these criteria, we  identified 144 Secret Service IT contracts in the Federal Procurement  Data System \u2013 Next Generation (these 144 contracts included the 46  contracts previously identified by Secret Service officials). We then asked  Secret Service officials to validate the accuracy, completeness, and  reliability of these data, which they did.", "From each of these two lists of IT contracts (i.e., the list of 46 IT contracts  identified by the Secret Service and the list of 144 IT contracts that we  identified from the Federal Procurement Data System \u2013 Next Generation),  we then selected random, non-generalizable samples of contracts, as  described below.", "First, from the list of 46 IT contracts identified by Secret Service  officials, we removed 4 contracts that had total values of less than  $10,000.

We separated the  contracts into the three cost ranges identified above in order to ensure  that contracts of different value levels had been selected. This enabled us  to determine the extent to which the CIO appropriately reviewed contracts  of all values.", "To determine the extent to which the CIO had established an IT contract  approval process that enabled the Secret Service and DHS, as  appropriate, to review IT contracts, we first asked Secret Service Office of  the CIO (OCIO) officials for documentation of their IT contract approval  process.

Further, the officials stated that, in  accordance with DHS\u2019s October 2016 IT acquisition review guidance,  they submitted to DHS OCIO for approval any IT contracts that met  DHS\u2019s thresholds for review, including those that (1) had total estimated  procurement values of $2.5 million or more, and (2) were associated with  a major investment.", "Based on the IT acquisition review process that Secret Service OCIO  officials described, we then obtained and analyzed each of the 33  selected IT contracts and associated approval documentation to  determine whether or not the Secret Service CIO or the CIO\u2019s delegate  had approved each of the contracts. In particular, we (1) reviewed the  name of the contract approver on the approval documentation, and (2)  compared the signature dates that were on the contracts to the signature  dates that were identified on the associated approval documentation.", "In addition, to determine whether or not the Secret Service CIO submitted  to DHS OCIO for approval the IT contracts that (1) had total estimated  procurement values of $2.5 million or more, and (2) were associated with  major investments, we first analyzed the 144 Secret Service IT contracts  that we had previously pulled from the Federal Procurement Data System  \u2013 Next Generation to determine which contracts met the $2.5 million  threshold. We identified 4 contracts that met this threshold. We then  requested that OCIO identify the levels (i.e., major or non-major) of the  investments associated with these contracts. According to OCIO officials,  3 of the 4 contracts were associated with non-major investments and 1  was not associated with an investment. As such, based on DHS\u2019s  October 2016 IT acquisition review guidance, none of these contracts  needed to be submitted to DHS OCIO for review.", "We also interviewed Secret Service officials, including the CIO and  Deputy CIO, regarding the CIO\u2019s implementation of the 14 selected  component-level responsibilities. We assessed the evidence against the  selected responsibilities to determine the extent to which the CIO had  implemented them.", "To address the second objective\u2014determining the extent to which the  Secret Service had implemented leading workforce planning and  management practices for its IT workforce\u2014we first identified seven  topic areas associated with human capital management based on the  following sources:", "The Office of Personnel Management\u2019s Human Capital Framework.", "Office of Personnel Management and the Chief Human Capital  Officers Council Subcommittee for Hiring and Succession Planning,  End-to-End Hiring Initiative.", "GAO, High-Risk Series: Progress on Many High-Risk Areas, While  Substantial Efforts Needed on Others.", "GAO, IT Workforce: Key Practices Help Ensure Strong Integrated  Program Teams; Selected Departments Need to Assess Skill Gaps.", "GAO, Department of Homeland Security: Taking Further Action to  Better Determine Causes of Morale Problems Would Assist in  Targeting Action Plans.", "GAO, Human Capital: A Guide for Assessing Strategic Training and  Development Efforts in the Federal Government.", "GAO, Results-Oriented Cultures: Creating a Clear Linkage between  Individual Performance and Organizational Success.", "DHS acquisition guidance.", "Secret Service acquisition guidance.", "Among these topic areas, we then selected five areas that, in our  professional judgment, were of particular importance to successful  workforce planning and management.

The selected practices were  foundational practices that, in our professional judgment, were of  particular importance to successful workforce planning and management.", "Table 14 identifies the five selected workforce areas and 15 selected  associated practices.", "To determine the extent to which the Secret Service had implemented the  selected leading workforce planning and management practices for its IT  workforce, we obtained and assessed documentation and compared it  against the 15 selected practices. In particular, we analyzed the Secret  Service\u2019s human capital strategic plan, human capital staffing plan, IT  strategic plan, documentation of the component\u2019s staffing model that it  used to determine the number of IT staff needed, an independent  verification and validation report on the component\u2019s staffing models,  documentation of the current number of IT staff, the Secret Service\u2019s  recruitment and outreach plans, documentation of DHS\u2019s hiring  authorities (which are applicable to the Secret Service), the Secret  Service\u2019s training strategic plan, IT workforce training plan, action plans  for improving employee morale, and templates used for measuring and  reporting employee performance.", "We also interviewed Secret Service officials\u2014including the CIO, Deputy  CIO, and workforce planning staff\u2014about the component\u2019s workforce- related policies and documentation. Further, we discussed with the  officials the Secret Service\u2019s efforts to implement the selected workforce  practices for its IT workforce.", "Regarding our assessments of the Secret Service\u2019s implementation of the  15 selected workforce planning and management practices, we assessed  a practice as being fully implemented if component officials provided  supporting documentation that demonstrated all aspects of the practice.  We assessed a practice as not implemented if the officials did not provide  any supporting documentation for that practice, or if the documentation  provided did not demonstrate any aspect of the practice. We assessed a  practice as being partly implemented if the officials provided supporting  documentation that demonstrated some, but not all, aspects of the  selected practice.", "In addition, related to our assessments of the Secret Service\u2019s  implementation of the five selected overall workforce areas, we assessed  each area as follows, based on the implementation of the three selected  practices within each area:", "Fully implemented: The Secret Service provided evidence that it had  fully implemented all three of the selected practices within the  workforce area;", "Substantially implemented: The Secret Service provided evidence that  it had either  fully implemented two selected practices and partly implemented  the remaining one selected practice within the workforce area, or  fully implemented one selected practice and partly implemented  the remaining two selected practices within the workforce area;", "Partially implemented: The Secret Service provided evidence that it  had partly implemented each of the three selected practices within the  workforce area;", "Minimally implemented: The Secret Service provided evidence that it partly implemented two selected practices and not implemented  the remaining one selected practice within the workforce area, or partly implemented one selected practice and not implemented  the remaining two selected practices within the workforce area; or", "Not implemented: The Secret Service did not provide evidence that it  had implemented any of the three selected practices within the  workforce area.", "To address the third objective\u2014determining the extent to which the  Secret Service and DHS have implemented selected performance and  progress monitoring practices for IITT\u2014we reviewed leading project  monitoring practices and guidance from the Software Engineering  Institute. First, we reviewed the practices within the Project Monitoring  and Control process area of the Institute\u2019s Capability Maturity Model  Integration\u00ae for Acquisition. Based on our review, we identified four  practices associated with monitoring program performance and progress.  In our professional judgment, all four of these practices were of  significance to managing the IITT investment given the phase of the life  cycle that the investment was in. As such, we elected to include all four of  these practices in our review, and combined them into one practice, as  follows:", "Monitor program performance and conduct reviews at predetermined  checkpoints or milestones by, among other things, comparing actual  cost, schedule, and performance data with estimates in the program  plan and identifying significant deviations from established targets or  thresholds for acceptable performance levels.", "Next, given the agile development methodology that the Secret Service  was using for certain projects within IITT, we reviewed the Software  Engineering Institute\u2019s technical note on the progress monitoring of agile  contractors. Based on our review, and in consultation with an internal  expert, we selected four agile metrics that the Institute identified as  important for successful agile implementations and that, in our  professional judgment, were of most significance to monitoring the  performance of IITT\u2019s agile projects. We then combined these four  metrics into one practice, as follows:", "Measure and monitor agile projects on velocity (i.e., number of story  points completed per sprint or release), development progression  (e.g., the number of features and user stories planned and accepted),  product quality (e.g., number of defects), and post-deployment user  satisfaction.", "To determine the extent to which DHS and the Secret Service had  implemented the first selected practice, we analyzed relevant program  management and governance documentation for IITT\u2019s Enabling  Capabilities program, and Multi-Level Security, Uniformed Division  Resource Management System, and Events Management projects. In  particular, we analyzed acquisition program baselines, DHS acquisition  decision event memorandums, artifacts from DHS and Secret Service  program oversight reviews, cost monitoring reports, program integrated  master schedules, and program status briefings, and compared this  documentation to the selected practice. We also interviewed Secret  Service OCIO officials regarding the Secret Service\u2019s and DHS\u2019s efforts to  monitor the IITT investment\u2019s performance and progress.", "To determine the extent to which the Secret Service had implemented the  second selected practice related to measuring and monitoring agile  projects on agile metrics (i.e., velocity, development progression, product  quality, and post-deployment user satisfaction), we obtained and  analyzed agile-related documentation for the two projects that the Secret  Service was implementing using an agile methodology\u2014Uniformed  Division Resource Management System and Events Management.  Specifically, to determine the extent to which the Secret Service was  measuring and monitoring these two projects on metrics for velocity and  development progression, we obtained and analyzed documentation,  such as sprint burndown charts and monthly program status reports, and  compared it to the selected practice.", "In addition, the agile metrics for product quality and post-deployment user  satisfaction were only applicable to projects that had been deployed to  users. As such, these metrics were applicable to the Uniformed Division  Resource Management System (which the Secret Service had deployed  to users) and were not applicable to Events Management (which the  Secret Service had not yet deployed to users, as of early May 2018).", "We therefore obtained and analyzed documentation demonstrating that  Secret Service OCIO measured product defects for the Uniformed  Division Resource Management System. We also requested  documentation demonstrating that OCIO had measured and monitored  post-deployment user satisfaction for this project, including via a survey.  OCIO officials stated that they had not conducted such a survey and were  unable to provide documentation demonstrating they had measured post- deployment user satisfaction for the Uniformed Division Resource  Management System.", "To assess the reliability of the cost, schedule, and agile-related data that  were in DHS and the Secret Service\u2019s program management and  governance documentation for the IITT investment, we (1) analyzed  related documentation and assessed the data against existing agency  records to identify consistency in the information, and (2) examined the  data for obvious outliers, incomplete, or unusual entries. We determined  that the data in these documents were sufficiently reliable for our  purpose, which was to evaluate the extent to which DHS and the Secret  Service had implemented processes for monitoring the IITT investment\u2019s  performance and progress.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2017 to November 2018  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
