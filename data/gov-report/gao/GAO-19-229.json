GAO's analysis of Navy maintenance data shows that between fiscal year 2008 and 2018, attack submarines have incurred 10,363 days of idle time and maintenance delays as a result of delays in getting into and out of the shipyards. For example, the Navy originally scheduled the USS Boise to enter a shipyard for an extended maintenance period in 2013 but, due to heavy shipyard workload, the Navy delayed the start of the maintenance period. In June 2016, the USS Boise could no longer conduct normal operations and the boat has remained idle, pierside for over two years since then waiting to enter a shipyard (see figure). GAO estimated that since fiscal year 2008 the Navy has spent more than $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2018 constant dollars to support attack submarines that provide no operational capability\u2014those sitting idle while waiting to enter the shipyards, and those delayed in completing their maintenance at the shipyards.", "The Navy has started to address challenges related to workforce shortages and facilities needs at the public shipyards. However, it has not effectively allocated maintenance periods among public shipyards and private shipyards that may also be available to help minimize attack submarine idle time. GAO's analysis found that while the public shipyards have operated above capacity for the past several years, attack submarine maintenance delays are getting longer and idle time is increasing. The Navy may have options to mitigate this idle time and maintenance delays by leveraging private shipyard capacity for repair work. But the Navy has not completed a comprehensive business case analysis as recommended by Department of Defense guidelines to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards. Navy leadership has acknowledged that they need to be more proactive in leveraging potential private shipyard repair capacity. Without addressing this challenge, the Navy risks continued expenditure of operating and support funding to crew, maintain, and support attack submarines that provide no operational capability because they are delayed in getting into and out of maintenance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Navy conduct a business case analysis to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards.

Each of the military services is  generally smaller and less combat-ready today than it has been in many  years. We reported in May 2016 that the Navy faced significant  challenges in rebuilding readiness, with maintenance delays limiting the  ability of Navy forces to surge to respond to unforeseen crises or           contingencies. In August 2018, we reported that as the military services  take steps to rebuild the readiness of their forces, they continue to be  challenged by a demand for forces that, at times, outpaces the available  supply.

We determined  maintenance delays by identifying the elapsed time between the expected  completion date and the actual completion date; and we determined idle  periods by identifying the length of time during which a submarine  awaiting maintenance was unable to conduct normal operations. We also  determined the total amount of time for which a submarine was  unavailable due to actual maintenance and idle time. To estimate costs  associated with maintenance delays and idle time, we calculated average  daily cost factors using data from the Navy\u2019s Visibility and Management of  Operating and Support Costs system. We also interviewed Navy fleet and  squadron officials, submarine crews, and shipyard officials to understand  factors affecting operational availability.", "For our second objective, we reviewed the Navy\u2019s plans to mitigate any  maintenance delay challenges and interviewed Navy headquarters, fleet,  and squadron officials, as well as public and private shipyard officials, to  discuss these plans.

Attack submarines are homeported at bases in the United States:  in New London, Connecticut; Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; Norfolk, Virginia; San  Diego, California; and Bangor, Washington; 4 are homeported overseas,  in the U.S. territory of Guam.", "Submarine Safety Controls and Culture  On April 10, 1963, the USS Thresher (SSN  593) sank during deep submergence tests off  the coast of New England. One hundred and  twelve officers and enlisted sailors and 17  civilians perished in the tragedy. The accident  investigation concluded that the Navy did not  have adequate procedures in place to prevent  and respond to a catastrophic flooding  incident. time, and that maintenance delays reduce the amount of time during  which ships and submarines are available for training and operations.", "Submarine fleet and squadron officials emphasized the strict safety  culture that permeates the submarine community. This emphasis on  meeting safety certification criteria means that the Navy operates a  supply-based submarine force that does not compromise on adherence to  training and maintenance standards to meet combatant commander  demands, according to these officials (see sidebar). Officials added that  the Navy will delay deployment dates if necessary to ensure that these  standards are met. As a result, deployed readiness is high and attack  submarines are in excellent materiel condition as compared with the rest  of the Navy fleet.", "The loss of the USS Thresher and its crew  spurred the Navy to establish stringent safety  requirements for submarines to prevent  another loss at sea. Following the accident,  the Navy established submarine safety  certification criteria to provide maximum  reasonable assurance that critical systems  would protect the crew from flooding and  allow the submarine to conduct an emergency  surfacing should flooding occur. This  program, known as SUBSAFE, is still in use  today, to ensure that these critical systems  receive a high quality of work and that all  work is properly documented. According to  the Navy, the SUBSAFE certification status of  a submarine is fundamental to its mission  capability, as it provides a thorough and  systematic approach to quality, and to a  culture that permeates the entire submarine  community. According to Navy officials, since  the SUBSAFE program was established in  1963, no SUBSAFE-certified submarine has  ever been lost.", "The Navy has been unable to begin or complete the vast majority of its  attack submarine maintenance periods on time resulting in significant  maintenance delays and operating and support cost expenditures. Our  analysis of Navy maintenance data shows that between fiscal year 2008  and the end of fiscal year 2018, attack submarines will have incurred  10,363 days of idle time and maintenance delays as a result of delays in  getting into and out of the shipyards.", "Our analysis found that the primary driver affecting attack submarines are  delays in completing depot maintenance. For example, of the 10,363 total  days of lost time since fiscal year 2008, 8,472 (82 percent) were due to  depot maintenance delays. As we previously reported, completing ship  and submarine maintenance on time is essential to Navy readiness, as  maintenance periods lasting longer than planned could reduce the  number of days during which ships and crews are available for training or  operations.", "Attack submarines also face delays in beginning maintenance when the  public shipyards have no available capacity, in some cases forcing  submarines to idle pierside because they are no longer certified to  conduct normal operations. According to Navy officials, the SUBSAFE  program\u2014its program to ensure and certify submarine safety\u2014requires  submarines to adhere to strict maintenance schedules and pass materiel  condition assessments before they are allowed to submerge. Attack  submarines that go too long without receiving required maintenance are  at risk of having their materiel certification expire. Should this certification  expire, these submarines are restricted to sitting idle, pierside, while they  wait until a shipyard has the capacity to begin their maintenance period  (see fig. 2).", "We found that since fiscal year 2008, 14 attack submarines have spent a  combined 61 months (1,891 days) idling while waiting to enter shipyards  for maintenance. Idle time incurred while waiting to begin a maintenance  period is often coupled with maintenance delays while at the shipyards,  thus compounding total delays.", "We also found that the Navy incurs significant costs in operating and  supporting submarines that are experiencing maintenance delays and idle  time. We analyzed the operating and support costs the Navy incurs on  average to estimate the costs of crewing, maintaining, and supporting  attack submarines that are delayed in getting into and out of the  shipyards. Using historical daily cost data the Navy adjusted for inflation,  we estimated that since fiscal year 2008 the Navy has spent more than  $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2018 constant dollars on attack submarines  sitting idle while waiting to enter the shipyards, and on those delayed in  completing their maintenance at the shipyards (see table 1). While the  Navy would incur these costs regardless of whether the submarine was  delayed, idled, or deployed, our estimate of $1.5 billion represents costs  incurred from fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2018 for attack  submarines without receiving any operational capability in return. While  acknowledging the magnitude of these costs, Navy officials stated that  there may be some benefits that could be realized from these operating  and support costs since crews on idle attack submarines can conduct  some limited training.", "Operating and support costs include payment of crew salaries,  purchasing of spare parts, and conducting of maintenance, among other  things, but they do not represent the full operational impact incurred by  the Navy from the idle time and maintenance delays. For example, attack  submarine depot-level maintenance requires the use of a drydock, and  officials from the three public shipyards we visited told us that their  drydock capacity was limited. A delayed attack submarine maintenance  period can restrict the use of a drydock for much longer than originally  anticipated, thereby preventing the shipyard from using that drydock to  maintain other vessels, including other types of ships, or to conduct  necessary repairs on the facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Navy Has Begun to Address Some Challenges Associated with Attack Submarine Maintenance Delays but Has Not Effectively Allocated Maintenance Periods to Limit Idle Time", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Navy Is Addressing Some Challenges at the Public Shipyards", "paragraphs": ["The Navy has started to address workforce shortages and facilities needs  at the public shipyards. These efforts to address the Navy\u2019s maintenance  challenges are important steps, but they will require several years of  sustained management attention to reach fruition.

According to Navy officials, all  of these issues continue to affect the Navy\u2019s ability to complete attack  submarine maintenance on time. According to officials, the Navy has  begun to address some of these challenges. For example:", "The public shipyards have been hiring to address workforce  shortages. The number of civilian full-time employees at the  shipyards increased from 25,087 in 2007 to 34,160 in 2017, with a  goal to reach 36,100 by 2020. Navy officials cautioned that this newly  hired workforce is largely inexperienced and will require time to attain  full proficiency.", "The Navy has released a plan to guide public shipyard capital  investments. In September 2017 we reported that the Navy projected  an inability to support 50 planned submarine maintenance periods  over the ensuing 23 years, due to capacity and capability shortfalls at  the public shipyards. We recommended that the Navy develop a  comprehensive plan for shipyard capital investment. In February  2018 the Navy published its shipyard optimization plan, outlining an  estimated $21 billion investment needed to address shipyard facility  and equipment needs over 20 years to meet the operational needs of  the current Navy fleet, but not the larger fleet size planned for the  future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Navy Has Not Effectively Allocated Maintenance Periods among the Public and Private Shipyards to Limit Attack Submarine Idle Time", "paragraphs": ["While the public shipyards have operated above capacity for the past  several years, attack submarine maintenance delays are getting longer  and idle time is increasing.

For example, officials at the private shipyards\u2014General Dynamics  Electric Boat and Huntington Ingalls Industries-Newport News  Shipbuilding\u2014told us that they will have available capacity for repair work  for at least the next 5 years. Although the Navy has shifted about 8  million man-hours in attack submarine maintenance to private shipyards  over the past 5 years, it has done so sporadically, having decided to do  so in some cases only after experiencing lengthy periods of idle time.  According to private shipyard officials, the sporadic shifts in workload  have resulted in repair workload gaps that have disrupted private  shipyard workforce, performance, and capital investment\u2014creating costs  that are ultimately borne in part by the Navy.", "We believe that the Navy has not fully mitigated this challenge because it  has not completed a comprehensive business case analysis to inform  maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards, and  to proactively minimize attack submarine idle time and maintenance  delays. Such an analysis would help the Navy better assess private  shipyard capacity to perform attack submarine maintenance and would  help it incorporate a complete accounting of all costs, benefits, and risks,  including:  the large operating and support costs of having attack submarines  sitting idle;  the qualitative benefits associated with providing additional availability  to the combatant commanders; and  the potential for additional work at private shipyards to reduce  schedule risk to submarine construction programs by allowing the  yards to build and maintain a stable shipyard workforce.", "The April 2011 DOD Product Support Business Case Analysis Guidebook  provides standards for DOD\u2019s process for conducting analyses of costs,  benefits, and risks.

It notes that benefits, such as the  availability of a weapon system, may be qualitative in nature, and that  DOD should evaluate all possible support options, to include government-  and contractor-provided maintenance. Navy leadership has  acknowledged that they need to be more proactive in leveraging private  shipyard repair capacity, but officials cautioned that maintenance could  cost more at a private shipyard than at a public shipyard. However,  without a complete accounting of all costs, benefits, and risks, the Navy  will remain unable to determine whether the cost of performing a  maintenance period at a private shipyard would outweigh the mission  benefits of having reduced idle time, additional operational availability,  and the potential for reduced risk to submarine construction programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The nation\u2019s investment in attack submarines provides the United States  an asymmetric advantage to gather intelligence undetected, attack enemy  targets, and insert special forces, among other capabilities.

The Navy determines depot maintenance delays by counting  each day in which a submarine maintenance period extends beyond the  planned completion date. Two Navy offices within Naval Sea Systems  Command\u2014that is, the Logistics, Maintenance, and Industrial Operations  office and Program Executive Office Submarines\u2014track days incurred  from depot-level maintenance delays and idle time. To determine the total  number of days of maintenance delays for each fiscal year within our  scope, we subtracted the planned completion date from the actual  completion date to produce the number of days of maintenance delays for  each maintenance period for each submarine. We added together the  days of maintenance delays across all attack submarines for each fiscal  year, and then added the fiscal year totals to produce the overall total.  Although the data included some maintenance periods that began before  fiscal year 2008, we counted days of maintenance delays only from  periods that were incurred in fiscal years 2008 through 2018. We also  tracked the total number of days that the Navy completed maintenance  periods ahead of schedule\u2014that is, 153\u2014but we noted these separately  instead of subtracting them from the total number of days of maintenance  delays.", "To estimate costs associated with these delays, we analyzed annual data  from fiscal years 2011 through 2017 (the most current data available at  the time of our review) from the Navy\u2019s Visibility and Management of  Operating and Support Costs system. We also reviewed prior work on  determining the operating and support costs of Navy ships. The Navy  calculates total operating and support expenditures for each attack  submarine on an annual basis, as well as the yearly average expenditure  for each attack submarine class, including Los Angeles class, Seawolf  class, and Virginia class blocks one and two. For each class, we  converted the Navy\u2019s annual class averages into daily average costs by  adding the annual class averages together for each year that data were  available, fiscal years 2011 through 2017, then dividing that number by  the total number of days. We then multiplied the daily class average by  the total number of days of maintenance delays and idle time incurred by  submarines within that class, according to our calculations outlined  above, between fiscal year 2008 and fiscal year 2018, and we added  these totals together to produce the total estimated operating and support  cost for days of maintenance delays and idle time incurred during this  period. The data did not include annual class average costs for fiscal  years 2008, 2009, 2010, or 2018. However, the annual class averages for  fiscal years 2011 through 2017 did not show significant variation, so we  applied these averages to 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2018.", "To assess the extent to which the Navy has addressed any challenges  and developed mitigation plans for any maintenance delays, we reviewed  the Navy\u2019s plans to address attack submarine maintenance delays and  interviewed Navy headquarters, fleet, and squadron officials, attack  submarine crews, and public and private shipyard officials to understand  any plans to address attack submarine maintenance delays and idle time.  We analyzed data on factors contributing to attack submarine  maintenance delays, such as cannibalization rates. We visited three of  the four public shipyards, including Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and  Intermediate Maintenance Facility, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, and  Norfolk Naval Shipyard, to observe operations, training, and the condition  of the facilities and equipment, and to interview officials about challenges  affecting operational efficiency and performance.
