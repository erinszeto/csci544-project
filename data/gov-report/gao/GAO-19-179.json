Withdrawals from individual retirement accounts (IRA)\u2014$39.5 billion (+/- $2.1 billion)\u2014accounted for much of the money removed early, were equivalent to 3 percent (+/- 0.15 percent) of the age group's total IRA assets, and exceeded their IRA contributions in 2013. Participants in employer-sponsored plans, like 401(k) plans, withdrew at least $29.2 billion (+/- $2.8 billion) early as hardship withdrawals, lump sum payments made at job separation (known as cashouts), and loan balances that borrowers did not repay. Hardship withdrawals in 2013 were equivalent to about 0.5 percent (+/-0.06 percent) of the age group's total plan assets and about 8 percent (+/- 0.9 percent) of their contributions. However, the incidence and amount of certain unrepaid plan loans cannot be determined because the Form 5500\u2014the federal government's primary source of information on employee benefit plans\u2014does not capture these data.", "Stakeholders GAO interviewed identified flexibilities in plan rules and individuals' pressing financial needs, such as out-of-pocket medical costs, as factors affecting early withdrawals of retirement savings. Stakeholders said that certain plan rules, such as setting high minimum loan thresholds, may cause individuals to take out more of their savings than they need. Stakeholders also identified several elements of the job separation process affecting early withdrawals, such as difficulties transferring account balances to a new plan and plans requiring the immediate repayment of outstanding loans, as relevant factors.", "Stakeholders GAO interviewed suggested strategies they believed could balance early access to accounts with the need to build long-term retirement savings. For example, plan sponsors said allowing individuals to continue to repay plan loans after job separation, restricting participant access to plan sponsor contributions, allowing partial distributions at job separation, and building emergency savings features into plan designs, could help preserve retirement savings (see figure).

First, to examine recent incidence and amounts  of IRA withdrawals and tax consequences of withdrawal, we analyzed  published statistics from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for 2013.  Second, to examine the incidence and amount of early withdrawals from  401(k) plans, we analyzed the most recently available data on individuals  collected in 2013 for the 2014 panel of the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s Survey  of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), along with its Social Security  Administration (SSA) supplement. Third, to examine the incidence and  amount of participant loans not paid back to a plan (i.e., plan loans), we  analyzed annual plan data from 2013 reported to the Department of Labor  (DOL) on the Form 5500.

In contrast, benefit levels in DC plans\u2014such as  401(k) plans\u2014depend on the contributions made to the plan and the  performance of the investments in individual accounts, which may  fluctuate in value. As we have previously reported, some experts have  suggested that the portability of DC plans make them better-suited for a  mobile workforce, and that such portability may lead to early withdrawals  of retirement savings. DOL reported there were 656,241 DC and 46,300  DB plans in the United States in 2016.", "Tax incentives are in place to encourage employers to sponsor retirement  plans and employees to participate in plans.

As plan  sponsors, employers may decide the amount of employer contributions (if  any) and how long participants must work before having a non-forfeitable  (i.e., vested) interest in their plan benefit, within limits established by  federal law. Plan sponsors often contract with service providers to  administer their plans and provide services such as record keeping (e.g.,  tracking and reporting individual account contributions); investment  management (i.e., selecting and managing the securities included in a  mutual fund); and custodial or trustee services for plan assets (e.g.,  holding the plan assets in a bank).", "Individuals also receive tax incentives to save for retirement outside of an  employer-sponsored plan. For example, traditional IRAs provide certain individuals with a way to save pre-tax money for retirement, with  withdrawals made in retirement taxed as income. In addition, Roth IRAs  allow certain individuals to save after-tax money for retirement with  withdrawals in retirement generally tax-free. IRAs were established  under ERISA, in part, to (1) provide a way for individuals not covered by a  pension plan to save for retirement; and (2) give retiring workers or  individuals changing jobs a way to preserve assets from 401(k) plans by  transferring their plan balances into IRAs. The Investment Company  Institute (ICI) reported that 34.8 percent of households in the United  States owned an IRA in 2017, a percentage that has generally remained  stable since 2000. In 2017, IRA assets accounted for almost 33 percent  (estimated at $9.2 trillion) of total U.S. retirement assets, followed by DC  plans, which accounted for 27 percent ($7.7 trillion).

We  determined that the data from these sources were sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of our report.", "First, to examine recent incidence and amount of early withdrawals  from IRAs and the associated tax consequences for individuals ages  25 to 55, we analyzed IRS estimates based on tax returns as filed by  taxpayers before enforcement activity published by the Internal  Revenue Service\u2019s (IRS) Statistics of Income Division for tax year  2013. Specifically, we analyzed the number of taxpayers reporting  early withdrawals from their IRAs in 2013 and the aggregate amount  of these withdrawals. To provide additional context on the scope of  these early withdrawals, we analyzed the age cohort\u2019s total IRA  contributions and the end-of-year fair market value of the IRAs, and  compared these amounts to the aggregate amount withdrawn. To  examine the incidence and amount of taxes paid as a result of the  additional 10 percent tax for early distributions, we analyzed estimates  on the additional 10 percent tax paid on qualified retirement plans in  2013. Although IRS did not delineate these data by age, we used  these data as proxy because IRS assesses the additional 10 percent  tax on distributions to taxpayers who have not reached age 59\u00bd.  Given the delay between a withdrawal date and the date of the tax  filing, it is possible that some of the taxes were paid in the year  following the withdrawal. We reviewed technical documentation and  developed the 95 percent confidence intervals that correspond to  these estimates.", "Second, to examine the incidence and amount of early withdrawals  from 401(k) plans, we analyzed data included in the 2014 panel of the  U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s Survey of Income and Program Participation  (SIPP)\u2014a nationally representative survey of household income,  finances, and use of federal social safety net programs\u2014along with  retirement account contribution and withdrawal data included in the  SIPP\u2019s Social Security Administration (SSA) Supplement on  Retirement, Pensions, and Related Content. Specifically, we  developed percentage and dollar-value estimates of the incidence and  amount of lump sum payments received and hardship withdrawals  taken by participants in 401(k) plans in 2013. Because the SIPP is  based upon a complex probability sample, we used Balanced  Repeated Replication methods with a Fay adjustment to derive all  percentage, dollar-total, and dollar-ratio estimates and their 95  percent confidence intervals. To better understand the characteristics  of individuals who received a lump sum and/or took a hardship  withdrawal in 2013, we analyzed a range of selected individual and  household demographic variables and identified characteristics  associated with a higher incidence of withdrawals. We applied domain  estimation methods to make estimates for these subpopulations. (For  a list of variables used and the results of our analysis, please see  appendix III.) We attempted to develop a multiple regression model to  estimate the unique association between each characteristic and  withdrawals, but determined that the SIPP did not measure key  variables in enough detail to develop persuasive causal explanations.  The sample size of respondents receiving lump sums was too small to  precisely estimate the partial correlations of many demographic  variables at once. Even with adequate sample sizes, associations  between broad demographic variables, such as age and income,  likely reflected underlying causes, such as retirement and financial  planning strategies, which SIPP did not measure in detail.", "Third, to examine the incidence and amount of unrepaid plan loans  from 401(k) plans, we analyzed the latest filing of annual plan data  that plan sponsors reported on the Form 5500 to the Department of  Labor (DOL) for the 2013 plan year.

Because  plan sponsors report data in aggregate and do not differentiate by  participant age, we calculated and reported the aggregate of loan  defaults identified as deemed distributions in both schedules. We  could not determine the amount of plan loan offsets based on the way  that plan sponsors are required to report them. Specifically, plan  sponsors are required to treat unrepaid loans occurring after a  participant separates from a plan as reductions or offsets in plan  assets, and are required to report them as part of a larger commingled  category of offsets that also includes large-dollar items like rollovers of  account balances to another qualified plan or IRA.
