The table below provides more information on settings for treating infants with NAS and on how Medicaid pays for services in these settings.", "According to stakeholders GAO interviewed and literature reviewed, there are several recommended practices and challenges associated with addressing NAS. The most frequently recommended practices included prioritizing non-pharmacologic treatment to infants\u2014treatment that does not involve medications\u2014such as allowing the mother to reside with the infant during treatment; educating mothers and health care providers on treatment of NAS, among other things; and using a protocol in the hospital or non-hospital setting for screening and treating infants with NAS. The most frequently cited challenges included the maternal use of multiple drugs\u2014or polysubstance use\u2014as it can exacerbate NAS symptoms; stigma faced by pregnant women who use opioids; hospital staff burden and limited physical capacity to care for infants with NAS; limited coordination of care for mothers and infants with NAS; and gaps in research and data on NAS, such as research on the long-term effects of the condition.", "In May 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a strategy document that makes key recommendations to address NAS. The Strategy recommends, for example, that health care providers receive continuing education on managing and treating infants with NAS and promote non-pharmacologic treatment. According to HHS officials, these recommendations will inform planning and policy across the department. However, HHS has yet to determine how and when the recommendations will be implemented, including establishing priorities; the roles and responsibilities of other federal, state, and public stakeholders; implementation timeframes; and methods for assessing progress. HHS officials told GAO that they expect to develop an implementation plan sometime in 2017 but had no timeline for doing so.

NAS is a rapidly increasing public health problem, with the incidence of  NAS in the United States growing nearly five-fold between 2000 and  2012. Specifically, cases of NAS increased from a rate of 1.2 per 1,000  hospital births per year in 2000 to 5.8 per 1,000 hospital births per year in  2012, reaching a total of 21,732 infants diagnosed with NAS. A 2015  study noted that by 2012 one infant was born about every 25 minutes with  NAS.", "While experts consider NAS to be an expected and treatable result of  prenatal opioid exposure, infants with NAS require specialized care that  typically results in longer and more complicated and costly hospital stays.

For example, the  Protecting Our Infants Act of 2015 directed the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS) to conduct a study and develop  recommendations for preventing and treating prenatal opioid use  disorders, including NAS. This law also required HHS to review its  planning and coordination related to NAS and to develop a strategy to  address gaps in research and gaps, overlap, and duplication among  federal programs to address NAS.

Prenatal opioid use occurs  when a woman, during the course of her pregnancy, uses an opioid- based medication or substance. Prenatal opioid use can take various  forms, including (1) the use of prescriptions for pain management, such  as fentanyl and oxycodone; (2) medication-assisted treatment for opioid  addiction, such as methadone and buprenorphine; (3) prescription drug  misuse or use disorder (such as using an opioid without a prescription,  using a different dosage than prescribed, or continuing to use an opioid  when it is no longer needed for pain); and (4) illicit opioid use, such as  heroin use. These types of prenatal opioid use are not mutually exclusive.  A 2014 study found that almost 22 percent of pregnant Medicaid  beneficiaries filled a prescription for an opioid during their pregnancy.  Medication-assisted treatment\u2014an approach that combines the use of  certain medications and behavioral therapy\u2014is generally considered by  HHS and medical specialty societies to be the standard of care for  treating pregnant women with opioid use disorders, depending on the  individual and her circumstances. SAMHSA and several medical  specialty societies, including the American College of Obstetricians and  Gynecologists and the American Society of Addiction Medicine, have  noted that providing medication-assisted treatment during pregnancy  prevents complications associated with illicit opioid use, encourages  prenatal care, and reduces the risk of obstetric complications. Further,  women may use multiple substances in addition to opioids during  pregnancy\u2014known as maternal polysubstance use\u2014such as tobacco,  alcohol, or anti-depressants, among others.", "GAO reported in 2015 that the gaps in efforts to address prenatal opioid use and NAS  most commonly cited by federal agency officials and experts were related to the treatment  of prenatal opioid use and NAS. Agency officials and experts said that there has not been  adequate research comparing different types of treatment approaches and that research  is needed on how best to treat a pregnant woman with an opioid use disorder so that the  treatment is most effective for the woman while offering minimal risk to the fetus. See  GAO-15-203.

There have been a few scoring tools developed to screen the infant  to determine the appropriate course of treatment. Health care providers  predominantly diagnose NAS using the Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence  Scoring Tool, which calculates a score based on a variety of central  nervous, metabolic, respiratory, and gastro-intestinal symptoms that  might be observed. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the  American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that  infants with NAS should not be initially treated with medication, known as  pharmacologic treatment. Instead, these organizations recommend  starting with non-pharmacologic treatment, which includes placing the  infant in a dark and quiet environment, swaddling, breastfeeding,  rooming-in with the mother, and providing high-calorie nutrition, among  other things. For example, rooming-in\u2014allowing the mother to reside with  the infant during the infant\u2019s treatment\u2014may have benefits, such as  helping to develop a bond between the mother and infant and to reduce  the severity of the infant\u2019s NAS symptoms.

The Medicaid program allows states to design and  implement their programs within certain federal parameters, resulting in  more than 50 distinct state-based programs. For example, states  generally determine the type and scope of services to cover, set payment  rates that different health care providers will receive for various covered  services, and pay these providers for claims submitted for services  rendered. In addition, states vary in the extent to which they enroll  beneficiaries in managed care versus delivering care through the more  traditional fee-for-service model. Under a managed care delivery model,  states typically contract with managed care plans to provide a specific set  of Medicaid-covered services to beneficiaries and pay them a set amount  per beneficiary\u2014referred to as capitation payments\u2014to provide those  services.

However, these codes could be used to bill for over 2,000  diagnoses\u2014for example, pneumonia or measles. One state official said  that while they could provide us with information on Medicaid payments  for these infants, they could not parse out the costs by diagnosis codes,  such as those related to NAS.

These providers explained that in these facilities, the infants are  placed in nursery rooms, where health care providers can monitor them  and administer and adjust their medication as needed. In addition,  nursing staff or other caregivers are responsible for providing continuous  non-pharmacologic treatment, and mothers are encouraged to visit and  continue this care. For example, health care providers told us that in  Washington, two to three infants may share a nursery room where trained  caregivers provide them with non-pharmacologic treatment. In West  Virginia, health care providers said infants are typically placed in  individual nursery rooms where nurses provide them with non- pharmacologic treatment. The rooms in the West Virginia facility are also  equipped with a rocking chair to encourage mothers to visit and provide  this care as well.

One health care provider told us that one mother, after staying overnight with  her infant, realized that she was not prepared to take care of her infant and  consequently gave up custody of the infant. Because of rooming-in, health care  providers were able to ensure that the infant was safe because the mother came to  this realization at the facility, rather than alone at home.   Although the lack of physical space at the facility currently makes it difficult to  accommodate rooming-in for the entire course of the infant\u2019s treatment, these  providers noted the importance of this practice and that they are committed to parental  involvement when treating infants with NAS at their facility.", "Figure 2 depicts nursery rooms in the neonatal withdrawal center in West  Virginia.

Additionally, these providers suggested that  because the facility does not meet the Medicaid standards required  for receiving payment for hospital inpatient, nursing, or other covered  facility services, the facility is ineligible to receive Medicaid payment  for the costs of room and board. These providers said that they  receive funding for the cost of these services through state  appropriations, foster care payments, city contracts, grants, and  private donations.", "Neonatal withdrawal center in West Virginia. State officials and  health care providers at this facility told us that West Virginia pays for  NAS services through two mechanisms, depending on whether the  infant is in foster care.

These providers said that this cost savings is in  part due to their limited staffing of nurses and their ability to leverage  specially trained caregivers to provide infants with non-pharmacologic  treatment and hands-on care, such as feeding and bathing. These  providers also said they use volunteers to help with household duties,  such as laundry and replenishing supplies.", "A health care provider from the neonatal withdrawal center in West  Virginia conducted a study that found that the average daily charges  per infant were about $400 in their facility, compared to about $2,600  in a special care nursery and $4,000 in a NICU.", "Two studies we reviewed found that inpatient-to-outpatient treatment  approaches reduced hospital costs for NAS treatment; however, these  studies were not generalizable and did not account for the duration of  treatment across the two settings.

The most frequently  recommended practices were (1) prioritizing non-pharmacologic  treatment, such as allowing the mother to reside with the infant during  treatment, to facilitate the mother-infant bond; (2) educating mothers on  prenatal care, treatment for NAS, and available resources for after an  infant\u2019s discharge; (3) educating health care providers on the stigma  faced by women who use opioids during pregnancy and on how to screen  for and treat NAS; and (4) using a protocol in a hospital or non-hospital  setting for screening and treating infants with NAS. These  recommended practices are described in more detail below.", "Volunteer programs to provide non- pharmacologic treatment for neonatal  abstinence syndrome (NAS)  Some stakeholders told us that some  hospitals have established volunteer cuddler  programs that train volunteers to help provide  some of these non-pharmacologic  treatments\u2014-namely, swaddling, feeding,  soothing, and coddling infants. However,  health care providers at some facilities noted  that volunteers are not necessarily available  during late shifts. indicated that non-pharmacologic treatment may (1) facilitate the mother- infant bond, (2) reduce the severity of NAS symptoms, (3) reduce the  need for pharmacologic treatment, and (4) reduce the length of an infant\u2019s  hospital stay. For example, two of the articles we reviewed noted that  rooming-in has been shown to help decrease the need for pharmacologic  treatment, the number of admissions to the NICU, and the length of an  infant\u2019s hospital stay. Additionally, 17 of the stakeholders we interviewed  and nine articles we reviewed recommended that mothers be allowed to  breastfeed while their infants are treated for NAS, as it helps to build a  bond between the mother and infant. Most of these articles also noted  that breastfeeding has been shown to reduce the severity of NAS.", "Educating mothers on prenatal care, treatment for NAS, and  resources for after an infant\u2019s hospital discharge. Most stakeholders  we interviewed and several of the literature articles we reviewed  recommended providing comprehensive, ongoing education to mothers  on prenatal care and treatment for NAS and on the resources that are  available after an infant\u2019s discharge. (See text box below). The  stakeholders and literature indicated that this education may (1) facilitate  a non-combative relationship between the mother and health care  providers; (2) help to reassure and support the mother, who may feel  responsible for the infant\u2019s suffering, in addition to facilitating treatment of  NAS; and (3) help the mother understand her infant\u2019s behavior and  develop greater confidence in her parenting skills. For example, one  article noted that an infant\u2019s withdrawal behavior, such as fisting, back  arching, and jaw clenching, may be misinterpreted by the mother as  dislike of touch, and that educating mothers on these behaviors can help  alleviate feelings of guilt.", "Education for mothers on prenatal care, treatment for neonatal abstinence  syndrome (NAS), and resources for after an infant\u2019s hospital discharge", "Explaining to the mother during the prenatal period what she can expect when the  infant is born to help ensure she understands the effects of and treatment for NAS;  Informing the mother about non-pharmacologic treatment techniques that can help  reduce the severity of the infant\u2019s NAS symptoms;", "Modeling good parenting skills, such as demonstrating how to comfort an infant  who may be crying inconsolably for hours because of withdrawal; and  Informing the mother about contraception for preventing future pregnancies.", "Educating health care providers on the stigma faced by women who  use opioids during pregnancy, and how to screen for and treat NAS.  Most stakeholders we interviewed and several of the literature articles we  reviewed recommended educating health care providers, including  providers who are not addiction specialists, on both the stigma faced by  women who use opioids during pregnancy as well as on how to screen for  and treat infants with NAS. The stakeholders and literature indicated that  this education may: (1) improve care so that mothers with opioid use  disorders feel more comfortable seeking and obtaining prenatal care, (2)  help health care providers know how to recognize NAS symptoms to help  ensure infants receive appropriate treatment, and (3) allow for more  consistency among these providers in NAS screening and treatment. For  example, 26 stakeholders told us that educating health care providers  about stigma is important because provider attitudes affect how and if  pregnant women obtain prenatal care and treatment for their opioid use  disorders, which can affect the severity of NAS. Additionally, several  articles we reviewed noted the importance of educating and training  clinicians on how to administer the screening tools used to identify infants  with NAS, which helps ensure infants are identified and receive optimal  care.", "Using a protocol for screening and treating infants with NAS. While  there is no single national standard of care for screening and treating  NAS, most stakeholders we interviewed and several of the literature  articles we reviewed recommended that hospital and non-hospital  settings use a protocol to screen for and treat infants with NAS. The  stakeholders and literature indicated that having a protocol can help: (1)  identify infants at risk for NAS, (2) ensure that care is provided  consistently, and (3) reduce the length of stay for infants receiving  pharmacologic treatment. For example, the stakeholders we interviewed  explained that a standard protocol also helps health care providers  understand the tools used to assess the severity of NAS; know the types  of medication used in treatment, including amounts and duration; and  learn how to wean the infant off these medications. Similarly, one article  we reviewed noted that infants who were treated at facilities that adopted  standard treatment protocols experienced shorter durations of  pharmacologic treatment compared with infants who were treated at  facilities that did not use a standard protocol."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges Faced by Health Care Providers in Addressing NAS Include Maternal Use of Multiple Substances and Stigma Faced by Women Who Use Opioids", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholders we interviewed and literature we reviewed identified several  challenges health care providers face in their efforts to address NAS.  The most frequently cited challenges included (1) the use of multiple  substances by pregnant women, which can exacerbate NAS; (2) the  stigma faced by women who use opioids during pregnancy, which may  affect whether they seek prenatal care to address NAS, among other  things; (3) hospital staff burden and limited physical capacity to care for  infants with NAS; (4) limited coordination of care for mothers and infants  with NAS; and (5) gaps in research and data on NAS. These challenges  are described in more detail below.", "The use of multiple substances by pregnant women, which can  exacerbate NAS. Most stakeholders we interviewed and some of the  literature we reviewed noted that the use of multiple substances by  pregnant women, including opioids\u2014referred to as maternal  polysubstance use\u2014can be a challenge, and some stated that the use of  these substances can exacerbate NAS symptoms. According to the  stakeholders, the substances can include methamphetamines, nicotine,  alcohol, cocaine, marijuana, benzodiazepines, and Gabapentin. The  stakeholders and literature indicated that maternal polysubstance use can  lead to multiple conditions in the infant\u2014such as prematurity or Hepatitis  C\u2014that can exacerbate NAS symptoms and prolong the length of an  infant\u2019s hospital stay. For example, one expert noted that many women  with opioid use disorders are also heavy cigarette smokers, and the  nicotine typically exacerbates NAS withdrawal symptoms. Additionally,  officials from a hospital and non-hospital setting we visited told us that  they had developed a separate protocol for treating infants exposed to  multiple substances that includes the use of several medications to  address the more severe NAS withdrawal symptoms.", "Stigma faced by women who use opioids which may affect whether  they seek prenatal care to mitigate the severity of NAS, among other  things. Most stakeholders we interviewed and several of the literature  articles we reviewed noted that the stigma faced by pregnant women with  opioid use disorders is a challenge in addressing NAS. The stakeholders  and literature indicated that stigma may: (1) prevent pregnant women  from seeking substance use treatment or prenatal care; (2) prevent them  from disclosing their drug use to health care providers during pregnancy;  or (3) cause the women to fear punitive effects, such as losing custody of  their children, being detained, or losing their jobs. For example, officials  from one perinatal quality collaborative told us that these women may fail  to seek care because of stigma, which can ultimately make it more  difficult for health care providers to build relationships with these women  and identify infants at risk for NAS.", "Hospital staff burden and limited physical capacity to care for  infants with NAS. According to most stakeholders we interviewed and  some literature we reviewed, staff burden and a limited physical capacity  at facilities can pose challenges for addressing NAS. The stakeholders  and literature indicated that there is increased burden on staff to care for  these infants because they require frequent, personal attention. For  example, the stakeholders explained that a hospital may have to increase  the number of nurses on duty in order to provide the care the infants  need. Health care providers at one hospital said that nurses still struggle  to care for infants with NAS, even with additional staff, because these  infants are overstimulated, cry, and do not eat or sleep well. As a result,  they require much time and one-on-one attention\u2014including cuddling\u2014 from nurses. With respect to physical capacity, some stakeholders told us  that limited physical capacity can make it difficult to (1) find space in the  facility where the infants can be protected from high levels of stimulation  and (2) facilitate the mother-infant bond. For example, some stakeholders  told us that hospitals may not have a dedicated space for rooming-in,  making it more difficult to facilitate bonding between mothers and infants.", "Limited coordination of care for mothers and infants with NAS. Most  stakeholders we interviewed explained that the lack of coordination  among health care providers and others for the mother and infant with  NAS during the prenatal period, after the infant is born, and following the  infant\u2019s discharge can be a challenge. This coordination includes  organizing patient care activities and sharing information among health  care providers, social workers, and all other participants concerned with  the mother and infant\u2019s care. The stakeholders indicated that this lack of  coordination can make it difficult for families to get the resources or  support they need. (See text box below). For example, some  stakeholders told us that women may miss health care visits because of a  lack of access to enabling services such as transportation or child care.", "Limited coordination of care for mothers and infants with neonatal abstinence  syndrome (NAS)   One expert told us that there is a disproportionate number of infants with NAS born in  rural areas. Infants in these areas may be discharged from the hospital without many  follow-up services, such as transportation and care coordination.", "Gaps in research and data on NAS. Some stakeholders we interviewed  noted that gaps in research and data on NAS make it challenging to  conduct research on the affected population and fully understand the  magnitude of the problem. The stakeholders indicated that there are gaps  in adequate research and data on (1) the different types of treatment  approaches for NAS; (2) the extent and effects of maternal polysubstance  use among pregnant women; (3) the long-term effects of prenatal drug  exposure, including the effects seen in childhood and adolescence; and  (4) the efforts to ensure more consistent provider diagnosis and  screening, such as through an improved screening tool. For example, the  stakeholders told us that gaps in research and data may contribute to a  lack of a national standard of care for screening and treating infants with  NAS. According to some stakeholders, this may result in missed  opportunities for identifying and treating infants with NAS. Some  stakeholders also told us that because of gaps in research on the long- term effects of prenatal drug exposure, there is limited information on the  types of services that infants with NAS may need in early childhood.  Additionally, some stakeholders noted they found that because NAS was  not consistently diagnosed and coded in medical records using diagnosis  codes, the condition may be under-reported, and researchers may be  limited in their ability to track these infants."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HHS\u2019s Strategy Includes Recommendations Related to Addressing NAS but Lacks Priorities, Timeframes, and Responsibilities for Implementing the Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["In May 2017, HHS published the Protecting Our Infants Act: Report to  Congress, which\u2014among other things\u2014presents a strategy that identifies  key recommendations related to addressing NAS. Specifically, HHS\u2019s  strategy\u2014known as the Protecting Our Infants Act: Final Strategy\u2014made  39 recommendations related to the prevention, treatment, and related  services for NAS and prenatal opioid use. Of the 39 recommendations  HHS made in its report, we found that 28 of them directly relate to the  recommended practices or challenges that we describe above. For  example, the Strategy recommends the following: promoting non-pharmacologic treatment, such as rooming-in; providing continuing medical education to health care providers for  managing and treating infants with NAS, such as on NAS treatment  protocols;  conducting research on the long-term effects of prenatal drug  exposure so that appropriate services can be developed for infants  with NAS; and establishing clear definitions of NAS and standardizing the use of  diagnosis codes to collect more meaningful and actionable data on  NAS.", "According to the Strategy, the recommendations will be used to inform  planning and policy across HHS.

However, as of September 2017,  HHS could not provide any documentation that it had started to develop  this implementation plan or establish a timeline for completing the plan;  nor was HHS able to provide any information on what the plan may  include. Having such a plan in place is important to ensure priorities are  known and responsibilities are clear so that agencies and stakeholders  can take appropriate action. Federal internal control standards call for  agencies to have defined objectives clearly as part of their objective- setting process and to assign roles and responsibilities for achieving  these objectives. Objectives defined in specific and measurable terms  allow for the assessment of performance toward achieving objectives.  Furthermore, leading principles on sound planning we have identified in  our prior work call for developing robust plans to achieve agency goals.
