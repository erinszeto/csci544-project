In February 2017, GAO found that both contractors had made progress, but their schedules were under mounting pressure. The contractors were originally required to provide NASA all the evidence it needed to certify that their systems met its requirements by 2017.", "A House report accompanying H.R. 5393 included a provision for GAO to review the progress of NASA's human exploration programs. This report examines the Commercial Crew Program, including (1) the extent to which the contractors have made progress towards certification and (2) how NASA's certification process addresses safety of the contractors' crew transportation systems. GAO analyzed contracts, schedules, and other documentation and spoke with officials from NASA, the Commercial Crew Program, Boeing, SpaceX, and two of NASA's independent review bodies that provide oversight."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Both of the Commercial Crew Program's contractors, Boeing and Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX), are making progress finalizing designs and building hardware for their crew transportation systems, but both contractors continue to delay their certification milestone (see figure). Certification is the process that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will use to ensure that each contractor's system meets its requirements for human spaceflight for the Commercial Crew Program.", "Further delays are likely as the Commercial Crew Program's schedule risk analysis shows that the certification milestone is likely to slip. The analysis identifies a range for each contractor, with an earliest and latest possible completion date, as well as an average. The average certification date was December 2019 for Boeing and January 2020 for SpaceX, according to the program's April 2018 analysis. Since the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011, the United States has been relying on Russia to carry astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS). Additional delays could result in a gap in U.S. access to the space station as NASA has contracted for seats on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft only through November 2019. NASA is considering potential options, but it does not have a contingency plan for ensuring uninterrupted U.S. access.", "NASA's certification process addresses the safety of the contractors' crew transportation systems through several mechanisms, but there are factors that complicate the process. One of these factors is the loss of crew metric that was put in place to capture the probability of death or permanent disability to an astronaut. NASA has not identified a consistent approach for how to assess loss of crew. As a result, officials across NASA have multiple ways of assessing the metric that may yield different results. Consequently, the risk tolerance level that NASA is accepting with loss of crew varies based upon which entity is presenting the results of its assessment. Federal internal controls state that management should define risk tolerances so they are clear and measurable. Without a consistent approach for assessing the metric, the agency as a whole may not clearly capture or document its risk tolerance with respect to loss of crew."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making five recommendations, including that NASA develop a contingency plan for ensuring a U.S. presence on the ISS and clarify how it will determine its risk tolerance for loss of crew.

Each contractor is to design, develop, build,  own, and operate its own spaceflight system and infrastructure. The  contractors will have access to NASA\u2019s expertise and resources  throughout the development process, but NASA engineers are not the  ones making design decisions and NASA personnel will be less involved  in processing, testing, launching, and operating the crew transportation  system.

For this  review, we assessed (1) the extent to which the contractors have made  progress towards meeting NASA\u2019s certification requirements and NASA\u2019s  plans to ensure continued access to the ISS; and (2) how NASA\u2019s  certification process addresses safety of the contractors\u2019 crew  transportation systems. To assess the contractors\u2019 progress toward  certification, we reviewed Commercial Crew Program and contract  documents, including quarterly progress updates, monthly risk charts, and  monthly schedule summaries. We also interviewed program and contract  officials to identify steps being taken to mitigate risks and assess the  extent of cost or schedule effects if the risk is realized. For each  contractor, we compared the original contract schedule to the most  current contract schedule and the contractors\u2019 internal development  schedules to determine upcoming events and expected delays. We also  spoke with ISS program officials to determine how NASA plans to  mitigate the effects of these delays on its access to the ISS.", "To assess how NASA\u2019s certification process addresses safety of the  contractors\u2019 crew transportation systems, we reviewed agency safety  policies, program plans, and contract documents to establish when  certification approval would be granted, what safety assessments were  required of the program, and which safety factors would be considered in  certification reviews. For each contractor, we compared agency  requirements to contract requirements for a key safety metric known as  \u201closs of crew,\u201d and interviewed program and agency officials to determine  how loss of crew would be assessed and considered throughout the  certification process. We reviewed program and agency documentation  and interviewed program and agency officials to determine the role of the  safety and mission assurance technical authority in the program. We also  met with two organizations that provide NASA with independent  assessments of the program, the program\u2019s standing review board and  the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, to gain their perspectives on the  contractor\u2019s progress and how NASA addresses safety in its certification  process.

As the program has passed through these  phases, NASA has generally narrowed down the number of participants.  The early phases of the program were under Space Act agreements,  which is what NASA calls the agreements entered into pursuant to its  other transaction authority. These types of agreements are generally not  subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and allow the  government and its contractors greater flexibility in many areas. Under  these Space Act agreements, NASA relied on the commercial companies  to propose specifics related to their crew transportation systems,  including their design, the capabilities they would provide, and the level of  private investment. In these phases, NASA provided technical support  and determined whether the contractors met certain technical milestones.  In most cases, NASA also provided funding.", "For the final two phases of the program, NASA awarded FAR-based  contracts. By using FAR-based contracts, NASA gained the ability to  procure missions to the ISS, while continuing to provide technical  expertise and funding to the contractors. NASA levied two sets of  requirements on the contractors:  the ISS program requirements, which must be met by all spacecraft  visiting the ISS whether they carry cargo or crew; and  the Commercial Crew Program requirements, which have a focus on  system capabilities and safety rather than design.", "The program also established a verification closure notice process, in  which the contractors submit data to NASA to verify they have met all the  requirements to be certified.

We reported that both Boeing and SpaceX had determined  that they would not be able to meet their original 2017 certification  dates, and both expected certification to be delayed until 2018. We  found that the schedule pressures were amplified by NASA\u2019s need to  provide a viable crew transportation option because its contract with  Russia\u2019s space agency was to provide crew transportation to the ISS  for six astronauts through 2018 with rescue and return through late  spring 2019. Purchasing additional seats from Russia involves a  contracting process that typically takes 3 years. Without a viable  contingency option for ensuring uninterrupted access to the ISS in the  event of further Commercial Crew delays, we concluded that NASA  was at risk of not being able to maximize the return on its multibillion  dollar investment in the space station.", "The Commercial Crew Program was using mechanisms laid out in its  contracts to gain a high level of visibility into the contractors\u2019 crew  transportation systems, but maintaining that level of visibility through  certification could add schedule pressures. We noted that, for  example, due to NASA\u2019s acquisition strategy for this program, its  personnel were less involved in the testing, launching, and operation  of the crew transportation system. While the program developed  productive working relationships with both contractors, obtaining the  level of visibility that the program required had also taken more time  than the program or contractors had anticipated. Ultimately, we noted  that the program had the responsibility for ensuring the safety of U.S.  astronauts, and its contracts gave it deference to determine the level  of visibility required to do so. We concluded that the program office  could face difficult choices moving forward about how to maintain the  level of visibility it feels it needs without adding to the program\u2019s  schedule pressures.", "In order to ensure that the United States had continued access to the ISS  if the Commercial Crew Program\u2019s contractors experienced additional  schedule delays, we recommended in our February 2017 report that the  NASA Administrator develop a contingency plan for maintaining a  presence on the ISS beyond 2018, including options to purchase  additional Russian Soyuz seats, and report to Congress on the results.  NASA concurred with this recommendation, and in February 2017, NASA  executed a contract modification that purchased two seats and included  an option to purchase three additional crewmember seats from Boeing on  the Russian Soyuz vehicle.

In some abort scenarios, Boeing has found that the  spacecraft may tumble, which could pose a threat to the crew\u2019s safety.  To validate the effectiveness of its abort system, Boeing has  conducted extensive wind tunnel testing and plans to complete a pad  abort test in July 2018.", "Parachute System: Boeing is also addressing a risk that during  descent, a portion of the spacecraft\u2019s forward heat shield may re- contact the spacecraft after it is jettisoned and damage the parachute  system. Boeing\u2019s analysis indicates the risk exists only if one of two  parachutes that pull the forward heat shield away from the spacecraft  does not deploy as expected, and that potential re-contact is non- detrimental. However, NASA\u2019s independent analysis indicates that  this may occur even if both parachutes deploy as expected. If the  program determines this risk is unacceptable, Boeing would need to  redesign the parachute system, which the program estimates could  result in at least a 6-month delay.", "Launch Vehicle Data: One of the program\u2019s top programmatic and  safety concerns is that it may not have enough information from  Boeing\u2019s launch vehicle provider, United Launch Alliance, to assess  whether the Atlas V launch vehicle prevents or controls cracking that  could lead to catastrophic failures. NASA estimates that unfinished  work in this area could take Boeing and the United Launch Alliance  until the fourth quarter of 2018 to complete. Additionally, the first stage  of the Atlas V is powered by the Russian built RD-180 engine, and,  according to program and Boeing officials, access to its data is highly  restricted by agreements between the U.S. and Russian  governments.

In the May 2018 meeting minutes, however, the  Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel stated that with appropriate controls  in place, this approach could be a viable option for the program to  consider. SpaceX\u2019s perspective is that this operation may be a lower  risk to the crew because it reduces the crew exposure time while the  launch vehicle is being loaded with propellant. To better understand  the propellant loading procedures, the program and SpaceX agreed to  demonstrate the loading process five times from the launch site in the  final crew configuration prior to the crewed flight test. The five events  include the uncrewed flight test and the in-flight abort test.

Further, the  program\u2019s chief safety and mission assurance officer is dual hatted to  serve simultaneously in a programmatic position as well as the program\u2019s  safety technical authority.

For example, if a  control requires that an item be waterproofed, verification and  validation strategies could include inspections and tests to confirm  that the item is waterproof.

The  program has begun phase three, including approving 19 percent of  Boeing\u2019s phase three reports.", "Program Requirements. While the program manager told us that all of  the requirements contribute to the safety of the commercial systems,  safety officials are required to approve a subset of these requirements.  Examples of requirements approved by safety officials include the ability  to leave the spacecraft in an emergency or to abort a launch. When a  contractor is ready for NASA to verify that it has met a requirement, the  contractor submits data for NASA to review through a verification closure  notice. We define \u201csafety-specific notices\u201d as those requiring safety  officials\u2019 approval.

The program also requires testing to verify and validate the crew  transportation system. Agency officials emphasized the importance of  testing to safety, stating that testing reduces uncertainty about a system\u2019s  performance and can uncover unknown problems. As noted above, both  contractors will be conducting an uncrewed and a crewed flight test prior  to being certified. While a certain level of risk needs to be accepted to  conduct human spaceflight, these flight tests help to mitigate this risk by  validating the integrated performance of the hardware and software.

We have  previously found that the program\u2019s workload was an emerging schedule  risk, and the contractors have continued to express concern about  program officials\u2019 ability to process and approve certification paperwork in  a timely manner. Workload has also been a concern for two of NASA\u2019s  independent review organizations. For example, the Aerospace Safety  Advisory Panel noted in its January 2018 annual report that the sheer  volume of work that remains for the program in terms of closing hazard  reports and verification closure notices is significant.

Loss of crew captures the probability of death or  permanent disability to one or more crew members. It has received a lot  of attention, in part, because it has been a top risk for the program since  2015. Specifically, the program has been concerned that neither  contractor would be able to meet the contract requirement of a 1 in 270  probability of incurring loss of crew. We identified two key concerns with  how NASA is using the loss of crew metric: (1) inconsistent approaches to  assess the loss of crew metric and (2) no identified plan to share lessons  learned about using the loss of crew metric as a safety threshold.", "A loss of crew value is generated through a probabilistic safety analysis,  which models scenarios that could result in the loss of crew using various  inputs. According to the program\u2019s analysis, the probability of on-orbit  debris damaging the vehicle has the greatest effect on a loss of crew  value. This probability is informed by an orbital debris (debris) model,  which was updated in 2014, after the loss of crew requirement was  established. The updated debris model makes it harder to meet a loss of  crew value, in part, because the modeling environment where the  contractors\u2019 systems will operate has changed. For example, the updated  model includes a larger span of orbit, greater range of debris sizes, and  the addition of material density classifications, which were not included in  the former model. Further, the probabilistic safety analysis may include  operational mitigations, such as on-orbit inspections that would include  using cameras on the ISS to visually survey the spacecraft for damage,  which, according to officials, makes it easier to meet a loss of crew value.", "NASA describes the probabilistic safety analysis as a powerful tool that  should be used as part of the overall risk management process to ensure  the risk associated with development and operation of a system is  understood, evaluated, managed, and mitigated. However, we found  differences in the approaches that officials plan to use to assess loss of  crew as well as in the loss of crew value being measured that could limit  the usefulness of this tool.", "Agency Certification. The agency certification review for each  contractor will include an assessment of whether its crew  transportation system meets a loss of crew threshold of 1 in 150 for  missions to the ISS, which is based on a May 2011 safety memo from  the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance. A loss of crew value with  a higher denominator, such as 1 in 270, is harder to meet than with a  lower denominator, such as 1 in 150. According to the Chief of the  Office of Safety and Mission Assurance, he will assess the 1 in 150  threshold using a probabilistic safety analysis that includes the  updated debris model and operational mitigations, such as the on- orbit inspections cited above.", "Program Office. According to program officials, they will assess  whether either contractor meets a 1 in 270 loss of crew value based  on a probabilistic safety analysis using the former debris model (not  the updated model) and not including operational mitigations.", "Contracting Officer. According to the contracting officer, each  contractor\u2019s loss of crew requirement is 1 in 270 without including  operational mitigations. The contracting officer stated that SpaceX\u2019s  contract requirement uses the updated debris model in the  probabilistic safety analysis, whereas Boeing\u2019s contract requirement  uses the former debris model in the probabilistic safety analysis.", "Program\u2019s Chief Safety and Mission Assurance Officer. According  to the program\u2019s chief safety and mission assurance officer, he will  conduct a probabilistic safety analysis using the updated debris model  and will not include operational mitigations to assess whether each  contractor meets a 1 in 200 loss of crew value. This loss of crew value  stems from a program update that occurred after the initial contracts  were signed.", "These different approaches are summarized in table 3 below.", "Agency policy requires human spaceflight programs to set a safety  threshold, which NASA did for the Commercial Crew Program when it  identified the 1 in 150 loss of crew threshold in the May 2011 safety  memo. Subsequently, the program set more rigorous loss of crew values  in contract and program documents. NASA also updated the debris  model, which we previously noted makes it more difficult to meet a loss of  crew value. As a result, NASA does not have a consistent approach for  how to incorporate key inputs to the probabilistic safety analysis, including  changes to the debris model. Instead, the risk tolerance that NASA is  accepting with loss of crew varies based upon which entity is presenting  the results of its probabilistic safety analysis. For example, it is possible  that the program\u2019s assessment will determine that neither contractor will  meet the 1 in 270 contract requirement, but that the agency\u2019s assessment  will determine that the contractors meet the 1 in 150 agency certification  value because that analysis will include operational mitigations. Or the  program\u2019s assessment could determine that Boeing meets the 1 in 270  contractual loss of crew requirement, but the agency\u2019s assessment may  determine that Boeing does not meet the 1 in 150 agency certification  value because that analysis will use the updated debris model.", "Federal internal controls state that agency management should define  objectives clearly to enable the identification of risks and define risk  tolerances. Specifically, management should define risk tolerances in  specific and measurable terms, so they are clearly stated and can be  measured. In this case, because there will be multiple analyses  conducted using different inputs, NASA risks not clearly capturing or  documenting, in a coherent manner, its overall risk tolerance with respect  to loss of crew before a final decision must be made on whether to certify  either crew transportation system.", "Moreover, capturing the challenges and lessons learned from using the  loss of crew metric is critical, particularly because agency officials told us  that this is the first time this metric has been used as a safety threshold.  Also, there are different viewpoints about the utility of the metric as a  safety threshold across the agency. The program manager repeatedly  told us that loss of crew is best used as a design tool. For example,  program officials told us that both contractors incorporated additional  orbital debris shielding into their designs to mitigate the orbital debris risk  and improve their loss of crew values. In addition, the Aerospace Safety  Advisory Panel reported in 2018 that loss of crew should not be viewed  as an absolute measure of actual risk during operations. However, the  May 2011 agency safety memo states that a breach of the loss of crew  threshold would initiate a termination review of the Commercial Crew  Program, which is a more strict application of the loss of crew metric.", "Both program and safety officials told us that, after the agency  certification is complete and lessons learned are available to be compiled,  sharing those lessons learned across NASA would be a good idea given  the complexities associated with assessing the loss of crew metric. As of  April 2018, however, agency officials said they did not have a plan for  loss of crew knowledge-sharing. We have previously found that lessons  learned provide a powerful method of sharing good ideas for improving  work processes, facility or equipment design and operation, quality,  safety, and cost-effectiveness. Further, according to NASA\u2019s Knowledge  Policy on Program and Projects, which is managed through the Office of  the Chief Engineer, a principle of each center and mission directorate\u2019s  knowledge strategy is that knowledge is the cornerstone of NASA\u2019s ability  to achieve mission success. The policy acknowledges that NASA faces  continuous challenges in using what it knows effectively. These  challenges include, but are not limited to, enabling the identification and  flow of knowledge across organizational boundaries; preserving  knowledge at risk of being lost; and providing means for individuals,  teams, and the organization to learn from experiences. If NASA does not  capture lessons learned from the Commercial Crew Program on using the  loss of crew requirement to set a program\u2019s safety threshold and whether  it met the agency\u2019s intended goal, future programs will not be able to  benefit from the knowledge gained from this multibillion dollar investment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Commercial Crew Program\u2019s Organizational Structure Impairs Independence of Safety Technical Oversight Supporting the Certification Process", "paragraphs": ["NASA\u2019s governance model prescribes a management structure that  employs checks and balances among key organizations to ensure that  decisions have the benefit of different points of view and are not made in  isolation. As part of this structure, NASA established the technical  authority process as a system of checks and balances to provide  independent oversight of programs and projects in support of safety and  mission success through the selection of specific individuals with  delegated levels of authority. The technical authority process has been  used in other parts of the government for acquisitions, including the  Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security.", "The Commercial Crew Program is organizationally connected to three  technical authorities within NASA: the Office of the Chief Engineer  technical authority, the Office of Chief Health and Medical technical  authority, and the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (safety)  technical authority. The safety technical authority is responsible for  ensuring from an independent standpoint that the program\u2019s products and  processes satisfy NASA\u2019s safety, reliability, and mission assurance  policies. The NASA safety technical authority has delegated authority  through the Kennedy Space Center Director to the Chief Safety and  Mission Assurance Officer for the Commercial Crew Program.", "We have previously reviewed how NASA has organized its technical  authorities for its Exploration Systems Development organization\u2014an  organization that oversees the development of the Space Launch  System, Orion crew capsule, and associated ground systems that have  the goal of extending human presence beyond low-Earth orbit. In October  2017, we found that the Exploration Systems Development organization  had established an organizational structure in which the technical  authorities for engineering and safety and mission assurance were dual  hatted simultaneously in programmatic positions. We found that having  the same individual simultaneously fill both a technical authority role and  a program role created an environment of competing interests, where the  technical authority\u2019s ability to impartially and objectively assess the  programs while at the same time acting on behalf of the Exploration  Systems Development organization in programmatic capacities may be  subject to impairments.", "We found that this was in contrast to a recommendation from the  Columbia Accident Investigation Board report\u2014the result of an in-depth  assessment of the technical and organizational causes of the 2003 Space  Shuttle Columbia accident\u2014for NASA to establish a technical authority to  serve independently of the Space Shuttle program, so that employees  would not feel hampered to bring forward safety concerns or  disagreements with programmatic decisions. The board\u2019s findings that  led to this recommendation included a broken safety culture in which it  was difficult for minority and dissenting opinions to percolate up through  the hierarchy; dual center and programmatic roles vested in one person  that had confused lines of authority, responsibility, and accountability and  made the oversight process susceptible to conflicts of interest; and  oversight personnel in positions within the program, increasing the risk  that these staffs\u2019 perspectives would be hindered by too much familiarity  with the programs they were overseeing. In October 2017, we  recommended that the division no longer dual hat two individuals who  had both programmatic and technical authority responsibilities. As of  April 2018, NASA had taken steps to separate the engineering technical  authority position from the programmatic position, and NASA\u2019s Chief of  Safety and Mission Assurance said he planned to separate the safety  position but had not yet completed that action.", "The Commercial Crew Program employs a similar structure to the  Exploration Systems Development organization in that the safety  technical authority is dual hatted simultaneously in a programmatic  position as the Commercial Crew Program\u2019s Safety and Mission  Assurance Manager.

In his dual-hatted  role, this official will be responsible for endorsing the program\u2019s  certification recommendations in two different capacities: as the technical  authority and as a program authority.", "As a result, this structure relies on the same individual to completely  separate two roles\u2014one to manage the Commercial Crew Program\u2019s  safety issues within programmatic cost and schedule constraints, and the  other to assess the same issues in an independent oversight role. While  the Commercial Crew Program may have an additional level of separation  between the safety technical authority and the program\u2019s involvement in  the design of commercial systems due to its shared assurance model with  the commercial providers, the Commercial Crew Program still maintains a  structure where one individual simultaneously serves in both technical  authority and programmatic roles.

We reviewed annual briefings and reports and met with  representatives from two organizations that provide NASA with  independent assessments of the program, the program\u2019s standing review  board and the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, to gain their  perspectives on the contractor\u2019s progress and how NASA addresses  safety in its certification process. We also met with representatives from  the National Transportation Safety Board and three experts with  background on safety in human spaceflight in order to increase our  contextual understanding of the role of safety in human spaceflight  missions.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2017 to July 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": ["Cristina T.

One way that NASA will assess safety is the loss of crew metric, which captures the probability of a crew member's death or disability. However, NASA doesn't have a consistent approach for calculating this metric, so results can vary based on who within NASA is conducting the analysis.", "We recommended that NASA clarify how it will assess loss of crew."]}
