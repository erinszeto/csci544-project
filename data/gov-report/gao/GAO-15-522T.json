As part of this work, GAO also identifies additional opportunities to achieve cost savings or enhanced revenue collection. GAO's 2015 annual report is its fifth in this series ( GAO-15-404S P).", "This statement discusses (1) new opportunities GAO identifies in its 2015 report; (2) the status of actions taken to address the opportunities GAO identified in its 2011-2014 reports; and (3) existing and new tools available to help executive branch agencies and Congress reduce or better manage fragmentation, overlap, and duplication. To identify what actions exist to address these issues and take advantage of opportunities for cost savings and enhanced revenues, GAO reviewed and updated prior work, including recommendations for executive action and matters for congressional consideration."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO's 2015 annual report identifies 66 new actions that executive branch agencies and Congress could take to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government in 24 areas. GAO identifies 12 new areas in which there is evidence of fragmentation, overlap, or duplication. For example, GAO suggests that Congress repeal the statutorily required US Family Health Plan\u2014a decades-old component of the Department of Defense's (DOD) Military Health System\u2014because it duplicates the efforts of DOD's managed care support contractors by providing the same benefit to military beneficiaries. GAO also identifies 12 areas where opportunities exist either to reduce the cost of government operations or enhance revenue collections. For example, GAO suggests that Congress update the way Medicare has paid certain cancer hospitals since 1983, which could save about $500 million per year.", "The executive branch and Congress have made progress in addressing the approximately 440 actions government-wide that GAO identified in its past annual reports. Overall, as of March 6, 2015, 37 percent of these actions were addressed, 39 percent were partially addressed, and 20 percent were not addressed. Executive branch and congressional efforts to address these actions over the past 4 years have resulted in over $20 billion in financial benefits, with about $80 billion more in financial benefits anticipated in future years from these actions. Although progress has been made, fully addressing all the remaining actions identified in GAO's annual reports could lead to tens of billions of dollars of additional savings.", "Addressing fragmentation, overlap, and duplication within the federal government is challenging due to, among other things, the lack of reliable budget and performance information. If fully and effectively implemented, the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 and the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 could help to improve performance and financial information. In addition, GAO has developed an evaluation and management guide ( GAO-15-49SP ), which is being released concurrently with the 2015 annual report. This guide provides a framework for analysts and decision makers to identify and evaluate instances of fragmentation, overlap and duplication and consider options for addressing or managing such instances."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to discuss our 2015 annual report, which  presents 24 opportunities to reduce fragmentation, overlap, and  duplication and achieve other financial benefits.

As described in table 1, these areas span a wide range of federal  functions or missions.", "We consider programs or activities to be fragmented when more than one  federal agency (or more than one organization within an agency) is  involved in the same broad area of national need, which may result in  inefficiencies in how the government delivers services. We identified  fragmentation in multiple programs we reviewed. For example, in our  2015 annual report, we reported that oversight of consumer product  safety involves at least 20 federal agencies, including the Consumer  Product Safety Commission (CPSC), resulting in fragmented oversight  across agencies. Although agencies reported that the involvement of  multiple agencies with various expertise can help ensure more  comprehensive oversight by addressing a range of safety concerns, they  also noted that fragmentation can result in unclear roles and potential  regulatory gaps. Although a number of agencies have a role, no single  entity has the expertise or authority to address the full scope of product  safety activities. We suggested that Congress consider establishing a  formal comprehensive oversight mechanism for consumer product safety  agencies to address crosscutting issues as well as inefficiencies related  to fragmentation and overlap, such as communication and coordination  challenges and jurisdictional questions between agencies. Mechanisms  could include, for example, formalizing relationships and agreements  among consumer product safety agencies or establishing an interagency  work group. CPSC, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the  Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Department of  Commerce\u2019s National Institute of Standards and Technology agreed with  GAO\u2019s matter for congressional consideration, while the remaining  agencies neither agreed nor disagreed.", "Fragmentation can also be a harbinger for overlap or duplication. Overlap  occurs when multiple agencies or programs have similar goals, engage in  similar activities or strategies to achieve them, or target similar  beneficiaries. We found overlap among federal programs or initiatives in a  variety of areas, including nonemergency medical transportation (NEMT).  Forty-two programs across six different federal departments provide  NEMT to individuals who cannot provide their own transportation due to  age, disability, or income constraints. For example, NEMT programs at  both Medicaid, within the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS), and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) have similar goals (to  help their respective beneficiaries access medical services), serve  potentially similar beneficiaries (those individuals who have disabilities,  are low income, or are elderly), and engage in similar activities (providing  NEMT transportation directly or indirectly).", "We found a number of challenges to coordination for these NEMT  programs. For example, Medicaid and VA largely do not participate in  NEMT coordination activities in the states we visited, in part because both  programs are designed to serve their own populations of eligible  beneficiaries and the agencies are concerned that without proper controls  payments could be made for services to ineligible individuals. However,  because Medicaid and VA are important to NEMT, as they provide  services to potentially over 90 million individuals, greater interagency  cooperation\u2014with appropriate controls and safeguards to prevent  improper payments\u2014could enhance services to transportation- disadvantaged individuals and save money. An interagency coordinating  council was developed to enhance federal, state, and local coordination  activities, and it has taken some actions to address human service- transportation program coordination. However, the council has not  convened since 2008 and has provided only limited leadership. For  example, the council has not issued key guidance documents that could  promote coordination, including an updated strategic plan.", "To improve efficiency, we recommended that the Department of  Transportation (DOT), which chairs the interagency coordinating council,  take steps to enhance coordination among the programs that provide  NEMT. In response, DOT agreed that more work is needed to increase  coordination activities with all HHS agencies, especially the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). DOT also said the Federal Transit  Administration is asking its technical assistance centers to assist in  developing responses to NEMT challenges.", "In other aspects of our work, we found evidence of duplication, which  occurs when two or more agencies or programs are engaged in the same  activities or provide the same services to the same beneficiaries. An  example of duplicative federal efforts is the US Family Health Plan  (USFHP)\u2014a statutorily required component of the Department of  Defense\u2019s (DOD) Military Health System\u2014and TRICARE Prime, which  offers the same benefits to military beneficiaries. The USFHP was  initially incorporated into the Military Health System in 1982 when  Congress enacted legislation transferring ownership of certain U.S. Public  Health Service hospitals to specific health care providers, referred to as  designated providers under the program. During the implementation of  the TRICARE program in the 1990s, Congress required the designated  providers to offer the TRICARE Prime benefit to their enrollees in  accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  1997. Today, the USFHP remains a health care option required by statute  to be available to eligible beneficiaries in certain locations, despite  TRICARE\u2019s national presence through the managed care support  contractors. However, the USFHP has largely remained unchanged, and  its role has not since been reassessed within the Military Health System.", "DOD contracts with managed care support contractors to administer  TRICARE Prime\u2014TRICARE\u2019s managed care option\u2014in three regions in  the United States (North, South, and West). Separately, TRICARE Prime  is offered through the USFHP by designated providers in certain locations  within the same three TRICARE regions that are served by a managed  care support contractor. Thus, the USFHP offers military beneficiaries the  same TRICARE Prime benefit that is offered by the managed care  support contractors across much of the same geographic service areas  and through many of the same providers. As a result, DOD has incurred  added costs by paying the USFHP designated providers to  simultaneously administer the same TRICARE Prime benefit to the same  population of eligible beneficiaries in many of the same locations as the  managed care support contractors. To eliminate this duplication within  DOD\u2019s health system and potentially save millions of dollars, we  suggested that Congress terminate the statutorily required USFHP.", "In addition to areas of fragmentation, overlap, and duplication, our 2015  report identified 46 actions that the executive branch and Congress can  take to reduce the cost of government operations and enhance revenue  collections for the U.S. Treasury in 12 areas. These opportunities for  executive branch or congressional action exist in a wide range of federal  government missions (see table 2).", "Examples of opportunities to reduce costs or enhance revenue collections  from our 2015 annual report include updating the way Medicare pays  certain cancer hospitals, rescinding unobligated funds, and re-examining  the appropriate size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.", "Updating the way Medicare pays certain cancer hospitals: To better  control Medicare spending and generate cost savings of almost $500  million per year, Congress should consider changing Medicare\u2019s cost- based payment methods for certain cancer hospitals. Medicare pays  the majority of hospitals using an approach known as the inpatient  and outpatient prospective payment systems (PPS). Under a PPS,  hospitals are paid a predetermined amount based on the clinical  classification of each service they provide to beneficiaries. Beginning  in 1983, in response to concern that certain cancer hospitals would  experience payment reductions under such a system, Congress  required the establishment of criteria under which 11 cancer hospitals  are exempted from the inpatient PPS and receive payment  adjustments under the outpatient PPS. Since these cancer hospitals  were first designated in the early 1980s, cancer care and Medicare\u2019s  payment system have changed significantly. Advances in techniques  and drugs have increased treatment options and allowed for more  localized delivery of care. Along with these developments, the primary  setting for cancer care has shifted from the inpatient setting to the  outpatient setting. In addition, Medicare\u2019s current payment system  better recognizes the resource intensity of hospital care than the  system put in place in 1983.", "While most hospitals are paid a predetermined amount based on the  clinical classification of each service they provide to beneficiaries,  Medicare generally pays these 11 cancer hospitals based on their  reported costs, providing little incentive for efficiency. We found that if  beneficiaries who received care at the 11 cancer hospitals had  received inpatient and outpatient services at nearby PPS teaching  hospitals, Medicare might have realized substantial savings in 2012.  Specifically, we estimated inpatient savings of about $166 million; we  calculated outpatient savings of about $303 million if forgone payment  adjustments were returned to the Medicare Trust Fund. Until  Medicare pays these cancer hospitals in a way that encourages  greater efficiency, Medicare remains at risk for overspending.", "Rescinding unobligated funds: Congress may wish to consider  permanently rescinding the entire $1.6 billion balance of the U.S.  Enrichment Corporation (USEC) Fund, a revolving fund in the U.S.  Treasury. As part of a 2001 GAO legal opinion, we determined that  the USEC Fund was available for two purposes, both of which have  been fulfilled: (1) environmental clean-up expenses associated with  the disposition of depleted uranium at two specific facilities and (2)  expenses of USEC privatization. Regarding the first authorized  purpose, the construction of intended facilities associated with the  disposition of depleted uranium has been completed. Regarding the  second authorized purpose, USEC privatization was completed in  1998 when ownership of USEC was transferred to private investors.  In an April 2014 report to Congress, the Department of Energy\u2019s  (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration stated that the USEC  Fund was one of two sources of funding that it was exploring to  finance research, development, and demonstration of national nuclear  security-related enrichment technologies. However, this is not one of  the authorized purposes of the USEC Fund. Transparency in budget  materials is important for informing congressional decisions, and  DOE\u2019s efforts to utilize USEC Fund monies instead of general fund  appropriations diminish that transparency.", "The House of Representatives included language to permanently  rescind the USEC Fund in H.R. 4923, Energy and Water  Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which passed  the House on July 10, 2014. However, the rescission was not included  in Public Law 113-235, Consolidated and Further Continuing  Appropriations Act, 2015. As of March 2015, legislation containing a  similar rescission had not been introduced in the 114th Congress.", "Re-examining the appropriate size of the Strategic Petroleum  Reserve: DOE should assess the appropriate size of the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to determine whether excess crude oil  could be sold to fund other national priorities. The United States holds  the SPR so that it can release oil to the market during supply  disruptions to protect the U.S. economy from damage. After decades  of generally falling U.S. crude oil production, technological advances  have contributed to increasing U.S. production. Monthly crude oil  production has increased by almost 68 percent from 2008 through  April 2014, and increases in production in 2012 and 2013 were the  largest annual increases since the beginning of U.S. commercial  crude oil production in 1859, according to the Energy Information  Administration (EIA).", "As of September 2014, the reserve had 106 days of imports, which  DOE estimated was valued at about $45 billion as of December 2014.  In addition, as of September 2014, private industry held reserves of  141 days. As a member of the International Energy Agency, the  United States is required to maintain public and private reserves of at  least 90 days of net imports and to release these reserves and reduce  demand during oil supply disruptions.", "We found in September 2014 that DOE had taken steps to assess  aspects of the SPR but had not recently reexamined its size. Without  such a reexamination, DOE cannot be assured that the SPR is  holding an appropriate amount of crude oil. If, for example, DOE  found that 90 days of imports was an appropriate size for the SPR, it  could sell crude oil worth $6.7 billion and use the proceeds to fund  other national priorities. In addition, by reducing the SPR to 90 days,  DOE may be able to reduce its operating costs by about $25 million   DOE concurred with our recommendation, stating that a  per year.broad, long-range review of the SPR is needed and that it has initiated  a process for conducting a comprehensive re-examination of the  appropriate size of the SPR."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congress and Executive Branch Agencies Continue to Make Progress toward Addressing Our Identified Actions", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the 66 new actions identified for this year\u2019s annual report,  we have continued to monitor the progress that executive branch  agencies or Congress have made in addressing the issues we identified  in our 2011-2014 annual reports."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overall Progress on 2011- 2014 Actions", "paragraphs": ["The executive branch and Congress have made progress in addressing a  number of the approximately 440 actions we previously identified (fig.  1).

Most recently, the Army chose not to introduce a new  family of camouflage uniforms into its inventory, in part because of  this legislation, resulting in a cost avoidance of about $4.2 billion over  5 years.", "Employment and Training: Congress and executive branch agencies  have taken actions to help address the proliferation of certain  employment programs and improve the delivery of benefits.  Specifically, in June 2012, we reported on 45 programs administered  by nine federal agencies that supported employment for people with  disabilities and found these programs were fragmented and often  provided similar services to similar populations. The Workforce  Innovation and Opportunity Act, enacted in July 2014, eliminated  three programs that supported employment for people with  disabilities, including the Veterans\u2019 Workforce Investment Program,  administered by the Department of Labor, and the Migrant and  Seasonal Farmworker Program and Projects with Industry,  administered by the Department of Education.

In contrast, leading commercial firms leverage  buying power by strategically managing 90 percent of their spending\u2014 achieving savings of 10 percent or more of total procurements costs.  While strategic sourcing may not be suitable for all procurement  spending, we reported that a reduction of 1 percent from procurement  spending at these agencies would equate to over $4 billion in savings  annually\u2014an opportunity also noted in the House Budget Resolution for  fiscal year 2016.

These categories cover some of the government\u2019s  largest spending categories, including information technology and  professional services. According to OMB, these categories accounted for  $277 billion in fiscal year 2013 federal procurements.

For example, CMS could save billions  of dollars by improving the accuracy of its payments to Medicare  Advantage programs, such as through methodology adjustments to  account for diagnostic coding differences between Medicare Advantage  and traditional Medicare. In addition, we found that federal spending on  Medicaid demonstrations could be reduced by billions of dollars if HHS  were required to improve the process for reviewing, approving, and  making transparent the basis for spending limits approved for Medicaid  demonstrations. In particular, our work between 2002 and 2014 has  shown that HHS approved several demonstrations without ensuring that  they would be budget neutral to the federal government.", "To address this issue, we suggested that Congress could require the  Secretary of Health and Human Services to improve the Medicaid  demonstration review process, through steps such as improving the  review criteria, better ensuring that valid methods are used to  demonstrate budget neutrality, and documenting and making clear the  basis for the approved limits. We concluded in August 2014 that HHS\u2019s  approval of $778 million dollars of hypothetical costs (i.e., expenditures  the state could have made but did not) in the Arkansas demonstration  spending limit and the department\u2019s waiver of its cost-effectiveness  requirement is further evidence of our long-standing concerns that HHS is  approving demonstrations that may not be budget-neutral. HHS\u2019s  approval of the Arkansas demonstration suggests that the Secretary may  continue to approve section 1115 Medicaid demonstrations that raise  federal costs, inconsistent with the department\u2019s policy of budget  neutrality. We maintain that enhancing the process HHS uses to  demonstrate budget neutrality of its demonstrations could save billions in  federal expenditures.", "In our February 2015 high-risk series update, we reported that while CMS  had taken positive steps to improve Medicare and Medicaid oversight in  recent years, in several areas, CMS had still to address some issues and  recommendations, and improper payment rates have remained   We reported that to achieve and demonstrate  unacceptably high. reductions in the estimated $60 billion dollars in Medicare improper  payments in 2014, CMS should fully exercise its authority related to  strengthening its provider and supplier enrollment provisions and address  our open recommendations related to prepayment and postpayment  claims review activities. Similarly, in the area of Medicaid for which the  federal share of estimated improper payments was $17.5 billion in 2014,  we have made recommendations targeted at (1) improving the  completeness and reliability of key data needed for ensuring effective  oversight, (2) implementing effective program integrity processes for  managed care, (3) ensuring clear reporting of overpayment recoveries,  and (4) refocusing efforts on program integrity approaches that are cost- effective.

For example, in 2014, we  identified three actions that Congress could authorize that could increase  tax revenue collections from delinquent taxpayers by hundreds of millions  of dollars over a 5-year period: limiting issuance of passports to  applicants, levying payments to Medicaid providers, and identifying  security clearance applicants. For example, Congress could consider  requiring the Secretary of State to prevent individuals who owe federal  taxes from receiving passports. We found that in fiscal year 2008,  passports were issued to about 16 million individuals; about 1 percent of  these collectively owed more than $5.8 billion in unpaid federal taxes as  of September 30, 2008.

Examples include the following:", "Social Security Offsets: In our 2011 annual report, we reported that  the Social Security Administration (SSA) needs data from state and  local governments on retirees who receive pensions from employment  not covered under Social Security to better enforce offsets and ensure  benefit fairness. In particular, SSA needs this information to fairly and  accurately apply the Government Pension Offset, which generally  applies to spouse and survivor benefits, and the Windfall Elimination  Provision, which applies to retired worker benefits. The Social  Security\u2019s Government Pension Offset and Windfall Elimination  Provision take noncovered employment into account when calculating  Social Security benefits. While information on receipt of pensions from  noncovered employment is available for federal pension benefits from  the federal Office of Personnel Management, it is not available to SSA  for many state and local pension benefits.", "The President\u2019s Fiscal Year 2016 Budget submission re-proposed  legislation that would require state and local governments to provide  information on their noncovered pension payments to SSA so that the  agency can apply the Government Pension Offset and Windfall  Elimination Provision. The proposal includes funds for administrative  expenses, with a portion available to states to develop a mechanism  to provide this information. Also, we continue to suggest that  Congress consider giving the Internal Revenue Service the authority  to collect the information that SSA needs to administer these offsets.  Providing information on the receipt of state and local noncovered  pension benefits to SSA could help the agency more accurately and  fairly administer the Government Pension Offset and Windfall  Elimination Provision and could result in an estimated $2.4 billion\u2014 $6.5 billion in savings over 10 years if enforced both retrospectively  and prospectively. If Social Security enforced the offsets only  prospectively, the overall savings still would be significant.", "Disability and Unemployment Benefits: In our 2014 annual report, we  found that 117,000 individuals received concurrent cash benefit  payments in fiscal year 2010 from the Disability Insurance and  Unemployment Insurance programs totaling more than $850 million  because current law does not preclude the receipt of overlapping  benefits. Individuals may be eligible for benefit payments from both  Disability Insurance and Unemployment Insurance due to differences  in the eligibility requirements; however, in such cases, the federal  government is replacing a portion of lost earnings not once, but twice.  The President\u2019s Fiscal Year 2016 Budget submission proposes to  eliminate these overlapping benefits, and during the 113th Congress,  bills had been introduced in both the U.S. House of Representatives  and the Senate containing language to reduce Disability Insurance  payments to individuals for the months they collect Unemployment  Insurance benefits. According to CBO, this action could save $1.2  billion over 10 years in the Social Security Disability Insurance  program. Congress should consider passing legislation to offset  Disability Insurance benefit payments for any Unemployment  Insurance benefit payments received in the same period.", "Table 4 highlights some of our suggested actions within these and other  areas that could result in tens of billions of dollars in cost-savings or  revenue-enhancement opportunities, according to estimates from GAO,  executive branch agencies, the Congressional Budget Office, or the Joint  Committee on Taxation."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Existing and New Tools Can Assist in Identifying, Evaluating, and Addressing Fragmentation, Overlap, or Duplication", "paragraphs": ["For GAO\u2019s most recent work on GPRAMA, see GAO, Government Efficiency and  Effectiveness: Inconsistent Definitions and Information Limit the Usefulness of Federal  Program Inventories, GAO-15-83 (Washington D.C.: Oct. 31, 2014); Managing for  Results: Selected Agencies Need to Take Additional Efforts to Improve Customer Service,  GAO-15-84 (Washington D.C.: Oct. 24, 2014); and Managing for Results: Agencies\u2019  Trends in the Use of Performance Information to Make Decisions, GAO-14-747  (Washington D.C.: Sept. 26, 2014).

Some of these options are executive branch reorganization, special  temporary commissions, interagency groups, automatic sunset  provisions, and portfolio or performance-based budgeting. These options  can be used independently or together to assist policymakers in  evaluating and addressing fragmentation, overlap, and duplication  beyond the programmatic level.", "Congress can also use its power of the purse and oversight powers to  incentivize executive branch agencies to act on our suggested actions  and monitor their progress. In particular, the Senate Budget Resolution  for fiscal year 2016 directs committees to review programs and tax  expenditures within their jurisdiction for waste, fraud, abuse, or  duplication and to consider the findings from our past annual reports.  Also, the accompanying report for the House Budget Resolution for fiscal  year 2016 proposes that the Department of Justice (DOJ) streamline  grants into three categories\u2014first responder, law enforcement, and  victims\u2014which is consistent with our prior work recommending that DOJ  better target its grant resources. The resolution also highlights a number  of the issues presented in our annual reports (including the multiple  programs that support Science, Technology, Engineering, and  Mathematics education, housing assistance, homeland security  preparedness grants, and green building initiatives); notes the number of  programs that will need to be reauthorized in fiscal year 2016; and states  that our findings should result in programmatic changes in both  authorizing statutes and program funding levels. Congressional use of our  findings in its decision making for the identified areas of fragmentation,  overlap, and duplication will send an unmistakable message to agencies  that Congress considers these issues a priority.
