GSA provides guidance to improve space utilization. However, GAO found that GSA last developed relevant formal guidance in 2006. This information, and that on GSA's telework and space-planning websites, was neither specific nor detailed and therefore of limited assistance to agencies that would like to use telework as a space-planning tool. Additionally, GSA's space-planning tool\u2014the Workplace Investment and Feasibility Tool, intended to help agencies quantify the benefits and costs of telework\u2013\u2013remains under development after more than 4 years, and GSA officials have not decided whether to make the tool available to other federal agencies.

Nine of the 23 agencies we surveyed  reported challenges associated with managing change. For  example, three agencies reported employees\u2019 discomfort or  apprehension about desk-sharing and hoteling. In 2013, we reported  that organizations may also encounter concerns from agency leaders,  managers, employees, or employee organizations when introducing  physical space changes associated with increased workforce mobility  (telework).

One noted  that management needed to make the business case to employees so  that each layer of the organization could understand the importance of  the initiative and its potential benefits. Another suggested a change  management plan tailored to the work performed within a unit. This  individual said that key components of such a plan might include  studying existing work practices and program requirements, surveying  employee preferences, and including employees in the planning  process.

For  example, the Veterans Administration reported that although it developed  an agency-wide telework policy, each sub-agency and supervisor has the  flexibility to implement telework based on operational needs. Moreover,  because the agency\u2019s core mission involves direct services to veterans,  about 83 percent of agency staff positions are not suitable for telework.  The Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 outlines two broad exceptions to  telework participation for employees: (1) directly handling secure  materials determined to be inappropriate for telework by the agency head  and (2) on-site activity that cannot be handled remotely or at an  alternative worksite.

For example, the National Strategy outlines a  framework that aims to measure real property costs and utilization to  improve the efficient use of federal real property. The Reduce the  Footprint policy requires agencies to measure cost savings that result  from reducing space through disposals. However, neither document  offers guidance or methodologies on how to measure the costs or savings  that may result from using telework. We previously reported that GSA  works with client agencies to develop tools to measure office space  utilization and, in 2013, was developing an Excel-based tool to help  agencies quantify the benefits and costs of using telework to achieve  greater office space efficiencies. This tool\u2014the Workplace Investment  and Feasibility Tool\u2014is aimed at helping agencies quantify the benefits  and costs of increased telework participation and implementing other  alternative-work arrangements. When completed, the tool will enable  users to quickly develop rough estimates of cost and space impacts  resulting from workplace changes, particularly relating to desk-sharing,  workspace reconfiguration, and consolidation. Key features include the  ability to compare up to three scenarios, which in turn may be used to  inform a more detailed design program.", "As of January 2018, GSA had not yet completed the tool. GSA officials  said mission needs, resource constraints, and developmental  adjustments have contributed to delays in the time frame for completing  the tool. They added that during this time, GSA has diverted resources to  space calculation tools for individual agencies. For example, GSA worked  with DHS on its Space Calculation Tool as a way to help determine  workplace space requirements in a manner consistent with DHS space  policies. In January 2018, GSA officials told us that they plan to make the  Workplace Investment and Feasibility Tool available to GSA staff in  March 2018 along with training on how to use it. However, GSA officials  have not decided whether to make the tool available to other federal  agencies to use as a space-planning tool. Instead, the officials plan to  assess GSA\u2019s use of the tool and then determine in late 2018 if and how  it should be released to other agencies for independent use. Given the  absence of a government-wide tool, in our review, we found that some  agencies had used their own resources to purchase similar tools for their  space-planning needs from the private sector.

Moreover, under federal statute, GSA  may provide guidance to executive agencies on the implementation of  alternative workplace arrangements, which includes telework. Federal  standards for internal control also call for agencies to communicate  necessary quality information such as guidance with external parties.", "In reviewing GSA\u2019s websites, we found that GSA last developed formal  guidance on alternative workplace arrangements in 2006 and maintains  several separate informational websites on implementing telework and  optimizing space utilization. Our review of this guidance and these  websites found that they do not provide specific guidance for using  telework as a strategic space-planning tool. For example, the 2006  guidance is generally limited to defining the factors agency heads must  contemplate when considering alternative workplace arrangements along  with the equipment and technical services agencies may provide for  alternative worksites. However, this guidance does not address in detail  the impact of such arrangements on agency office space and resulting  planning issues. Similarly, our review of GSA\u2019s teleworking and space- planning websites found that although they separately offered  documented case studies along with information such as tips for  implementing telework and managing a mobile workforce, GSA did not  provide documents consolidating the concept of using telework as a  strategic space-planning tool. For example, information on GSA\u2019s Total  Workplace Program website\u2013\u2013intended to assist agencies in using  workforce mobility (including telework) to increase space efficiencies\u2013\u2013is  generally limited. Although this website includes high-level information  that describes the potential benefits of using telework with office space  planning and design, it lacks a practical outline of the process agencies  might use to achieve them.

We also conducted a content analysis on the open-ended,  narrative-based questions by identifying common themes and tabulating  results. We also conducted a content analysis to determine the extent to  which agencies referenced telework in their agency-wide space-planning  documents and in their Real Property Efficiency Plans. To accomplish  these analyses, we developed separate coding schemes for each of the  two types of documents.
