GAO also previously reviewed federal financial assurance requirements for various energy and mineral extraction sectors and found that coal mining is the only one where self-bonding was allowed.

To help ensure that reclamation  occurs, SMCRA requires an operator to submit a financial assurance  (e.g., a bond) in an amount sufficient to ensure that adequate funds will  be available for the regulatory authority\u2014either the Department of the  Interior\u2019s Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement  (OSMRE) or an approved state regulatory authority\u2014to complete  required reclamation if the operator does not do so. If specific conditions  are met, SMCRA allows states to let an operator guarantee the cost for  reclaiming a mine on the basis of its own finances, a practice known as  self-bonding, rather than by securing a bond through another company or  providing collateral, such as cash, letters of credit, or real property.", "Three of the largest coal mining companies in the United States filed for  bankruptcy in 2015 and 2016. This drew attention to whether financial  assurances obtained by OSMRE and approved state regulatory  authorities will be adequate to reclaim land once coal mining operations  have ceased, particularly in cases where operators had used self-bonds  as their financial assurance. In August 2016, citing the recent  bankruptcies, lower market demand for coal, and the potential for more  market downturn, OSMRE issued a policy advisory to states suggesting,  among other things, that states take steps to assess whether operators  currently using self-bonds continue to qualify to do so and that states not  accept new self-bonds. Moreover, in September 2016, in response to a  petition seeking revisions to its self-bonding regulations, OSMRE stated  that it planned to examine changes to its bonding regulations that would,  among other things, help ensure the completion of the reclamation plan if  the regulatory authority has to perform the work in the event the operator  does not do so.", "You asked us to review OSMRE\u2019s oversight of financial assurances for  coal mine reclamation.

We also reviewed agency documents, including the 2010 National Priority  Review that examined how financial assurance amounts were calculated,  and interviewed OSMRE officials from its headquarters and its three  regional offices. We selected a nonprobability sample of 7 states\u2014 Illinois, Kentucky, Montana, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, West Virginia, and  Wyoming\u2014to examine OSMRE\u2019s oversight activities in more detail. We  generally selected states that produced the most coal in 2015 (the most  recent data at the time we began our review), according to the U.S.  Energy Information Administration. We also selected states to achieve  some variation in factors such as geographic location, the dominant type  of coal mining conducted (e.g., surface or underground mining), whether  the state had primacy, and whether the state allowed self-bonding (see  app. I). Because this is a nonprobability sample, the oversight activities in  the 7 states are not generalizable to all 25 primacy and nonprimacy states  with active coal mining but provide illustrative examples. For each of the  7 states, we reviewed agency documents, including OSMRE\u2019s annual  evaluation of the state\u2019s program, agreements between OSMRE and the  state regulatory authority specifying oversight steps OSMRE would take,  and in some cases OSMRE and state documents related to OSMRE\u2019s  determination that a state was not implementing its primacy program as  required.

As of  2016, state regulatory authorities and OSMRE had received financial  assurances associated with coal mines that had been permitted to disturb  approximately 2.3 million acres, according to OSMRE data.", "Coal is mined in two different ways: surface mining and underground  mining. In surface coal mining, before the underlying coal can be  extracted, the land is cleared of forests and other vegetation and topsoil is  removed and stored for later use. Explosives or other techniques are then  used to break up the overlying solid rock, creating dislodged earth, rock,  and other materials known as spoil. Surface coal mines can cover an  area of many square miles. In underground coal mining, tunnels are dug  to access coal that is too deep for surface mining methods. In some  cases, underground coal mines are designed to leave sufficient coal in  the mine to support the overlying surface, and in other cases, they are  designed to extract higher quantities of coal that results in subsidence of  the overlying surface as mining progresses.", "In addition to disturbing the land surface, coal mining can affect water  quality, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, the National  Academies, and others. For example, mining can increase sediments in  rivers or streams, which may negatively affect aquatic species. Moreover,  mining can expose minerals and heavy metals to air and water, leading to  a condition known as acid mine drainage, which can lead to long-term  water pollution and harm some fish and wildlife species. Mining can also  lower the water table or change surface drainage patterns."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Regulation of Coal Mining", "paragraphs": ["The surface effects of coal mining in the United States are regulated  under SMCRA, which also created OSMRE to administer the act.

A state with an approved program is  said to have \u201cprimacy\u201d for that program. To obtain primacy, a state or  Indian tribe submits to the Secretary of the Interior for approval a program  that demonstrates that the state or tribe has the capability of carrying out  the requirements of SMCRA. The program must demonstrate that the  state or Indian tribe has, among other things, a law that provides for the  regulation of the surface effects of coal mining and reclamation in  accordance with the requirements of SMCRA, and a regulatory authority  with sufficient personnel and funding to do so. Of the 25 states and four  Indian tribes that OSMRE identified as having active coal mining in 2017,  23 states had primacy, and OSMRE manages the coal program in  2 states and for the four Indian tribes.", "SMCRA requires a mine operator to obtain a permit before starting to  mine. The permit process requires operators to submit plans describing  the extent of proposed mining operations and how and on what timeline  the mine sites will be reclaimed. In general, an operator must reclaim the  land to a use it was capable of supporting before mining or to an  alternative postmining land use that OSMRE or the state regulatory  authority deems higher or better than the premining land use. In  reclaiming the mine site, operators must comply with regulatory standards  that govern, among other things, how the reclaimed area is regraded,  replanting of the site, and the quality of water flowing from the site.  Specifically:", "Operators are generally required to return mine sites to their  approximate original contour unless the operator receives a variance  from the regulatory authority. To return to this contour, the surface  configuration achieved by backfilling and grading of the mined area  must closely resemble the general surface configuration of the land  before mining and blend into and complement the drainage pattern of  the surrounding terrain, with all highwalls and spoil piles eliminated.", "Operators are required to demonstrate successful revegetation of the  mine site for 5 years (in locations that receive more than 26 inches of  rain annually) or 10 years (in drier areas). States have requirements  for what vegetation may be planted depending on the approved  postmining land use. For example, West Virginia\u2019s regulations call for  sites with a postmining land use of forest land to be planted with at  least 500 woody plants per acre. The state specifies that at least five  species of trees be used, including at least three of the species being  higher value hardwoods, such as oak, ash, or maple.", "SMCRA requires that financial assurances be sufficient to ensure  reclamation compliant with water quality standards, including those  established by the Environmental Protection Agency or the states  under the Clean Water Act.

Specifically, Congress found that a substantial number of acres of land throughout the  United States had been disturbed by surface and underground coal  mining on which little or no reclamation was conducted. Further, it found  that the impacts from these unreclaimed lands imposed social and  economic costs on residents in nearby areas as well as impaired  environmental quality. Since the abandoned mine land program was  created, approximately $3.9 billion has been spent to reclaim abandoned  mine lands, and there is at least $10.2 billion in remaining reclamation  costs for coal mines abandoned prior to 1977, as of September 30, 2017,  according to OSMRE."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Assurances for Reclamation", "paragraphs": ["SMCRA generally requires operators to submit a financial assurance in  an amount sufficient to ensure that adequate funds will be available for  OSMRE or the state regulatory authority to complete the reclamation if  the operator does not do so.

One kind of alternative bonding system is known as a bond pool. Under  this type of system, the operator may post a financial assurance for an  amount determined by multiplying the number of acres in the permit area  by a per-acre assessment. The per-acre assessment may vary depending  on the site-specific characteristics of the planned mining operation and  the operator\u2019s history of compliance with state regulations. However, the  per-acre bond amount may be less than the estimated cost of  reclamation.

State and OSMRE officials said that it  can take many years to fully reclaim a site and that it may take time for  them to identify the extent of reclamation needed and to determine if the  amount of financial assurance forfeited was sufficient to cover  reclamation costs.", "State and OSMRE officials said there were several reasons why the  amount of financial assurance obtained might not be sufficient to cover  reclamation costs. For example, officials said the amount of financial  assurance might not be sufficient if an operator mined in a manner  inconsistent with the approved mining plan upon which the amount of  financial assurance was calculated or if mining activity resulted in water  pollution that was not considered when the amount of financial assurance  was calculated. In cases where the amount of financial assurance does  not cover the cost of reclamation, the operator remains responsible for reclaiming the mine site. However, OSMRE officials said that in those  cases where the operator may be experiencing financial difficulties, it  might be difficult for the states or OSMRE to compel the operator to  complete the reclamation or provide additional funds to do so without  having the operator go out of business or into bankruptcy. If the operator  does not reclaim the site, the regulatory authority must use the forfeited  financial assurance to do so. If the forfeited funds are not adequate, the  site may not be fully reclaimed unless the regulatory authority either  successfully sues the operator for more funds or provides any additional  funds needed for reclamation. One other source of funds states can use  to reclaim forfeited mines is civil penalties that the United States  government collects from operators that violate conditions of their mining  permits.

For example, the financial information that operators  provide reflects their past financial health, which may not reflect the  operators\u2019 current financial position, according to OSMRE\u2019s response  to the 2016 petition seeking revisions to its self-bonding regulations.  In addition, if an operator applying for a self-bond is a subsidiary of  another company, the operator is not required by regulation to submit  information on the financial health of its parent company. While the  operator applying may have sufficient financial assets to qualify for  self-bonding, if its parent company experiences financial difficulties,  the operator\u2019s assets may be drawn on to meet the parent\u2019s  obligations, which could worsen the financial health of the self-bonded  operator. In addition, according to OSMRE officials, even if OSMRE or  a state regulatory authority were to become aware that an operator\u2019s  parent company was at financial risk, it would be difficult for the  agency to deny the operator\u2019s request for a self-bond because  eligibility is specific to the entity applying for the self-bond, according  to regulations.", "OSMRE could change its self-bonding regulations to require more  information, according to OSMRE officials. However, the financial  relationships between parent and subsidiary companies have become  increasingly complex, making it difficult to ascertain an operator\u2019s  financial health on the basis of information reported in company  financial and accounting documents, according to officials. When  OSMRE first approved its self-bonding regulations in 1983, it noted  that it was attempting to provide rules that would allow self-bonding  without necessitating regulatory authorities to employ financial experts  to determine which companies should be allowed to self-bond.  However, according to OSMRE officials, financial expertise is now  often needed to evaluate the current complex financial structures of  large coal companies, which was not envisioned when the regulations  were developed.", "Difficulty in determining whether an operator qualifies for self- bonding. The regulatory authority in a given state may not be aware  that an operator had self-bonded in other states, making it difficult for  the agency to determine whether the operator qualifies for self- bonding, according to some parties we interviewed. Operators are  only allowed to self-bond for up to 25 percent of their net worth in the  United States, according to regulations. Regulatory authority  decisions on accepting self-bonds generally focus on assessing  activities occurring in a specific state, not nationwide, according to the  Interstate Mining Compact Commission. As a result, the state  regulatory authority or OSMRE may know whether an operator has  applied for self-bonds in other states that if approved would exceed  25 percent of its net worth in total.", "Difficulty in replacing existing self-bonds with other assurances  if needed. OSMRE and state regulatory authorities may find it difficult  to get operators to replace existing self-bonds with another type of  financial assurance when needed, according to some parties we  interviewed. If an operator no longer qualifies for self-bonding (e.g., if  it has declared bankruptcy), federal regulations require it to either  replace self-bonds with other types of financial assurances or stop  mining and reclaim the site. In either case, however, some parties  noted that such actions could lead to a worsening of the operator\u2019s  financial condition, which could make it less likely that the operator will  successfully reclaim the site.", "Some parties we interviewed have noted that regulatory authorities  may be reluctant to direct the operator to replace a self-bond with  another type of financial assurance and may instead allow the  operator to keep mining so that any generated revenue could help the  operator reclaim the site. For example, in 2015 the Wyoming  regulatory authority determined that an operator no longer qualified for  self-bonding and ordered it to replace a $411 million self-bond.  However, the operator entered into bankruptcy without having  replaced the self-bond. In this case, the state regulatory authority  determined that reclamation was more likely to occur if the operator  continued mining and allowed the operator to do so without a valid  financial assurance. The operator replaced its self-bond as a part of  its bankruptcy settlement approximately 17 months after the state  regulatory authority\u2019s order to replace the self-bond, according to  OSMRE officials. However, if a self-bonded operator were to enter  bankruptcy and did not secure a financial assurance to replace the  self-bond or complete the required reclamation, the state regulatory  authority would have to work through the bankruptcy proceedings to  obtain funds for reclamation, according to OSMRE\u2019s preamble to its  1983 self-bonding regulations. As a result, the state may recover  only some, or possibly none, of the funds promised through the self- bond, and the cost of reclamation could fall on taxpayers.", "Difficulty in managing the risk associated with self-bonding. The  risk associated with self-bonding is greater now than when the  practice was first authorized under SMCRA, according to some  parties we interviewed. According to SMCRA, the purpose of financial  assurances is to ensure that regulatory authorities have sufficient  funds to complete required reclamation if the operator does not do so.  While SMCRA allows self-bonding in certain circumstances, when  OSMRE first approved its self-bonding regulations, the agency did so  noting that at the time there were companies financially sound enough  that the probability of bankruptcy was small. Furthermore, the  regulations stated that the intent was to avoid, to the extent  reasonably possible, the acceptance of a self-bond from a company  that would enter bankruptcy. However, as previously mentioned,  three of the largest coal companies in the United States declared  bankruptcy in 2015 and 2016, and these companies held  approximately $2 billion in self-bonds at the time, according to an  OSMRE August 2016 policy advisory, making it a very different risk  landscape than originally envisioned.", "Following these bankruptcies\u2014and recognizing that the coal industry was  likely to continue to face economic challenges for several more years\u2014 OSMRE initiated steps in 2016 to reexamine the role of self-bonding for  coal mine reclamation. Specifically, as previously mentioned, OSMRE  issued a policy advisory in August 2016 noting that given these  circumstances, state regulatory authorities should exercise their  discretion under SMCRA and not accept new or additional self-bonds for  any permit until coal production and consumption market conditions reach  equilibrium. OSMRE has reported that it is not likely for that to occur until  at least 2021. OSMRE also announced in September 2016 that the  agency planned to examine changes to its bonding regulations that  would, among other things, help ensure that reclamation is completed if a  self-bonded operator does not do so. However, following a review of  department actions that could affect domestic energy production, Interior  announced in October 2017 that it was reconsidering the need for and  scope of potential changes to its bonding regulations. OSMRE officials  said that they did not have a timeline for finalizing a decision on potential  changes in its bonding regulations. In addition, OSMRE rescinded its  August 2016 policy advisory that states take steps to assess whether  operators currently using self-bonds can still quality to do so and that  states not accept any new self-bonds.", "Similar issues involving bankruptcies of hardrock mining operators led the  Bureau of Land Management to implement regulations in 2001  eliminating the use of self-bonding for hardrock mining. In doing so, the  Bureau of Land Management determined that a self-bond is less secure  than other types of financial assurances, especially in cases where  commodity prices fluctuate. The agency also noted that operators that  would otherwise be eligible to self-bond should not have a significant  problem obtaining another type of financial assurance. In our previous  work examining other types of environmental cleanup, we found that the  financial risk to the government and the amount of oversight needed for  self-bonds are relatively high compared to other forms of financial  assurances. Furthermore, we also previously reviewed federal financial  assurance requirements for coal mining, hardrock mining, onshore oil and  gas extraction, and wind and solar energy production and found that of  these activities coal mining is the only one where self-bonding was  allowed. Because SMCRA explicitly allows states to decide whether to  accept self-bonds, eliminating the risk that self-bonding poses to the  federal government and states would require that SMCRA be amended."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Obtaining Additional Financial Assurances for Unanticipated Reclamation Can Be Difficult", "paragraphs": ["Unanticipated reclamation costs, such as those related to long-term  treatment for water pollution, may arise late in a mine\u2019s projected lifespan,  and the operator may not have the financial means to cover the additional  costs, according to OSMRE officials. Under SMCRA, OSMRE and state  regulatory authorities are not to approve a permit for a coal mine if the  regulatory authority expects the mine to result in long-term water  pollution. As a result, since long-term water pollution is not anticipated to  occur, the cost of addressing it would not be included in the initial  financial assurance that the operator provides. If the regulatory authority  later determines that long-term water treatment is needed, the regulatory  authority must adjust the amount of financial assurance that the operator  is required to provide.", "Some parties we interviewed have also noted that the costs and duration  of long-term water treatment are not well defined and that surety bonds  are not well-suited to provide assurance for such indefinite long-term  costs. For example, according to the Interstate Mining Compact  Commission, surety bonds are designed for shorter-term, defined  obligations that have a high certainty for bond release following the  completion of reclamation. To help address this challenge, some states  have established, or allowed operators to establish, trust funds to help  cover such unanticipated reclamation costs. For example, West Virginia  established a fund, primarily supported through a tax on the amount of  coal mined, to operate water treatment systems on forfeited sites. West  Virginia\u2019s regulatory authority is also working to evaluate permits for sites  with water pollution to estimate water treatment costs within the state  more precisely. Similarly, Pennsylvania allows operators to establish trust  funds that are maintained by foundations and monitored by the state  regulatory authority and are intended to ensure that there are sufficient  funds to cover the costs of long-term water treatment, according to state  regulatory authority officials. In addition, the OSMRE-run coal program in  Tennessee allows trust funds for water treatment, in part because an  assurance system that provides an income stream may be better suited  to ensuring the treatment of long-term water pollution than conventional  financial assurances, according to an OSMRE notice in the Federal  Register."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Determining the Financial Stability of Surety Companies Has Been Challenging in Certain Instances", "paragraphs": ["The utility of surety bonds in providing a financial assurance depends on  the surety company\u2019s ability to pay the amount pledged if the operator  forfeits.

Some parties we  interviewed noted that surety companies have declared bankruptcy or  experienced financial difficulties in the past and could experience similar  difficulties in the future. In addition, two states reported recent issues  related to surety companies. For example, state regulatory authority  officials in Alabama said that a surety company that had provided surety  bonds totaling $760,000 for four mines in that state had gone bankrupt or  was insolvent. As of May 2017, the state had collected only $127,000.  Similarly, state regulatory authority officials in Alaska said that as of  August 2017, the state had not collected any part of a forfeited $150,000  surety bond because the surety company had gone bankrupt.

If a self-bonded  operator were to enter bankruptcy and does not provide a different type of  financial assurance or complete the required reclamation, the regulatory  authority and the taxpayer potentially assume the risk of paying for the  reclamation. Although OSMRE said it would examine changes to its self- bonding regulations following recent bankruptcies, Interior recently said  that it is reconsidering the need to do so. Because SMCRA explicitly  allows states to decide whether to accept self-bonds, eliminating the risk  that self-bonding poses would require amending SMCRA.
