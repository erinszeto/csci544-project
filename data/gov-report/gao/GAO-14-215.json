Permanent career employees accounted for most of the growth, increasing by 256,718 employees, from 1.7 million in 2004 to 1.96 million in 2012 (15 percent). Three agencies--the Departments of Defense (DOD), Homeland Security (DHS), and Veterans Affairs (VA)--accounted for about 94 percent of this increase. At DOD, officials said that converting certain positions from military to civilian, as well as the growth of the agency's acquisition and cybersecurity workforce, contributed to this overall increase. At VA, officials said the increased demand for medical and health-related services for military veterans drove most of the growth in personnel levels. DHS officials said the increase in employment was due in large part to the nation's border security requirements. (In contrast, ten agencies had fewer career permanent employees in 2012 than they did in 2004). Government-wide, most of the increase in employment from 2004 to 2012 occurred within occupational categories that require higher skill and educational levels. These categories include professional occupations (e.g., doctors and scientists), and administrative occupations (e.g., financial and program managers), as opposed to clerical, technical, and blue collar occupations (which remained stable). In terms of turnover, retirement rates remained relatively flat (at around 3.5 percent) from 2004 until the start of the recession in December 2007. Retirement rates fell to a low of around 2.5 percent during the recession in 2009, and then increased to pre-recession rates in 2011 and 2012. With respect to retirement eligibility, of the 1.96 million permanent career employees on board as of September 2012, nearly 270,000 (14 percent) were eligible to retire. By September 2017, nearly 600,000 (around 31 percent) will be eligible to retire, government-wide.", "Spending on total government-wide compensation for each full-time equivalent (FTE) position grew by an average of 1.2 percent per year, from $106,097 in 2004 to $116,828 in 2012. Much of this growth was driven by increased personnel benefits costs, which rose at a rate of 1.9 percent per year. Other factors included locality pay adjustments, as well as a change in the composition of the federal workforce (with a larger share of employees working in professional or administrative positions, requiring advanced skills and degrees). In terms of employee pay per FTE, spending rose at an average annual rate of 1 percent per year (a 7.9 percent increase overall). However, as a proportion of governmentwide federal discretionary spending, spending on compensation remained constant from 2004 to 2010 (at 14 percent), with slight increases in 2011 and 2012.", "While the federal civilian workforce grew in size from 2004 to 2012, most of the growth was concentrated in three federal agencies and was driven by the need to address some of the nation's pressing priorities. At the same time--as GAO reported in February 2013--large numbers of retirement-eligible employees in the years ahead may be cause for concern: Their retirement could produce mission critical skills gaps if left unaddressed. As GAO reported in its February 2013 High Risk update, strategic human capital planning that is integrated with broader organizational strategic planning will be essential for ensuring that-- going forward--agenices have the talent, skill, and experience mix they need to cost-effectively execute their mission and program goals."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Current budget and long-term fiscal pressures demand that agencies  operate more strategically and efficiently than ever before, and this  includes cost-effective management of their human capital policies and  practices.

Today\u2019s federal jobs require more advanced skills at higher  grade levels than federal jobs in years past. As a result, a key  management challenge facing the federal government in an era of fiscal  austerity is balancing the size and composition of the federal workforce so  it is able to deliver the high quality services that taxpayers demand, within  the budgetary realities of what the nation can afford.", "As we have previously stated, inadequate planning prior to personnel  reductions jeopardizes the ability of agencies to carry out their missions. For example, in the wake of extensive federal downsizing in the 1990s\u2014 done largely without adequate planning or sufficient consideration of the  strategic consequences\u2014agencies faced challenges deploying the right  skills when and where they were needed.", "More recently, this management challenge has been exacerbated by the  fact that today\u2019s federal workforce consists of a large number of  employees who are eligible for retirement. Various factors affect when  individuals actually retire. Some amount of retirement and other forms of  attrition can be beneficial because it creates opportunities to bring fresh  skills on board and allows organizations to restructure themselves in  order to better meet program goals and fiscal realities. But if turnover is  not strategically managed and monitored, gaps can develop in an  organization\u2019s institutional knowledge and leadership as experienced  employees leave. We have previously reported that the needs and  missions of individual agencies should determine their approach to  workforce planning.", "GAO-09-632T.", "Our prior work has shown that strategic human capital management has  been a pervasive challenge facing the federal government, and has led to  government-wide and agency-specific skills gaps. Our February 2011  update to our high risk list noted that federal strategic human capital  management was a high risk area because current and emerging mission  critical skills gaps were undermining agencies\u2019 abilities to meet their vital  missions. To help close these skills gaps, we reported that actions were  needed in three broad areas: planning, to identify the causes of, and solutions for, skills gaps and to  identify the steps to implement those solutions; implementation, to put in place corrective actions to narrow skills gaps  through talent management and other strategies; and measurement and evaluation, to assess the performance of initiatives  to close skills gaps.", "Since our February 2011 update, OPM, individual agencies, and  Congress have taken a number of steps to close mission critical skills  gaps, but as we noted in our 2013 High Risk update, additional actions  were needed, as our work found that skills gaps were continuing in such  areas as cybersecurity, acquisition management, and aviation safety,  among others. These actions included reviewing the extent to which  new capabilities were needed, in order to give OPM and other agencies  greater visibility over government-wide skills gaps so that agencies could  take a more coordinated approach to remediating them. OPM agreed that  these were important areas for consideration.", "Since our 2011 High Risk update, OPM\u2019s efforts to address mission  critical skill gaps have included establishing the Chief Human Capital  Officers Council Working Group in order to identify and mitigate critical  skills gaps for both government-wide and agency-specific occupations  and competencies. Moreover, the Working Group\u2019s efforts were  designated a cross-agency priority goal within the administration\u2019s fiscal  year 2013 federal budget; OPM is partnering with the Chief Human  Capital Officer\u2019s Council to create a government-wide Human Resources  Information Technology strategy that can provide greater visibility to OPM  and agencies regarding current and emerging skills gaps."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Federal Civilian Workforce Grew by 14 percent from 2004 through 2012, and 14 percent of On Board Employees were Eligible to Retire in 2012", "paragraphs": ["From 2004 to 2012, the non-postal civilian workforce grew from 1.88  million to 2.13 million, an increase of 14 percent, or 258,882 individuals.
