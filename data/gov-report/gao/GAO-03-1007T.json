The Compact provided about $2.1 billion in U.S. funds, supplied by the Department of the Interior, over 17 years (1987-2003) to the FSM and the RMI. These funds were intended to advance economic development. In a past report, GAO found that this assistance did little to advance economic development in either country, and accountability over funding was limited. The Compact also established U.S. defense rights and obligations in the region and allowed for migration from both countries to the United States. The three parties recently renegotiated expiring economic assistance provisions of the Compact in order to provide an additional 20 years of assistance (2004-2023). In addition, the negotiations addressed defense and immigration issues. The House International Relations and Resources Committees requested that GAO report on Compact negotiations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The amended Compacts of Free Association between the United States and the FSM and the RMI to renew expiring U.S. assistance could potentially cost the U.S. government about $6.6 billion in new authorizations from the Congress. Of this amount, $3.5 billion would cover payments over a 20-year period (2004-2023), while $3.1 billion represents payments for U.S. military access to Kwajalein Atoll in the RMI for the years 2024 through 2086. While the level of annual grant assistance to both countries would decrease each year, contributions to trust funds--meant to eventually replace grant funding--would increase annually by a comparable amount. Nevertheless, at an assumed annual 6 percent rate of return, earnings from the FSM trust fund would be unable to replace expiring grant assistance in 2024, while earnings from the RMI trust fund would encounter the same problem by 2040. The amended Compacts strengthen reporting and monitoring measures that could improve accountability over assistance, if diligently implemented. These measures include the following: assistance grants would be targeted to priority areas such as health and education; annual reporting and consultation requirements would be expanded; and funds could be withheld for noncompliance with grant terms and conditions. The successful implementation of the many new accountability provisions will require appropriate resources and sustained commitment from the United States, the FSM, and the RMI. Regarding defense, U.S. military access to Kwajalein Atoll in the RMI would be extended from 2016 through 2066, with an option to extend through 2086. Finally, Compact provisions addressing immigration have been strengthened. For example, FSM and RMI citizens entering the United States would need to carry a passport, and the U.S. Attorney General could, through regulations, specify the time and conditions of admission to the United States for these citizens."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to testify on the Compact of Free  Association between the United States and the Pacific Island nations of  the Federated States of Micronesia, or the FSM, and the Republic of the  Marshall Islands, or the RMI. In 1986, the United States entered into this  Compact with the two countries after almost 40 years of administering the  islands under the United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. The  Compact has provided U.S. assistance to the FSM and the RMI in the form  of direct funding as well as federal services and programs for almost 17  years. Further, the Compact establishes U.S. defense rights and obligations  in the region and allows for migration from both countries to the United  States. Provisions of the Compact that address economic assistance were  scheduled to expire in 2001; however, they can remain and have remained  in effect while the United States and each nation renegotiated the affected  provisions.", "Today I will discuss our review of the amended Compacts and related  agreements that the United States signed with the FSM and the RMI in May  and April of 2003, respectively. (According to a Department of State  official, while the original Compact was one document that applied to both  the FSM and the RMI, the Compact that has been amended is now a  separate Compact with each nation.) Specifically, I will discuss changes to  levels and structure of future assistance, including the potential cost to the  U.S. government. Further, I will comment on changes in accountability  and other key issues addressed in the amended Compacts and related  agreements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The 1986 Compact of Free Association between the United States, the  FSM, and the RMI provided a framework for the United States to work  toward achieving its three main goals: (1) to secure self-government for  the FSM and the RMI, (2) to assist the FSM and the RMI in their efforts to  advance economic development and self-sufficiency, and (3) to ensure  certain national security rights for all of the parties. The first goal has been  met. The FSM and the RMI are independent nations and are members of  international organizations such as the United Nations.", "The second goal of the Compact\u2013advancing economic development and  self-sufficiency for both countries\u2013was to be accomplished primarily  through U.S. direct financial payments (to be disbursed and monitored by  the U.S. Department of the Interior) to the FSM and the RMI. For 1987  through 2003, U.S. assistance to the FSM and the RMI to support economic  development is estimated, on the basis of Interior data, to be about $2.1  billion. Economic self-sufficiency has not been achieved. Although total  U.S. assistance (Compact direct funding as well as U.S. programs and  services) as a percentage of total government revenue has fallen in both  countries (particularly in the FSM), the two nations remain highly  dependent on U.S. funds. U.S. direct assistance has maintained standards  of living that are higher than could be achieved in the absence of U.S.  support. Further, the U.S., FSM, and RMI governments provided little  accountability over Compact expenditures.", "The third goal of the Compact\u2013securing national security rights for all  parties\u2013has been achieved. The Compact obligates the United States to  defend the FSM and the RMI against an attack or the threat of attack in the  same way it would defend its own citizens. The Compact also provides the  United States with the right of \u201cstrategic denial,\u201d the ability to prevent  access to the islands and their territorial waters by the military personnel  of other countries or the use of the islands for military purposes. In  addition, the Compact grants the United States a \u201cdefense veto.\u201d Finally,  through a Compact-related agreement, the United States secured  continued access to military facilities on Kwajalein Atoll in the RMI  through 2016. In a previous report, we identified Kwajalein Atoll as the  key U.S. defense interest in the two countries. Of these rights, only the  defense veto is due to expire in 2003 if not renewed.", "Another aspect of the special relationship between the FSM and the RMI  and the United States involves the unique immigration rights that the  Compact grants. Through the original Compact, citizens of both nations  are allowed to live and work in the United States as \u201cnonimmigrants\u201d and  can stay for long periods of time, with few restrictions. Further, the  Compact exempted FSM and RMI citizens from meeting U.S. passport,  visa, and labor certification requirements when entering the United States.  In recognition of the potential adverse impacts that Hawaii and nearby  U.S. commonwealths and territories could face as a result of an influx of  FSM and RMI citizens, the Congress authorized Compact impact payments  to address the financial impact of these nonimmigrants on Guam, Hawaii,  and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). By 1998,  more than 13,000 FSM and RMI citizens had made use of the Compact  immigration provisions and were living in the three areas. The  governments of the three locations have provided the U.S. government  with annual Compact nonimmigrant impact estimates; for example, in  2000 the total estimated impact for the three areas was $58.2 million. In  that year, Guam received $7.58 million in impact funding, while the other  two areas received no funding.", "In the fall of 1999, the United States and the two Pacific Island nations  began negotiating economic assistance and defense provisions of the  Compact that were due to expire. Immigration issues were also addressed.  According to the Department of State, the aims of the amended Compacts  are to (1) continue economic assistance to advance self-reliance, while  improving accountability and effectiveness; (2) continue the defense  relationship, including a 50-year lease extension (beyond 2016) of U.S.  military access to Kwajalein Atoll in the RMI; (3) strengthen immigration  provisions; and (4) provide assistance to lessen the impact of Micronesian  migration on Hawaii, Guam, and the CNMI."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Amended Compacts Would Alter Assistance Levels and Structure", "paragraphs": ["Under the amended Compacts with the FSM and the RMI, new  congressional authorizations of approximately $3.5 billion in funding  would be required over the next 20 years, with a total possible  authorization through 2086 of $6.6 billion.

This decrease in grant funding, combined with FSM and RMI population  growth, would also result in falling per capita grant assistance over the  funding period\u2013particularly for the RMI. If the trust funds established in  the amended Compacts earn a 6 percent rate of return, the FSM trust fund  would be insufficient to replace expiring annual grants.

The share of new authorizations to the FSM would be about  $2.3 billion and would end after fiscal year 2023. The share of new  authorizations to the RMI would be about $1.2 billion for the first 20 years,  with about $300 million related to extending U.S. military access to  Kwajalein Atoll through 2023. Further funding of $3.1 billion for the  remainder of the period corresponds to extended grants to Kwajalein and  payments related to U.S. military use of land at Kwajalein Atoll.

This decrease in grant funding, combined with  FSM and RMI population growth, would also result in falling per capita  grant assistance over the funding period\u2013particularly for the RMI (see fig.  1). Using published U.S. Census population growth rate projections for the  two countries, the real value of grants per capita to the FSM would begin  at an estimated $687 in fiscal year 2004 and would further decrease over  the course of the Compact to $476 in fiscal year 2023. The real value of  grants per capita to the RMI would begin at an estimated $627 in fiscal  year 2004 and would further decrease to an estimated $303 in fiscal year  2023. The reduction in real per capita funding over the next 20 years is a  continuation of the decreasing amount of available grant funds (in real  terms) that the FSM and the RMI had during the 17 years of prior Compact  assistance.", "The decline in annual grant assistance could impact FSM and RMI  government budget and service provision, employment prospects,  migration, and the overall gross domestic product (GDP) outlook, though  the immediate effect is likely to differ between the two countries. For  example, the FSM is likely to experience fiscal pressures in 2004, when the  value of Compact grant assistance drops in real terms by 8 percent relative  to the 2001 level (a reduction equal to 3 percent of GDP). For the RMI,  however, the proposed level of Compact grant assistance in 2004 would  actually be 8 percent higher in real terms than the 2001 level (an increase  equal to 3 percent of GDP).

In designing the  trust funds, the Department of State assumed that the trust fund would  earn a 6 percent rate of return.
