Further, IRS lacks access to consistent and complete data on foreign financial assets and other data reported in tax filings by U.S. persons, in part, because some IRS databases do not store foreign asset data reported from paper filings. IRS has also stopped pursuing a comprehensive plan to leverage FATCA data to improve taxpayer compliance because, according to IRS officials, IRS moved away from updating broad strategy documents to focus on individual compliance campaigns. Ensuring access to consistent and complete data collected from U.S. persons\u2014and employing a plan to leverage such data\u2014would help IRS better leverage such campaigns and increase taxpayer compliance.", "Due to overlapping statutory reporting requirements, IRS and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)\u2014both within the Department of the Treasury (Treasury)\u2014collect duplicative foreign financial account and other asset information from U.S. persons. Consequently, in tax years 2015 and 2016, close to 75 percent of U.S. persons who reported information on foreign accounts and other assets on their tax returns also filed a separate form with FinCEN. The overlapping requirements increase the compliance burden on U.S. persons and add complexity that can create confusion, potentially resulting in inaccurate or unnecessary reporting. Modifying the statutes governing the requirements to allow for the sharing of FATCA information for the prevention and detection of financial crimes would eliminate the need for duplicative reporting. This is similar to other statutory allowances for IRS to disclose return information for other purposes, such as for determining Social Security income tax withholding.", "According to documents GAO reviewed, and focus groups and interviews GAO conducted, FFIs closed some U.S. persons' existing accounts or denied them opportunities to open new accounts after FATCA was enacted due to increased costs, and risks they pose under FATCA reporting requirements.

FATCA goes much  further, requiring FFIs to report more detailed information to IRS about  their U.S. customers annually. These provisions are important  developments in efforts to combat tax evasion by U.S. persons holding  investments in offshore accounts. FATCA generally requires certain  taxpayers to report foreign financial accounts and other specified foreign  financial assets whose aggregate value exceeds specified thresholds to  IRS on Form 8938. These taxpayers must report these assets and  income generated from such assets to IRS with their tax return on Form  8938. These thresholds vary by filing status\u2014such as single or married  filing jointly\u2014and by domestic or foreign residency.", "FATCA also promotes third-party reporting of foreign financial assets by  requiring a withholding agent to withhold 30 percent on certain payments  to an FFI unless the FFI or the jurisdiction in which the FFI is located has  entered into an agreement with the United States to report certain  account information of their U.S. customers. Under such an agreement,  participating FFIs report detailed information to IRS annually about  accounts held by their U.S. customers using an IRS Form 8966, FATCA  Report (Form 8966). According to IRS, FATCA improves visibility into  taxable income from foreign sources, and enhances the agency\u2019s ability  to identify and pursue taxpayer noncompliance. For example, FATCA  allows IRS to compare information reported by FFIs on Forms 8966 to  information reported by U.S. persons on Forms 8938. According to IRS,  this comparison can be used to ensure taxpayers and FFIs are properly  reporting foreign financial assets and income from international  investments. This type of comparison is a common IRS enforcement  technique. For example, IRS can directly compare information it receives  from financial institutions\u2019 IRS Form 1099-INT, Interest Income, against a  tax return to determine if the taxpayer reported income generated from  interest earned.", "To facilitate FATCA implementation for FFIs operating in jurisdictions with  laws that would prohibit FFIs from complying with the terms of the FFI  agreement, Treasury developed two alternative intergovernmental  agreements (IGA)\u2014Model 1 and Model 2\u2014to facilitate the effective and  efficient implementation of FATCA by removing partner jurisdictions\u2019 legal  impediments to comply with FATCA reporting requirements, and reducing  burdens on FFIs located in partner jurisdictions. FFIs from countries with  Model 1 IGAs report information on U.S. persons\u2019 accounts to their  respective host country tax authorities (HCTAs). The HCTAs, in turn,  compile the information from FFIs and transmit it to IRS. In contrast, FFIs  from countries with Model 2 IGAs, or countries treated as not having an  IGA in effect, directly report information on U.S. persons\u2019 accounts to IRS.", "Separate from the FATCA requirements, regulations implementing the  Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (BSA) also impose a separate self-reporting  requirement for foreign accounts. Specifically, certain taxpayers and  residents are required to file an FBAR with FinCEN annually if they have  financial interest or signature or other authority over one or more foreign  financial accounts with a total of more than $10,000, regardless of  whether they reside within or outside the United States. Federal, state,  and local law enforcement agencies can use information from these  reports to combat financial crimes, including terrorist financing and tax  evasion.

As part of this effort, IRS requires taxpayers to identify their  TINs on Forms 8938 they submit. IRS also requires participating FFIs to  report the TINs of each account holder who is a specified U.S. person on  Forms 8966. IRS intends to use reported TINs to link Form 8938 data  filed by taxpayers to Form 8966 data filed by the FFIs to ensure that  taxpayers and FFIs are properly reporting foreign financial assets.", "However, IRS often could not link account information collected from FFIs  to the account\u2019s owner because of incorrect or missing TINs. In July  2018, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA)  found that almost half of new Forms 8966 filed by FFIs did not include a  TIN or included an invalid TIN. A consulting firm working with FFIs to  implement FATCA reporting requirements told us that FFIs encountered  significant challenges obtaining accurate TINs from U.S. persons as part  of the self-certification process. For instance, FFIs encountered situations  where U.S. persons provided incomplete or inaccurate TINs\u2014such as  Social Security Numbers (SSN) with less than nine digits\u2014on forms used  to self-certify their status as U.S. persons. FFIs also encountered  situations where U.S. persons may not have obtained TINs or were  unwilling to provide them to FFIs.", "Additionally, banking associations told us that it has taken time, effort,  and expense for FFIs to report TINs, as they had to upgrade computer  systems to collect and record TINs from U.S. customers. Finally, Treasury  told us that jurisdictions that have an IGA with the United States but no  legal requirement to collect TINs are not in compliance with the  requirements of the IGA.", "Treasury and IRS determined that some FFIs reporting from countries  with Model 1 IGAs needed additional time to implement procedures to  obtain and report required U.S. TINs for preexisting accounts that are  U.S. reportable accounts. Consequently, IRS provided a transition period,  through the end of 2019, for compliance with the TIN requirements for  FFIs under Model 1 IGAs. Specifically, in September 2017, IRS issued a  notice modifying procedures for FFIs reporting from countries with Model  1 IGAs to become compliant with TIN reporting requirements for  preexisting accounts. For calendar years 2017-2019, IRS will not  determine that certain FFIs in countries with Model 1 IGAs are  significantly noncompliant with their obligations under the IGA solely as a  result of a failure to report U.S. TINs associated with the FFI\u2019s U.S.  reportable accounts, providing they (1) obtain and report the date of birth  of each account holder and controlling person whose TIN is not reported,  (2) make annual requests for missing TINs from each account holder, and  (3) search electronically searchable data maintained by such FFIs for  missing required U.S. TINs before reporting information that relates to  calendar year 2017 to a partner jurisdiction. As a result, even without  any further extensions, calendar year 2020 is the earliest IRS will be enforcing requirements for FFIs from countries with Model 1 IGAs to  provide accurate and complete information on U.S. account holders\u2019 TINs  to IRS.", "Without valid TINs on Forms 8966 submitted by FFIs, according to IRS  officials, IRS faces significant hurdles in matching accounts reported by  FFIs to those reported by individual tax filers on their Forms 8938. As a  result, IRS must rely on information such as names, dates of birth, and  addresses that the filers and/or FFIs may not consistently report. Without  data that can be reliably matched between Forms 8938 and 8966, IRS\u2019s  ability to identify taxpayers not reporting accurate or complete information  on specified foreign financial assets is hindered, interfering with its ability  to enforce compliance with FATCA reporting requirements, and ensure  taxpayers are paying taxes on income generated from such assets.", "In July 2018, TIGTA reported that IRS lacked success in matching FFI  and individual taxpayer data because reports FFIs filed did not include or  included invalid TINs. This, in turn, affected IRS\u2019s ability to identify and  enforce requirements for individual taxpayers. TIGTA recommended,  among other things, that IRS initiate compliance efforts to address and  correct missing or invalid TINs on Form 8966 filings from FFIs from  countries with Model 2 IGAs or without any IGAs with the United States.  IRS management said it disagreed with this recommendation because a  system to ensure validation of every TIN upon submission of a Form 8966  would be cost prohibitive. However, IRS management said that IRS would  address invalid TINs as they are uncovered on other compliance efforts,  such as initiating development of a data product to automate risk  assessments across the FATCA filing population. IRS also said it  continues efforts to systematically match Form 8966 and Form 8938 data  to identify nonfilers and underreporting related to U.S. holders of foreign  accounts. However, IRS management told us they are waiting until they  have a full set of data, including TINs, before doing analysis to develop a  compliance strategy. According to TIGTA, IRS management believed that  having the FFI\u2019s Global Intermediary Identification Number (GIIN) on  Form 8938, which is filed by the taxpayer, would help with matching  records. However, Form 8938 instructions identify that the field is optional  for taxpayers to complete. TIGTA recommended that to reduce taxpayer  burden in obtaining GIINs from FFIs, IRS add guidance to Form 8938  instructions to inform taxpayers on how to use the FFI List Search and  Download Tool on the IRS\u2019s website to obtain an FFI\u2019s GIIN. IRS  agreed with this recommendation. However, even if an individual taxpayer  provided GIINs, IRS may continue to have difficulty matching accounts  with U.S. taxpayers if the TIN and name of the account holder reported on  the Form 8966 do not match the TIN and name of the taxpayer on the  Form 8938.", "IRS officials said they are aware of these difficulties and have attempted  to match Forms 8938 and 8966 based on other criteria such as dates of  birth. In its response to our draft report, IRS said that all financial  institutions and foreign tax authorities that file required account  information receive a notification listing administrative and other minor  errors contained in their reporting. According to IRS, its Large Business  and International division follows up with foreign tax authorities regarding  these errors to ensure the tax authorities are working with financial  institutions to correct these errors in compliance with the countries\u2019 IGAs.  IRS added it has initiated a campaign addressing FFIs that do not meet  their compliance responsibilities with respect to account opening  requirements. Additionally, IRS drafted a risk acceptance form and tool  addressing risks in implementing FATCA compliance and business  process capabilities. This risk assessment focused on the limitations IRS  faces due to budget constraints, but did not address the specific risks it  faces from not receiving complete and valid TINs on U.S. account  holders. We previously reported that risk management could help  stakeholders make decisions about assessing risk, allocating resources,  and taking actions under conditions of uncertainty. Key management  practices for risk management we identified from our prior work include  identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing risks; developing a mitigation plan  to address identified risks; implementing the plan; and monitoring,  reporting, and controlling risks. Without developing a risk mitigation plan  to address risks IRS faces from not receiving complete and valid TINs  moving forward, IRS may lose opportunities to adjust its compliance  programs to better identify U.S. persons who are not fully reporting  specified foreign financial assets as required under FATCA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Databases Lack Consistent and Complete FATCA and Taxpayer Data Useful for Compliance Enforcement and Research", "paragraphs": ["Several IRS databases store data collected from individuals\u2019 electronic  and paper filings of Form 8938 and/or elements of parent individual tax  returns to which the Form 8938 is attached\u2014the filer\u2019s country of  residence and filing status\u2014used to determine specified reporting  thresholds for Form 8938 filers.

For example, five distinct  tables within CDW are required to identify the TIN, parent form, filing  status, country of residence, and amount of foreign assets accurately.  Without clear explanations of how data in each of these tables relate to  each other and to the underlying filings, errors could be introduced into  CDW users\u2019 analyses of foreign asset information.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government notes that  management should use quality information to achieve the entity\u2019s  objectives. One attribute of this principle includes processing data into  quality information that is appropriate, current, complete, accurate,  accessible, and provided on a timely basis. Additionally, the Internal  Revenue Manual states that IRS needs to measure taxpayer compliance  so that customer-focused programs and services can be enhanced or  developed so that compliance information and tools can be improved.", "According to IRS officials, IRS researchers have been taking additional  steps to obtain and review Form 8938 and parent tax return data stored in  the Integrated Production Model (IPM) database.

However, as  of February 2019, this effort has been delayed due to budget constraints.

The roadmap  also provided an overview of compliance activities used solely for  enforcing FATCA reporting requirements or enhancing existing  compliance efforts. However, in July 2018, TIGTA reported that IRS had  not updated the FATCA Compliance Roadmap since 2016, and had taken  limited or no action on a majority of the planned activities outlined in it.", "We also found that IRS had not yet evaluated the effects of FATCA,  including the effects on voluntary tax compliance. IRS documentation  states that only 7 of 31 capabilities outlined in the FATCA Compliance  Roadmap were delivered due to funding constraints. As of October 2018,  IRS has stopped using the FATCA Compliance Roadmap and has not  developed a revised comprehensive plan to manage efforts to leverage  FATCA data to improve taxpayer compliance. According to IRS officials,  IRS moved away from updating broad strategy documents, such as the  FATCA Compliance Roadmap, to focus on individual compliance  campaigns. These include a campaign to match individual tax filers to the  reports from FFIs, and another campaign to identify FFIs with FATCA  reporting requirements who are not meeting all of their obligations.", "According to what IRS told us, with the passage of time and as FATCA is  becoming more integrated into agency operations, it has moved from  updating the broad strategy documents focused on FATCA to working on  compliance campaigns that incorporate FATCA into overall tax  administration.

Based on available Form 8938 data from  tax year 2016, table 2 shows that about 61,900 filings from U.S. persons  living in the United States and about 11,600 filings from U.S. persons  living abroad during the same tax year reported specified foreign financial  assets with aggregate values at or below end of tax year thresholds.", "These totals likely understate the total number of Forms 8938 that U.S.  persons may have filed unnecessarily in tax year 2016; due to data  limitations, these totals exclude Forms 8938 without asset information  stored in IRS\u2019s databases, including most Forms 8938 filed on paper and  Forms 8938 where filers identified that they declared foreign financial  assets on other forms besides the Form 8938.", "There is no clear explanation as to why some U.S. persons may have  filed Forms 8938 unnecessarily. However, we identified a number of  potential reasons from focus groups and other interviews with stakeholder  groups. In focus groups we conducted, participants expressed confusion  about IRS\u2019s instructions for completing the Form 8938 and information  provided on IRS\u2019s website. In the instructions for completing Form 8938,  IRS described the specific types of foreign financial assets that are to be  reported on Form 8938, and the asset value thresholds that must be met  for required reporting, depending on the location of residence and filing  status of the taxpayer. IRS also posted responses to frequently asked  questions on meeting FATCA reporting requirements on its website, and  established a separate page on its website comparing foreign financial  assets that must be reported on Form 8938 and/or FBAR.", "Nonetheless, focus group participants reported confusion on whether and  how to report investment and retirement accounts and compulsory  savings plans managed by their country of residence. In a meeting we  convened with an organization representing tax attorneys, they told us  taxpayers are unsure about what account values to report on the Form  8938. Tax practitioners participating in another focus group added that  they filed Forms 8938 regardless of the aggregate value of the assets  because it was too cumbersome for them to identify whether the assets  exceeded reporting thresholds as of the end of the year or at any time  during the year.", "IRS officials also cited a number of possible reasons why U.S. persons  may be filing Forms 8938 unnecessarily. For example, it may be easier  for U.S. persons to report all specified foreign financial assets they hold  on the Form 8938, rather than determine whether the value of such  assets met applicable thresholds. IRS officials also said that U.S. persons  might complete a Form 8938 for reasons besides meeting tax-filing  requirements, such as providing evidence of assets for a loan application.", "IRS\u2019s Taxpayer Bill of Rights states that taxpayers are entitled to clear  explanations of the laws and IRS procedures in all tax forms, instructions,  publications, notices, and correspondence. Furthermore, one of IRS\u2019s  strategic goals is to empower taxpayers by making it easier for them to  understand and meet their filing, reporting, and payment obligations.  IRS officials said they hosted sessions for tax practitioners at IRS  Nationwide Tax Forums to address FATCA reporting requirements.  However, they said IRS has not taken direct steps to identify or  implement actions to further clarify instructions and related guidance on  IRS\u2019s website for completing Form 8938, such as information on which  foreign financial assets to report, how to calculate asset values, and  determine whether such values exceed required reporting thresholds.  Additionally, IRS officials said they have not conducted additional  outreach to educate taxpayers on required reporting thresholds under  FATCA, or notify Form 8938 filers of instances where aggregate values of  specified foreign financial assets reported on Forms 8938 were below  reporting thresholds.", "IRS officials said they have not made efforts to determine whether there  is a pattern of unnecessary Form 8938 filings that they could address.  Rather, they said they believed resources should be devoted to FATCA  implementation in general. However, as shown above, we have identified  many tens of thousands of instances where U.S. persons may have filed  Forms 8938 unnecessarily. Without assessing factors contributing to  unnecessary Form 8938 reporting\u2014and identifying or implementing  actions to further clarify and educate taxpayers on FATCA reporting  requirements\u2014IRS is missing opportunities to help taxpayers understand  their filing and reporting obligations and minimize their compliance  burdens while properly meeting their tax obligations.

Our  evaluation and management guide for fragmentation, overlap, and  duplication states that overlap occurs when multiple agencies or  programs have similar goals, engage in similar activities or strategies to  achieve them, or target similar beneficiaries. Table 3 shows that  individuals required to report foreign financial assets on Form 8938, in  many cases, also must meet FBAR reporting requirements. For example,  specified individuals with foreign financial accounts exceeding $50,000 in  aggregate value on the last day of the tax year must file both Form 8938  and FBAR if such values exceed the minimum Form 8938 thresholds;  these thresholds depend on the filing status and address of specified  individuals. Table 3 also shows that, in many cases, specified interests  in foreign financial assets as defined in Form 8938 instructions are the  same as the financial interest in such assets under FBAR. Further, as  noted in table 3, the overlapping requirements lead to IRS and FinCEN  collecting the same information on certain types of foreign financial  assets. For example, both Form 8938 and FBAR collect information on  foreign financial accounts for which a person has signature authority and  a financial interest in the account. Form 8938 and FBAR also both collect  duplicative information on several other types of foreign financial assets,  such as foreign mutual funds and accounts at a foreign financial  institution that include foreign stock or securities.", "Overlapping reporting requirements result in most Form 8938 filers also  filing an FBAR during the same reporting year. Table 4 shows that close  to 75 percent of Form 8938 filers in tax years 2015 and 2016 percent also  filed an FBAR for the same year using the same TIN.", "Overlapping requirements to file both Form 8938 and FBAR increases the  compliance burden on U.S. persons and adds complexity that can create  confusion, potentially resulting in inaccurate or unnecessary reporting.  Focus group participants in all five countries included in our study  affirmed that U.S. persons experienced confusion and frustration with  having to report duplicative foreign financial asset information on both  forms. Focus group participants and others we interviewed also noted  that U.S. persons incurred additional financial costs to complete and file  both Form 8938 and FBAR. For instance, one tax practitioner in Canada  said the charge was about $190 to report four-to-five accounts on an  FBAR in addition to charging about $540 for basic tax return packages.  An accounting firm based in Japan typically charged between $300 and  $800 to complete a Form 8938 and between $150 and $500 to complete  an FBAR, depending on the number of accounts reported on the forms.  Proposed revisions to regulations implementing BSA proposed by  FinCEN may also increase the number of duplicative foreign financial  accounts reported on Form 8938 and FBAR. Currently, U.S. persons  must report detailed information on all foreign financial accounts on Form  8938 if the value of such accounts and other specified foreign financial  assets reaches applicable reporting thresholds. In contrast, U.S.  persons are generally exempted from reporting detailed account  information on FBARs if they report having signature or other authority  over 25 or more foreign financial accounts. FinCEN\u2019s proposed revisions  to BSA regulations would eliminate the exemption, requiring U.S. persons  to report detailed information on all foreign financial accounts in which he  or she has a financial interest if the value of such accounts exceed  FBAR\u2019s $10,000 reporting threshold. FinCEN estimated that it will receive  account information for the first time on about 5.4 million foreign financial  accounts if it finalizes the proposed revisions. In turn, these revisions  may lead to increased filings of duplicative asset data on both Form 8938  and FBAR, as U.S. persons may have to report detailed information on all  foreign financial accounts using both forms.", "U.S. persons also face exposure to two different penalty regimes for any  failures in accurately and completely reporting foreign financial asset  information to two bureaus within Treasury\u2014IRS and FinCEN. Officials  from one organization representing U.S. persons living abroad said  penalties due to failure to report certain accounts on one or both forms  can be significant, even if little or no taxes are owed on those accounts.  The duplicative reporting of foreign financial asset data on two different  forms also creates additional costs to the government to process and  store the same or similar information twice, and enforce reporting  compliance with both requirements.", "In 2012, we recommended that Treasury direct the Office of Tax Policy,  IRS, and FinCEN to determine whether the benefits of implementing a  less duplicative reporting process exceed the costs and, if so, implement  that process. Treasury did not implement our recommendation. While  we continue to believe that the agencies should have considered whether  less duplicative reporting could have been implemented, we do recognize  that FATCA and FBAR were enacted under two different statutes to serve  different purposes. As mentioned above, according to IRS, FATCA  improves visibility into taxable income from foreign sources and enhances  the agency\u2019s ability to identify and pursue taxpayer noncompliance. In  contrast, the information reported on the FBAR is collected to identify  money laundering and other financial crimes; law enforcement agencies  can use BSA information\u2014including information collected from FBARs\u2014 to aid regulatory and criminal investigations. Additionally, data collected  from Form 8938 and FBAR are used in different systems for use by  different bureaus within Treasury. Fully addressing issues stemming from  overlapping reporting requirements and the resulting collection of  duplicative information\u2014while at the same time ensuring that such  information can be used for tax compliance and law enforcement  purposes\u2014can only be done by modifying the statutes governing the  requirements.", "Further, IRS and FinCEN have varying degrees of access to foreign  financial asset information collected from Form 8938 and FBAR to  enforce tax compliance and financial crime laws. FATCA was enacted, in  part, to improve visibility into taxable income from foreign sources.  However, information provided on Forms 8938 is taxpayer return  information protected by section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code  (IRC), which generally prohibits IRS from disclosing information provided  on Forms 8938. IRS can share return information with other government  agencies and others when it is allowed by statute. For example, under  section 6103, IRS may disclose return information related to taxes  imposed under the IRC\u2014such as self-employment income tax, Social  Security and Medicare tax and income tax withholding\u2014to the Social  Security Administration (SSA) as needed to carry out its responsibilities  under the Social Security Act. However, according to FinCEN officials,  FinCEN, law enforcement, and regulators often cannot access  information submitted on Forms 8938. While section 6103 provides other  exceptions to disclosure prohibitions\u2014such as allowing IRS to share  return information with law enforcement agencies for investigation and  prosecution of nontax criminal laws\u2014such information is generally only  accessible pursuant to a court order.", "As noted above, information reported on the FBAR can be used by law  enforcement agencies to aid regulatory and criminal investigations. This  includes IRS, which has been delegated responsibility from FinCEN to  enforce compliance with FBAR reporting requirements. IRS has used  FBAR information in addressing taxpayer noncompliance with reporting  and paying taxes on foreign assets and income. For example, taxpayers  accepted into one of IRS\u2019s offshore voluntary disclosure programs must  have filed amended or late FBARs as part of their program applications.  Investigators from IRS\u2019s Criminal Investigation division generally reviewed  applications to determine if the taxpayer has made a complete and  truthful disclosure. IRS examiners can also use information from case  files of program participants\u2014such as information disclosed on FBARs\u2014 to identify new groups of taxpayers suspected of hiding income offshore.  IRS can then choose to continue offering offshore programs and  encourage these newly identified groups of taxpayers, as well as all  taxpayers with unreported offshore accounts, to disclose their accounts  voluntarily.", "In addition to eliminating overlapping reporting requirements, harmonizing  statutes governing foreign financial asset reporting and use of information  collected on such assets to make such statutes fully consistent could  yield additional benefits to both IRS and the law enforcement community.  Specifically, and as shown in appendix IV, there are specified foreign  financial assets reported on Form 8938\u2014such as foreign hedge funds  and foreign private equity funds\u2014that are not required to be reported on  an FBAR. In contrast, there are other specified foreign financial assets  reported on an FBAR\u2014such as indirect interests in foreign financial  assets through an entity\u2014that are not required to be reported on Form  8938. Without congressional action to address overlap in foreign financial  asset reporting requirements, IRS and FinCEN will neither be able to  coordinate efforts to collect and use foreign financial asset information,  nor reduce unnecessary burdens faced by U.S. persons in reporting  duplicative foreign financial asset information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FFIs Face Overlapping Foreign Account Reporting Systems, but Alignment Would Entail Significant Changes in Law", "paragraphs": ["Two reporting systems for sharing foreign account information from  foreign financial institutions are in operation globally\u2014FATCA and the  Common Reporting Standard (CRS). According to officials from banking  associations and a consulting firm, FFIs in the countries where we  examined FATCA implementation encountered challenges implementing  and now maintaining two overlapping reporting systems for collecting and  transmitting account information to other countries for a seemingly similar  purpose, and collecting sufficient information from customers to ensure  they meet the requirements of both systems. As noted above, we  previously identified overlap as occurring when multiple agencies or  programs have similar goals, engage in similar activities or strategies to  achieve them, or target similar beneficiaries.", "According to an IRS official, collecting account information under FATCA  ushered in an era of greater transparency; as noted above, FATCA\u2019s  passage sought to reduce tax evasion by creating greater transparency  and accountability with respect to offshore accounts and other assets  held by U.S. taxpayers. When FATCA was first introduced, there was no  international platform to share account information between countries.  The United States and other countries worked together to reach an  agreement on the electronic formatting that would be used to share the  information.", "Other countries tax authorities\u2019 became more interested in understanding  the financial assets held abroad by their residents through an exchange  of account information among themselves. In response, the Organisation  for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) established the  CRS reporting system for automatic exchange of information among  member countries. According to the OECD, CRS was developed with a  view to maximize efficiency and reduce cost for financial institutions.  Thus, CRS drew extensively on the intergovernmental approach used to  implement FATCA reporting requirements for FFIs. Countries  participating in CRS exchange account information with each other using  OECD\u2019s Common Transmission System, which was modeled on  FATCA\u2019s International Data Exchange System. Figure 2 depicts the flow  of account information between countries under FATCA and CRS.", "CRS reporting requirements are in many ways similar to FATCA,  including required reporting of the account holders\u2019 name and address,  taxpayer identification number, account number, account balance, and  income and sales proceeds. However, the requirements differ in  significant ways. The biggest differences in requirements are driven by  the nature of the U.S. tax system. The United States, like many countries,  generally taxes citizens and resident aliens on their worldwide income  regardless of where that income is earned. However, the United States  differs from other countries because it generally subjects U.S. citizens  who reside abroad to U.S. taxation in the same manner as U.S. residents.  In contrast to U.S. policy, most other countries do not tax their citizens if  they reside in a country other than their country of citizenship. Further,  IGAs implementing FATCA require FFIs to report the foreign-held  accounts of U.S. citizens and residents\u2014including resident aliens\u2014while  CRS requires financial institutions in jurisdictions participating in CRS to  report on almost all accounts held by nonresidents of the reporting  country. Appendix V provides more detailed information on differences in  reporting requirements, due diligence requirements, and definitions under  FATCA and CRS.", "These differences in tax systems drive variations in due diligence  procedures between FATCA and CRS. For example, FATCA aims to  identify whether an account holder at a foreign institution is a U.S. person  based on citizenship and tax residency information. In contrast, CRS  aims to identify the tax residency of all account holders of a financial  institution, and does not consider citizenship. Due to the multilateral  nature of CRS, if an account holder is determined on the basis of the due  diligence procedures to have residency in two or more countries,  information would be exchanged with all jurisdictions in which the account  holder is determined a resident for tax purposes. Under CRS rules,  information about foreign accounts held by a U.S. citizen with a tax  residence abroad would not be reported to IRS, but rather to the  jurisdiction in which they were a resident for tax purposes. Because the  United States taxes the worldwide income of U.S. citizens, CRS rules  would need to require identification of account holders\u2019 citizenship in  member countries where they are residents if FATCA were to be aligned  with CRS. Table 5 shows a comparison of individuals reported to IRS  under FATCA and hypothetically under CRS.", "Treasury and IRS, as part of its 2017-2018 Priority Guidance Plan, are  considering modifying certain elements of the existing FATCA  regulations. For instance, Treasury and IRS are considering coordinating  certain documentation requirements for participating FFIs with the  requirements under IGAs. In December 2018, Treasury and IRS also  proposed regulations intended, in part, to reduce the burdens of  FATCA. The proposed regulations included a clarification of the  definition of an investment entity that is similar to the guidance published  by OECD interpreting the definition of a \u201cmanaged by\u201d investment entity  under CRS.", "If the United States wanted to adopt CRS, some of the key differences  between FATCA and CRS\u2014as outlined above and in appendix V\u2014could  be aligned through regulation while others would require legislation.  According to Treasury officials, to align FATCA and CRS, Congress  would need to revise statutes to: provide for the collection of information for accounts that residents of  partner jurisdictions maintain at U.S. financial institutions;  require certain U.S. financial institutions to report the account balance  (including, in the case of a cash value insurance contract or annuity  contract, the cash value or surrender value) for all financial accounts  maintained at a U.S. office and held by foreign residents; expand the current reporting required with respect to U.S. source  income paid to accounts held by foreign residents to include similar  non-U.S. source payments;  require financial institutions to report the gross proceeds from the sale  or redemption of property held in, or with respect to, a financial  account; and  require financial institutions to report information with respect to  financial accounts held by certain passive entities with substantial  foreign owners.", "While better aligning FATCA and CRS to some extent is possible,  anything short of the United States fully adopting CRS would not fully  eliminate the burdens of overlapping requirements that FFIs must  currently meet under the two different systems. While having the United  States adopt the CRS reporting system in lieu of FATCA could benefit  FFIs that may otherwise have to operate two overlapping reporting  systems, it would result in no additional benefit to IRS in terms of  obtaining information on U.S. accounts. Additionally, it could generate  additional costs and reporting burdens to U.S. financial institutions that  would need to implement systems to meet CRS requirements. The extent  of these costs is unknown. Further, adoption of CRS would create the  circumstance where foreign accounts held by U.S. citizens with a tax  residence in partner jurisdiction\u2014including U.S. citizens who have a U.S.  tax obligation\u2014would not be reported to IRS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Coordinated Efforts to Address Challenges U.S. Persons Living Abroad Encountered from FATCA Implementation, but Opportunities Exist to Enhance Collaboration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Some U.S. Persons Living Abroad Encountered Reduced Access to Financial Services Due in Part to Costs and Risks FFIs Faced from Implementing FATCA", "paragraphs": ["Tax practitioners and others we interviewed said that U.S. persons living  abroad\u2014whether or not they are required to complete a Form 8938\u2014risk  being denied access to foreign financial services.

One focus group participant, for example, said that the financial institution  closed down all accounts including business checking, savings, and  money market accounts after FATCA was implemented, requiring this  individual to find a local resident who could co-sign on a new account.", "Costs FFIs would incur from implementing FATCA were cited as a  significant factor in increasing barriers faced by U.S. persons in accessing  foreign financial services. Officials from one organization representing tax  attorneys said that as a result of costs associated with FATCA  implementation, FFIs have found it less burdensome to close accounts of  U.S. persons or require the accounts to be moved to a Securities and  Exchange Commission registered affiliate than comply with FATCA. Tax  practitioners and an official from a bankers association added that  because FFIs may gain only small margins of profit from U.S. persons,  FFIs may believe it is too troublesome to do business with them.  Additionally, officials from a foreign government agency told us that  because FATCA is expensive for FFIs to continue implementing, banks in  their country might charge U.S. persons seeking access to financial  services additional fees to account for FATCA implementation costs. Tax  practitioners, consultants working with FFIs to implement FATCA  reporting requirements, and the National Taxpayer Advocate told us that  FFIs with smaller asset sizes such as smaller trust companies were more  prone to decline business with U.S persons. Officials from an advocacy  group representing U.S. persons living abroad told the National Taxpayer  Advocate that some smaller banks declined U.S. persons as customers  as a business decision, believing it would cost more for them to comply  with FATCA reporting requirements than maintain U.S. expatriates\u2019  accounts.", "Banking associations we interviewed said that decisions made by FFIs on  whether to accept U.S. persons as customers also depends on the overall  risks and benefits of taking on individual U.S. persons, shaped in part  from risks in not meeting FATCA reporting requirements. Representatives  of a banking association and an advocacy group told us that some FFIs  decided to avoid doing business with U.S. persons after they became  concerned about potential penalties for failure to comply\u2014either willfully  or in error\u2014with FATCA reporting requirements. One banking association  added that such errors could affect other aspects of FFIs\u2019 relationships  with the U.S. government, such as nonprosecution agreements made  with the U.S. Department of Justice.", "Officials from one consulting firm that helped FFIs meet FATCA reporting  requirements added that FFIs\u2019 determination of risk depends on many  layers, such as the value of clients\u2019 assets or the country in which clients  reside or possess citizenship. After FATCA\u2019s implementation, according  to officials from the consulting firm, FFIs decided to turn away U.S.  persons in some cases because the benefits of doing business with U.S.  persons were less than the potential risks. For example, if a U.S. person  only maintained a payroll account, the FFI may determine it would not  make enough money to account for risks in incorrectly identifying the  status of the customer as a U.S. or non-U.S. person. However, focus  group participants from two countries said that FFIs may agree to accept  U.S persons as customers if they have higher account balances that  offset risks from FATCA reporting requirements. One focus group  participant, for instance, said banks in his country will do business with a  U.S. person if he or she has more than $500,000 in assets.

Treasury and Department of Commerce officials stationed in one country  included in our review added that FATCA implementation has played a  role in dissuading foreign-owned corporations in some Asian countries  from considering U.S. persons for corporate leadership positions such as  directorships.

Two advocacy groups representing U.S. persons living  abroad added that it is also harder for U.S.-based companies to justify  relocating U.S. persons overseas and paying for such relocations since  they also have had to help their U.S. employees meet Form 8938  reporting requirements in addition to meeting other tax filing  requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Persons Living Abroad Encounter Challenges Obtaining Social Security Numbers Necessary to Meet U.S. Tax Obligations and Obtain Financial Services", "paragraphs": ["U.S. embassy documents indicate there was increased demand for Social  Security Numbers (SSN) since FATCA\u2019s passage in 2010, driven in part  by U.S. citizens applying for an SSN to gain access to foreign financial  services or resolve outstanding U.S. tax obligations before completing  renunciation. However, officials from two organizations representing  Americans living abroad cited significant challenges faced by some U.S.  persons living abroad in obtaining SSNs required to meet their U.S. tax  obligations or obtain financial services. U.S. persons living abroad might  not possess an SSN because their parents did not obtain one for them as  a minor. Often, this may have been due to the parents leaving the United  States when the child was young. State officials also said that U.S.  citizens applying for U.S. passports while overseas frequently forget their  SSNs or do not know if their parents ever applied for an SSN on their  behalf. Officials from organizations representing U.S. persons living  abroad added that without an SSN, these persons are unable to claim  refunds or other tax benefits when filing their tax returns, or participate in  IRS programs to voluntarily disclose previously unreported tax liabilities  and assets. Additionally, some might be unable to gain or maintain  access to financial accounts or other assets in their countries of residence  without an SSN. According to these officials and tax practitioners we  interviewed, U.S. persons living abroad face greater challenges in  obtaining SSNs than those living in the United States. For instance, they  faced difficulties obtaining documentation from the United States that the  Social Security Administration (SSA) requires with SSN applications;  traveling to Social Security offices and U.S. embassies or consulates to  certify documents or submit applications in person; and receiving valid  SSNs from SSA in a timely manner to file tax returns or participate in  offshore disclosure programs.", "SSA officials also identified several challenges U.S. persons experience  when applying for an SSN from abroad.

Similarly, in 2017, SSA and State  implemented an interagency agreement to streamline processes for  providing SSNs to U.S. persons living abroad after FATCA\u2019s  implementation in 2010. SSA officials said they are also in discussions  with State on improving SSA\u2019s website to include more transparent,  specific information for SSN overseas applicants about SSA  documentation requirements.", "Tax practitioners, advocacy groups, and Treasury officials we interviewed  said FFIs have become more willing to accept U.S. persons as customers  compared to when FATCA was enacted in 2010. However, U.S. persons  living abroad continue to face issues gaining access to foreign financial  services. For example, in a September 2018 letter sent by the Chair of  the Finance Committee of the Netherlands House of Representatives to a  member of Congress, U.S. citizens born outside the United States and  who have never lived, studied, or worked in the United States are  effectively being denied access to financial services in the Netherlands.  Focus group participants added that some banks will reject U.S. clients or  charge heavy fees for them to open an account.", "Agencies have ongoing efforts to address FATCA-related issues, as listed  below, but some are ad hoc, fragmented, or otherwise not part of a  broader effort between Treasury and other agencies such as State or  SSA to use ongoing collaborative mechanisms to monitor and share  information on such issues, and jointly develop and implement steps to  address them:", "Treasury officials said they are participating in discussions with FFIs  to address residual issues with access to foreign financial services.  However, they said they have not involved other agencies in these  discussions.", "IRS officials, in response to concerns from the French government,  said they are developing a program to help streamline foreign asset- related tax compliance requirements for a small group of U.S. born  citizens that have been French residents most of their lives without an  SSN, and\u2014according to State officials\u2014did not wish to take the  necessary steps to renounce their citizenship. However, no effort has  been made to address these issues more broadly.", "State encouraged U.S. citizens to alert the nearest U.S. embassy of  any practices they encounter with regard to the provision of financial  services. State documents noted that some Americans have been  turned away by banks or required to meet a higher deposit threshold  in part because of FATCA reporting requirements. State  documentation also noted that there have been cases of U.S. citizens  with existing bank accounts who have been asked to close them.  However, State documentation we reviewed does not highlight  collaborative efforts currently underway with Treasury or other  agencies to address banking access issues U.S. persons living  abroad are presently encountering worldwide.", "As described above, SSA and State streamlined processes and  policies for U.S. persons abroad seeking to obtain SSNs. However,  SSA officials said they have not been involved in any ongoing efforts  involving Treasury to identify systemic issues and related solutions  involving SSNs for the purposes of tax compliance and citizenship  renunciations. Treasury officials said they spoke with SSA officials  about problems U.S. persons living abroad face in obtaining SSNs,  but SSA believed that cycle times for processing SSN applications  submitted by U.S. persons living abroad were not significantly greater  than for applications submitted by U.S. persons living in the United  States, although mailing times could vary significantly and take up to 3  to 6 months.", "We have previously identified key practices to enhance and sustain  interagency collaboration, including defining and articulating a common outcome, establishing mutually reinforcing or joint strategies, and developing mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and report on results.", "One goal in IRS\u2019s strategic plan is to collaborate with external partners  proactively to improve tax administration, while objectives in SSA\u2019s  strategic plan include improving service delivery and expanding service  delivery options. Additionally, according to State\u2019s Bureau of Consular  Affairs website, one of State\u2019s key priorities is to protect the interests of  U.S. citizens overseas, such as through ensuring responsive and efficient  provision of consular services overseas. As noted above, there are a host  of ongoing issues and challenges for U.S. persons living abroad from  implementation of FATCA, such as loss of access to foreign financial  services, denial of employment and promotion opportunities overseas,  and difficulty obtaining SSNs from abroad. However, Treasury currently  lacks a collaborative mechanism to coordinate efforts with other agencies  to address these issues, and Treasury officials said they do not plan to  establish them.

Because of FATCA, IRS receives information on foreign  financial assets from hundreds of thousands of filers annually. IRS could  use this information to help ensure taxpayers holding offshore assets  report and pay taxes owed on income generated from such assets.  However, to take full advantage of the information, IRS must address key  challenges. Specifically, Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TIN) reported  by FFIs are often inaccurate or incomplete, which makes it difficult for IRS  to match information reported by FFIs to individual taxpayers. As such,  IRS must develop a plan to mitigate the risks that these data issues pose  to agency efforts to identify and combat taxpayer noncompliance.", "Lack of consistent, complete, and readily available Form 8938 and related  parent individual tax return data also affects IRS\u2019s compliance activities,  making it more difficult for IRS business units to extract and analyze  FATCA data to improve tax compliance efforts and reduce tax revenue  loss from income generated from offshore assets. At the same time, IRS  has stopped following its FATCA Compliance Roadmap it developed in  2016 because, according to IRS officials, IRS moved away from updating  broad strategy documents to focus on individual compliance campaigns.  However, in light of the challenges IRS continues to face in fully  integrating FATCA information into its compliance programs, it will not  maximize use of such information and effectively leverage individual  compliance campaigns unless it employs a comprehensive plan that  enables IRS to better leverage such campaigns to improve taxpayer  compliance.", "Our analysis of available data indicates that many of the Forms 8938 filed  in tax year 2016 may have been filed unnecessarily. Factors that are  contributing to this unnecessary reporting are unclear. While IRS has  provided instructions and guidance on its website for completing Form  8938, focus group participants and tax practitioners reported confusion on  whether and how to report investments in foreign accounts. Taking steps  to identify and address factors contributing to unnecessary Form 8938  reporting would help reduce taxpayer burden and reduce processing  costs for IRS.", "Reporting requirements for foreign financial assets under FATCA overlap  with reporting requirements under FBAR. These overlapping  requirements\u2014implemented under two different statutes\u2014have resulted  in most taxpayers filing Forms 8938 also filing FBARs with FinCEN.  Duplicative filings on foreign financial assets cause confusion, frustration,  and compliance burdens for taxpayers. Duplicative filings also increased  costs to the government to process and store the same or similar  information. Modifying the statutes governing the requirements can fully  address the issues outlined above, and can allow for the use of FATCA  information for prevention and detection of financial crimes. This is similar  to other statutory allowances for IRS to disclose return information for  other purposes, such as for determining Social Security income tax  withholding.", "Lastly, FATCA has created challenges for some U.S. persons living  abroad that go beyond increasing their tax compliance burdens. Some  U.S. persons living abroad are still facing issues accessing financial  services and employment and obtaining SSNs. Treasury, State, and SSA  have taken some steps to address these issues both separately and in  coordination with each other. However, Treasury, as the agency  ultimately responsible for effective administration of FATCA, currently  lacks a collaborative mechanism with State and SSA to address ongoing  issues.

IRS also said that it continued to make  progress on improving FATCA filing compliance, citing efforts such as  initiating a campaign addressing FFIs that do not meet their compliance  responsibilities.

While implementing enforcement activities could increase  compliance with FATCA reporting requirements, it risks not maximizing  the value of such efforts without a comprehensive plan to manage and  address the myriad of challenges discussed in this report.

We identified  criteria from our prior work identifying key practices for risk management.  The key practices are derived from the Software Engineering Institute\u2019s  Capability Maturity Model\u00ae Integration for Development and Office of  Management and Budget guidance. We applied these criteria to assess  steps IRS has taken to manage risks in not receiving complete and valid  TIN information from FFIs. We also applied criteria from our prior work on  use of documented frameworks to IRS documentation on FATCA  compliance activities to determine the extent to which IRS implemented a  comprehensive plan to maximize use of collected data to enforce  compliance with FATCA.", "For our second objective, we identified total maximum account values  reported by individual filers of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network  (FinCEN) Form 114s (commonly known as the Report of Foreign Bank  and Financial Accounts, or FBAR) in calendar years 2015 and 2016. See  appendix III for more details on our methodology to evaluate these data.  We also summarized the numbers of IRS Forms 8938, Statement of  Specified Foreign Financial Assets (Form 8938) filed in tax year 2016,  accounting for the data limitations described below. We also identified  Forms 8938 filed in tax year 2016\u2014the most recent year for which data  were available\u2014with available residency and asset information that  reported specified foreign financial assets with aggregate values at or  below end-of-year tax thresholds, which vary depending on the location of  residence and filing status of such filers.", "For our third objective, we reviewed IRS and FinCEN documentation, and  applied criteria from Fragmentation, Overlap, and Duplication: An  Evaluation and Management Guide to identify the extent to which IRS  and FinCEN were engaged in overlapping activities, and collecting  duplicative information on foreign financial assets held by U.S. persons.  We assessed the extent to which individual filers who submitted a Form  8938 in 2015 and 2016 also submitted an FBAR for the same year by  determining the number and percentage of Forms 8938 with TINs that  also match the TIN listed on the corresponding FBAR for the same year.", "For the three objectives described above, we assessed the reliability of  data submitted on Forms 8938 filed by individuals for tax years 2015 and  2016, the most recent data available.

We also assessed the reliability of data from FBARs for calendar  years 2015 and 2016 by (1) reviewing documentation about the data and  the systems that produced them; (2) conducting electronic tests, such as  identifying data with significant numbers of missing Form 8938 or FBAR  records, or values of foreign financial assets reported outside an  expected range; (3) tracing selections or random samples of data to  source documents; and (4) interviewing IRS and FinCEN officials  knowledgeable about the data. We also reviewed Form 8938 and relevant  parent tax return data stored in IRS databases to determine whether IRS  management is using quality information collected from Forms 8938 to  achieve its objectives, as defined in our Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government. We determined that data extracted from IRTF  on characteristics of Form 8938 filers and from FBAR filings was  sufficiently reliable for our purposes, subject to caveats identified in this  report.
