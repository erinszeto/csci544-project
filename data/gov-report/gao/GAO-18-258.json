To provide insight into these issues, this report examines (1) patterns in disciplinary actions among public schools, (2) challenges selected school districts reported with student behavior and how they are approaching school discipline, and (3) actions Education and Justice have taken to identify and address disparities or discrimination in school discipline. GAO analyzed discipline data from nearly all public schools for school year 2013-14 from Education's Civil Rights Data Collection; interviewed federal and state officials, as well as officials from a total of 5 districts and 19 schools in California, Georgia, Massachusetts, North Dakota, and Texas. We selected these districts based on disparities in suspensions for Black students, boys, or students with disabilities, and diversity in size and location. We also reviewed federal laws and a non-generalizable sample of seven recently resolved federal school discipline investigations (selected in part based on the type of alleged discrimination). We incorporated technical comments from the agencies as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Black students, boys, and students with disabilities were disproportionately disciplined (e.g., suspensions and expulsions) in K-12 public schools, according to GAO's analysis of Department of Education (Education) national civil rights data for school year 2013-14, the most recent available. These disparities were widespread and persisted regardless of the type of disciplinary action, level of school poverty, or type of public school attended. For example, Black students accounted for 15.5 percent of all public school students, but represented about 39 percent of students suspended from school\u2014an overrepresentation of about 23 percentage points (see figure).", "Officials GAO interviewed in all five school districts in the five states GAO visited reported various challenges with addressing student behavior, and said they were considering new approaches to school discipline. They described a range of issues, some complex\u2014such as the effects of poverty and mental health issues. For example, officials in four school districts described a growing trend of behavioral challenges related to mental health and trauma. While there is no one-size-fits-all solution for the issues that influence student behavior, officials from all five school districts GAO visited were implementing alternatives to disciplinary actions that remove children from the classroom, such as initiatives that promote positive behavioral expectations for students.", "Education and the Department of Justice (Justice) documented several actions taken to identify and address school discipline issues.

Starting in pre-school,  children as young as 3 and 4 have been suspended and expelled from  school, a pattern that can continue throughout a child\u2019s education.  Research has shown that students who are suspended from school lose  important instructional time, are less likely to graduate on time, and are  more likely to repeat a grade, drop out of school, and become involved in  the juvenile justice system. The effects of certain discipline events, such  as dropping out, can linger throughout an individual\u2019s lifetime and lead to  individual and societal costs. For example, one study of California youth  estimated that students who dropped out of high school due to  suspensions would result in about $2.7 billion in costs for the state,  stemming from lost wages and tax revenue, increased crime, and higher  welfare and health costs. Another study estimated that Florida high  school students who drop out earn about $200,000 less over their  lifetimes than high school graduates.", "We were asked to report on the issue of discipline in schools.

CRDC collects a range of  information, including discipline data, from nearly every public school by  student demographics (e.g., race, sex, disability) and school type (e.g.,  magnet or charter). The CRDC captures data on six broad categories of  discipline: (1) out-of-school suspensions, (2) in-school suspensions, (3)  referrals to law enforcement, (4) expulsions, (5) corporal punishment, and  (6) school-related arrests. It does not capture data on less severe  disciplinary actions, such as detentions. Using the CRDC, we also  developed a regression model to explore whether certain school  characteristics, such as the poverty level of the school, were associated  with higher rates of certain disciplinary actions. Our analyses of these  data, taken alone, do not establish whether unlawful discrimination has  occurred. We determined these data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report by reviewing documentation, conducting electronic  testing, and interviewing Education officials.", "To obtain information on how selected school districts are addressing  discipline issues, we interviewed state education, school district, and  school officials in five states (California, Georgia, Massachusetts, North  Dakota, and Texas). We selected one district in each state, and 19  schools within those districts, to serve as illustrative (non-generalizable)  examples based on several criteria, including the presence of disparities  in suspensions from school for Black students, boys, or students with  disabilities, as reported in Education\u2019s CRDC data, size of the district,  and geographic diversity.", "To determine how Education and Justice are identifying and addressing  discipline disparities and discrimination, we interviewed agency officials  and reviewed agency documentation, administrative data, federal laws  and regulations, and a non-generalizable selection of resolved school  discipline investigations undertaken by Education and Justice (which we  refer to as cases). We selected four school discipline cases from  Education and three from Justice that covered pre-kindergarten through  grade 12 students, included a mix of types of alleged discrimination (e.g.,  based on race or disability status) and types of discipline (e.g.,  suspension, expulsion, arrest, etc.), and were resolved between 2014 and  May 2017. Regarding administrative data, Education provided information  from its internal database on the number of complaints received and cases investigated that were categorized as being related to school  discipline.

Studies we  reviewed suggest that implicit bias\u2014stereotypes or unconscious  associations about people\u2014on the part of teachers and staff may cause  them to judge students\u2019 behaviors differently based on the students\u2019 race  and sex. Teachers and staff sometimes have discretion to make case- by-case decisions about whether to discipline, and the form of discipline  to impose in response to student behaviors, such as disobedience,  defiance, and classroom disruption. Studies show that these decisions  can result in certain groups of students being more harshly disciplined  than others. Further, the studies found that the types of offenses that  Black children were disciplined for were largely based on school officials\u2019  interpretations of behavior. For example, one study found that Black girls  were disproportionately disciplined for subjective interpretations of  behaviors, such as disobedience and disruptive behavior. A separate  study used eye-tracking technology to show that, among other things,  teachers gazed longer at Black boys than other children when asked to  look for challenging behavior based on video clips. The Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS) reported that this research has  highlighted implicit bias as a contributing factor in school discipline and  may shed some light on the persistent disparities in expulsion and  suspension practices, even though the study did not find that teacher  gazes were indicative of how they would discipline students.", "Children\u2019s behavior in school may be affected by health and social  challenges outside the classroom that tend to be more acute for poor  children, including minority children who experience higher rates of  poverty.

Further, a substantial share of  children nationwide are estimated to have experienced at least one  trauma, referred to as an adverse childhood experience (ACE), according  to the National Survey of Children\u2019s Health. Additionally, as we recently  reported, there has been an increase in certain mental health issues  within the school age population. For example, from 2005 to 2014, the  suicide rate of youth ages 15 to 19 rose slightly, with older youth having a  much higher rate of suicide than younger youth, and since 2007, the  percentage of youth ages 12-17 experiencing a major depressive episode  increased."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "K-12 Students and Discipline", "paragraphs": ["About 50 million students were enrolled in K-12 public schools during the  2013-14 school year, according to the CRDC.

Several school officials noted a range of issues, including complex issues  such as the effects of poverty, mental health issues, and family  dysfunction, that they said contributed to behavior that leads to discipline  (see fig. 8). For example, officials at a high-poverty Georgia high school  said that their students have additional responsibilities, such as raising or  watching siblings or working to support their family, which may cause  students to be late to, or skip, class. This observation is consistent with  our recent report on child well-being, which cited research showing that  children in poverty are more likely to face academic and social challenges  than their peers, and with our analysis of CRDC data, which showed that  rates of chronic absenteeism (being absent 15 or more days in a school  year), were higher in high-poverty schools. See appendix IV, table 19  for detailed data on chronic absenteeism. At one high school in Georgia,  officials said that attendance issues were the reason for a majority of  disciplinary actions at their school. They said that if students were repeatedly late to school or did not get to their next class within the set  amount of time, students could amass enough infractions to warrant  suspension from school. In contrast, an official at an elementary school in  Georgia said that they usually do not discipline their students for being  late to school, as they have found that it was often due to circumstances  beyond the child\u2019s control. According to several school officials, some  groups such as homeless youth, American Indian, or Lesbian, Gay,  Bisexual, Transgender, or Questioning (LGBTQ) students have had  greater attendance problems than others. For example, education officials  in California said that homeless and foster youth frequently miss school  because of all the transitions and instability in their lives. In a school in  Texas, officials also reported attendance issues with students who are  homeless or in foster care because they lack transportation and clothing.  Similarly, we previously reported that American Indian students face  school attendance challenges, including access to reliable  transportation. In addition, American Indian and Alaska Native students  had the highest rates of chronic absenteeism in school year 2013-14,  compared to students of other races, according to our analysis of CRDC  data (see appendix IV). LGBTQ students are at a high risk of suicide and  other emotional issues during adolescence, and often feel disconnected  from their peers and families, according to county education officials in  California. According to these officials, this can contribute to attendance  problems.", "Officials in our five selected school districts also described what they  perceived as a growing trend of behavioral challenges or provided  examples related to mental health and trauma, such as increased  anxieties, thoughts of and attempts at suicide, and depression among  students. For example, state education officials in Georgia said they  viewed a growing number of their students as being \u201ctrauma complex.\u201d  Officials at one school in Massachusetts said that they involve the mental  health clinicians or social worker for additional support when students are  dealing with traumatic experiences, depression, or are struggling to self- regulate. Further, officials at another school in Massachusetts said that  many of their students have experienced trauma and this may lead to  more aggressive behaviors at the elementary school level, and to more  self-destructive behaviors at the middle school level. Specifically, these  officials said that children who have experienced trauma may kick, bite,  and punch others when they are younger and cut themselves or become  suicidal when older. Similarly, officials at a school in Texas said that they  have seen a growth in suicidal ideation and self-harm among the  students. Some school officials also said that they felt ill-equipped or that  schools lacked resources to deal with the increase in students with  mental health issues and the associated behaviors.", "School officials in all five of the selected states also said that social media  results in conflicts or related behavioral incidents among students, such  as related bullying and arguments. Officials at a school in Georgia said  that social media arguments can cause students who were not part of the  original situation to be pulled in, creating classroom disruptions that end  in discipline for a larger group. Moreover, officials in a North Dakota  middle school said that disagreements on social media last for longer  periods of time. They said that social media has also been used to  facilitate the purchase of illegal drugs, which can result in students being  arrested in school and expelled.", "Use of Corporal Punishment in School for  Five Selected States  California, Massachusetts, and North Dakota:  Corporal punishment in schools is prohibited.  Texas: If a school district adopts a policy to  permit corporal punishment, school staff may  use corporal punishment unless the student\u2019s  parent has provided a written, signed  statement prohibiting it. None of the schools  GAO visited used corporal punishment,  according to officials.  Georgia: Boards of education are authorized  to determine policies related to corporal  punishment, including allowing school staff, at  their discretion, to administer corporal  punishment in order to maintain discipline.  However, none of the schools GAO visited  used corporal punishment, according to  officials.", "School district officials from three of the five selected districts we visited  stated that officials at individual schools generally have a lot of discretion  in determining what discipline a student receives. In several schools,  officials said they often try other avenues first to address behavior, such  as detention, alerting or having a discussion with the parent, or taking  away certain privileges such as making the student eat lunch with the  teacher instead of with their friends. However, for certain offenses,  officials in most districts said that discipline was automatically more  severe. Gun possession, for example, prompts an automatic expulsion at  most of the school districts we visited. In another example, school  district officials in Texas said drug-related incidents, physical assault of a  teacher or student, or extreme sexual behaviors can result in a student  being placed in an alternative school. School officials at one alternative  school we visited stated that 80 to 90 percent of their students are there  due to drug-related incidents. Officials in several of the school districts  said their districts had School Resource Officers who only become  involved in school disciplinary issues when requested by school  administrators. In a Texas high school with over 3,800 students, a school  official said School Resource Officers patrol school grounds, monitor  gang activity, and may become involved when there are illegal drug  issues. Officials also said that School Resource Officers sometimes  provide trainings for students, parents, or school staff on subjects such as  safety, good decision making, substance abuse, and peer pressure.  Further, although corporal punishment was legal in two of the five states  we visited (see sidebar), the school district officials with whom we spoke  in those states said it was not used anymore in their districts.

Some  school officials said they have begun to specifically address disparities for  certain student groups. Officials in all selected school districts reported  they are implementing efforts to better address student behavior or  reduce the use of exclusionary discipline. For example, officials in all  school districts said that they are implementing alternative discipline  models that emphasize preventing challenging student behavior and  focus on supporting individuals and the school community, such as  positive behavioral interventions and supports (PBIS), restorative justice  practices, and social emotional learning (SEL) (see sidebar). For  example, officials at a selected school district in Texas said they have  implemented a classroom management model that uses positive behavior  techniques. Texas state law allows schools to develop and implement  positive behavior programs as disciplinary alternatives for very young  students. This was also true in California, where state law specifically  lists suggested alternatives to suspension, including restorative justice, a  positive behavior support approach with tiered interventions, and  enrollment in programs that teach positive social behavior or anger  management.", "Examples of Alternatives to Discipline that  Removes Students from the Classroom  Positive Behavioral Interventions and  Supports (PBIS): A school-wide framework  that focuses on positive behavioral  expectations.

All of the  selected school districts used some form of  positive behavioral intervention and supports.  One school official told us that PBIS has  significantly reduced their discipline referral  numbers and provided teachers more tools to  get behavior situations under control.  Restorative Justice Practices: This approach  focuses on repairing harm done to  relationships and people. The aim is to teach  students empathy and problem-solving skills  that can help prevent inappropriate behavior  in the future. For example, according to  officials we interviewed at one school, their  restorative practices help students take  ownership of their actions and work  collaboratively to restore relationships that  may have been strained. Officials at another  school said schools use mediation techniques  as alternatives to suspensions.  Social and Emotional Learning (SEL): SEL  enhances students\u2019 abilities to deal effectively  and ethically with daily tasks and challenges.  SEL integrates the following five core  competencies: self-awareness, self- management, social awareness, relationship  skills, and responsible decision making. At a  school implementing this model, officials said  that they are strengthening their SEL program  to improve the whole child instead of treating  discipline and mental and behavioral health  separately.", "With regard to directly addressing disparities in school discipline, officials  at one school district in California said they created a new leadership  team for equity, culture, and support services, and developed a district- wide equity plan that includes mandatory training on implicit bias for  principals. Officials from that district also said they had recently changed  a policy to increase the consistency of discipline actions across the  district\u2019s schools. Similarly, officials at a school district in Massachusetts  reported they were working to build awareness among school leadership  to address racial bias and the achievement gap through multiyear  trainings. Officials we spoke with at a school within that district said they  conduct trainings for staff on implicit bias and other related issues to  reduce school discipline disparities. As some of the schools and districts  we visited have begun implementing alternative discipline models and  efforts to reduce the use of exclusionary discipline in recent years, we  heard from officials in two districts that there has been difficulty with  implementation due to limited resources, staffing turnover, and resistance  on the part of some parents.", "During our visits to schools, we observed classroom spaces that school  officials used to manage student behavior, including through various  alternative approaches to discipline (see fig. 9). Officials in two school  districts said they are moving away from exclusionary discipline because  it decreases the amount of academic instruction. Officials at one school  district in Georgia said that the district had a history of overusing  exclusionary discipline and they understood that schools cannot \u201csuspend  their way out of behavioral and discipline issues.\u201d Officials at that district  said they are currently rolling out PBIS to their schools, although progress  has been slow. While they said discipline rates have decreased and they  have received fewer parent and staff complaints, change is difficult  because of limited resources, staff turnover, and some resistance to  alternative discipline versus punitive discipline on the part of both some  school staff and parents.", "State education officials in all five states said that changes to state law  were made or considered related to school discipline in the past several  years. For example, California officials said that state law now prohibits  suspensions and expulsions for children in grades K-3 for willful  defiance. For all ages suspensions may only be used when other  means of correction fail to bring about proper conduct. Similarly,  Massachusetts law requires that during a student meeting or a hearing to  decide disciplinary consequences for a student, school administrators  consider ways to re-engage students in the learning process and that  expulsion only be used after other remedies and consequences have  failed.

These cases  stemmed both from external complaints and reviews self-initiated by  Education. When we analyzed a non-generalizable sample of resolved  cases, we found that most of them focused on alleged racial  discrimination or disability status. In the four cases we selected for more  in-depth review, the school districts agreed to address discipline issues  by, for example, designating a discipline supervisor, training staff, revising  district policies, holding student listening sessions, and regularly  reviewing data to identify disparities (see case descriptions below).  Some of these remedies are designed to reduce exclusionary discipline  or improve overall school climate, and others are more directly focused  on addressing disparities in school discipline. For example, having school  leadership regularly review data, particularly when disaggregated by race  and other student characteristics, would increase awareness of  disparities.", "Education Case 1: Race and Exclusionary Discipline in a Mississippi  School District. OCR\u2019s 2014 investigation of the Tupelo Public School  District found that Black students were disproportionately disciplined in  nearly all categories of offenses. These commonly included subjective  behaviors like disruption, defiance, disobedience, and \u201cother misbehavior  as determined by the administration.\u201d The consequences for \u201cother  misbehavior\u201d in high school could be severe, ranging from detention to  referral to an alternative school. Once at the alternative school, students  were searched thoroughly each day upon entry, escorted by security  officers when changing classes, and not allowed to carry purses or book  bags. OCR concluded that the district\u2019s discipline codes afforded  administrators broad discretion, and found different treatment of Black  students when looking at specific disciplinary records. For example,  among several students who were disciplined for the first offense of using  profanity, Black students were the only ones who were suspended from  school, while White students received warnings and detention for  substantially similar behavior. To address these issues, the district entered into a voluntary resolution agreement whereby it committed to  taking specific actions to ensure that all students have an equal  opportunity to learn in school. It agreed, among other things, to revise its  student discipline policies, practices, and procedures to include clear and  objective definitions of misconduct, eliminate vague and subjective  offense categories, and describe criteria for selection within the range of  possible penalties when imposing sanctions. The district also agreed to  require that alternatives to suspension and other forms of exclusionary  discipline be considered in all cases except where immediate safety of  students or staff is threatened, and where the behavior in question is such  that the disruption to the educational environment can only be remedied  by removal, or where the student\u2019s removal is a result of the district\u2019s  progressive discipline policy.", "Education Case 2: Disability and Restraint & Seclusion in a Non- Public California School. This 2016 OCR investigation focused on  restraint and seclusion of a student with disabilities who was placed at the  non-public school with which Oakland Unified School District contracted  to provide the student with certain services, including developing and  implementing behavior intervention plans. OCR found the use of prone  restraint on this student to be severe, persistent, and pervasive: staff held  the student face-down 92 times over a period of 11 months, with the  longest duration of a single face-down restraint being 93 minutes.  Examples of behaviors that led to the use of restraint included disruptive  behavior, not following directions, pushing desks, and ripping up  assignments. Staff said that the student wanted to be disciplined and  understood prone restraint to be disciplinary. OCR determined that the  district allowed the student to be treated differently for non-dangerous  behavior on the basis of disability. The district entered into a resolution  agreement, committing to resolve these issues by offering individual relief  to the student\u2014arranging for an evaluation of the student for adverse  effects of the restraint and seclusion, with recommendations for  addressing areas of harm\u2014and implementing district-wide policy changes  related to restraint and seclusion.

In this 2014 case, OCR found that Christian County  School District disciplined Black students more frequently or harshly than  similarly situated White students. Specifically, Black students were more  than 10 times more likely than White students to receive out-of-school  suspension for disorderly conduct, and Black students were more likely to  be assigned to an \u201cIsolated Classroom Environment\u201d when discipline was  for a violation that afforded discretion. OCR also found that the district\u2019s  discipline code did not define 61 types of violations, including ones that  involve interpretation, such as disorderly conduct, failure to follow  directions, deliberate classroom disruption, and profanity. OCR found that  administrators had wide discretion in determining the consequences for  such actions, and noted that the discipline code allowed for virtually every  type of sanction, including expulsion, for each type of violation. OCR also  found inconsistencies in treatment of students in different racial groups  when looking at individual records (see sidebar). Although district officials  said they were aware of the higher rates of discipline for Black students,  OCR found that there were no safeguards to ensure that discretion would  be exercised in a nondiscriminatory manner.

School administrators confirmed the  practice of \u201cearly dismissal\u201d in response to misbehavior, but said they did  not consider the dismissal to be disciplinary. Because the school did not  maintain records of these removals, OCR was unable to determine if the  student was subjected to discriminatory discipline. However, OCR noted  that the practice of removing students from school for disciplinary reasons  without appropriate recordkeeping and due process makes it almost  impossible for the school to assess whether it is fully meeting its duty of  ensuring nondiscrimination with respect to discipline.

Our analyses of this data, taken alone, do not  establish whether unlawful discrimination has occurred. The CRDC is a  biennial survey that is mandatory for every public school and district in the  United States. Conducted by Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, the  survey collects data on the nation\u2019s public schools (pre-K through 12th  grade), including disciplinary actions as well as student characteristics  and enrollment, educational and course offerings, and school  environment, such as incidents of bullying. CRDC data are self-reported  by districts and schools, and consequently there is potential for  misreporting of information. In school years 2011-12 and 2013-14, the  CRDC collected data from nearly every public school in the nation  (approximately 17,000 school districts, 96,000 schools, and 50 million  students in school year 2013-14).

The CRDC did not collect data on less severe  forms of discipline, such as detentions, Saturday school, or removing  privileges to engage in extracurricular activities, such as athletic teams or  field trips. As shown in table 4, we combined related variables for out-of- school suspension and expulsion; we also provide a crosswalk of  discipline variables used in this report and those captured in the CRDC.", "For each of the six disciplinary actions in our review, we examined  discipline counts and rates both overall and disaggregated by student  demographic characteristics. Specifically, we examined counts and rates  for each disciplinary action by student sex (boy or girl), race or ethnicity  (see table 5), disability status (students with or without disabilities), and  English Language Learners. Using the CRDC, we also examined race  and sex intersectionally, for example, disciplinary rates for Black boys or  White girls.", "In order to analyze discipline counts and rates by the poverty level of the  school, we pulled in data on free or reduced-price lunch eligibility from the  2013-14 Common Core of Data (CCD), and matched it to schools in the  2013-14 CRDC, which did not collect eligibility data. The CCD is  administered by Education\u2019s National Center for Education Statistics, and  annually collects nonfiscal data about all public schools in the nation.

Though an interaction may be \u201cnegative,\u201d it does not necessarily  imply that the group presented in the interaction was significantly less  likely to receive the given disciplinary action because interactions are  interpreted relative to the main effect of each variable in the interaction.

With  regard to size, we collapsed several categories that Education has  previously used into three groupings, each with roughly one-third of all  students attending public schools in school year 2013-14:", "Large School District: 25,000 or more students (34.7% of all  students in 2013-14)", "Medium School District: 5,000 to 24,999 students (33.2% of all  students in 2013-14)", "Small School District: Less than 5,000 students (32.1% of all  students in 2013-14)", "Further, we focused on out-of-school suspensions for selection purposes  because this disciplinary action was one of the most frequently reported  disciplinary actions employed by schools in Education\u2019s two most recent  data collection efforts on the issue (2011-12 and 2013-14 CRDC).  Moreover, out-of-school suspensions are an exclusionary disciplinary  action; that is, they remove or exclude students from the usual  instructional or learning environment. Selecting districts with a range of  out-of-school suspension rate was intended to generate a mix of districts  that commonly use exclusionary discipline, as well as those that may  employ alternatives.", "For site selection, we used out-of-school suspension data in two ways.  First, we excluded districts that did not have a disparity in out-of-school  suspension rates for Black students, boys, or students with disabilities.  Prior GAO work and Education\u2019s data showed that these groups were  particularly vulnerable to discipline disparities, and the purpose of this  research objective was to understand district efforts to identify and  address such disparities. Second, we grouped school districts by whether  their out-of-school suspension rate increased or decreased between  2011-12 and 2013-14. Exploring school districts that changed in different  ways over time was intended to help us identify successful efforts to  reduce suspensions as well as challenges districts face in addressing  disparate discipline.", "Using the above criteria, we grouped school districts into the following  categories:", "Category 1 and 2: Large school district and out-of-school suspension  rate that increased (or decreased) from 2011-12 to 2013-14", "Category 3 and 4: Medium school district and out-of-school  suspension rate that increased (or decreased) from 2011-12 to 2013- 14", "Category 5 and 6: Small school district and out-of-school suspension  rate that increased (or decreased) from 2011-12 to 2013-14.", "After sorting school districts into the above categories, we randomized the  list within each category to improve the methodological rigor of selecting  school districts. In addition, we applied a series of post-checks to our list  of districts in each grouping to ensure we had appropriate variety to  consider other key factors in school discipline. Specifically, we checked  for variety in:  types of public schools in the district, geographic diversity both in terms of region of the country and use of corporal punishment in the district, and use of restraint or seclusion in the district.", "To select specific districts, we started with the district in each category  that was at the top of the randomized list and then applied the above  post-checks. We then conducted outreach to district superintendents or  their designees via telephone and email to obtain their agreement to  participate in this review. When school districts were unresponsive to our  outreach or unwilling to participate, we contacted additional districts that  had similar characteristics in order to achieve variety in our final  selections. This resulted in the selection of five schools districts, one each  in California, Georgia, Massachusetts, North Dakota, and Texas (see  table 11).", "We visited each district and interviewed district-level officials involved in  school discipline and school climate initiatives. These officials included  superintendents, assistant superintendents, program managers, and  directors of applicable district departments (e.g., student support services  and special education). We also reviewed district-level discipline data,  school district discipline policies, and relevant state laws related to school  discipline to better understand the local context in each selected district.", "In the five districts we visited, we also interviewed officials at a total of 19  schools. At each school, we typically met with principals and/or assistant  principals, and in some instances, spoke with other personnel at the  school, such as counselors, attendance coordinators, school resource  officers (i.e., law enforcement officers), and teachers. In each district, we  selected a variety of schools to visit based on grade level, school type,  and disciplinary data.", "For each selected district, we also interviewed officials from the state  educational agency that oversees that district to better understand the  statewide context around discipline, such as state laws that may affect  district disciplinary policies, statewide initiatives related to discipline, and  state-level monitoring of district-level disciplinary actions. In California, we  also met with the county office of education that oversees the district we  selected because, in that state, counties have a primary role in the local  school district accountability structure.", "Because we selected these school districts judgmentally, we cannot  generalize the findings about these districts\u2019 approaches to discipline, and  the challenges they face, to all school districts and schools nationwide."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Review of Federal Actions", "paragraphs": ["To determine the extent to which, and in what ways, Education and  Justice are identifying and addressing discipline disparities and  discrimination, we interviewed agency officials at headquarters and  regional offices, reviewed agency documentation and administrative data,  reviewed federal laws and regulations, and reviewed a non-generalizable  sample of seven recently resolved school discipline investigations  undertaken by Education and Justice (which we refer to as cases). With  both agencies, we interviewed officials about each agency\u2019s  responsibilities with respect to federal civil rights laws and regulations, as  well as the actions the agencies took to enforce them. We also discussed  each agency\u2019s guidance, support to school districts on these issues (e.g.,  grants and technical assistance), and data collection activities. In  addition, we collected and reviewed relevant agency procedures and  guidance documents. We also requested and reviewed Education\u2019s data  on the number of civil rights complaints received and cases related to  school discipline investigated from 2011 to August 2017 to better  understand the scope of the agency\u2019s efforts. Education provided these  data from their internal database, where investigators categorized cases  as being related to school discipline. We assessed the reliability of this  source through discussion with knowledgeable officials and reviewing key  documents and determined the data to be reliable for our purposes.", "To select resolved school discipline cases to review, we searched  Education\u2019s and Justice\u2019s respective online repositories of resolved  investigations and compliance reviews, as well as Education\u2019s annual  reports, to create a list of resolved cases related to school discipline. We  then narrowed the list to cases resolved in approximately the past 3 years  (from 2014 to May 2017) and excluded long-standing cases that were  opened several decades ago to help ensure the information in the cases  reflected recent policies and practices in each agency. We also excluded  cases regarding institutions of higher education because they were  outside the scope of this review. This resulted in a list of 12 relevant  resolved cases\u20149 for Education and 3 for Justice. From this list, we  selected 7 cases to review in depth to better understand Education\u2019s and  Justice\u2019s investigatory processes and resolutions with regard to school  discipline cases in pre-K through 12th grade, and to provide illustrative  examples in our report. We selected 4 cases from Education that  provided a mix of the type of alleged discrimination (e.g., race or  disability) and type of discipline (e.g., suspension, expulsion, arrest, etc.).  We selected all 3 relevant cases from Justice. For each case, we  reviewed the type of investigation (complaint investigation or compliance  review); the reason for the investigation; any applicable findings or  recommendations; and the ultimate resolution of the investigation, such  as a voluntary agreement with the school district or remedies to address  findings. In all instances, we are presenting Education\u2019s and Justice\u2019s  findings and do not reach any independent conclusions regarding the  cases.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2016 to March  2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
