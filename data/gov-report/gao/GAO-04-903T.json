Peace Corps has hired an analyst to enhance data collection and analysis to help the agency develop better-informed intervention and prevention strategies. In 2002, we reported that Peace Corps had developed safety and security policies but that efforts to implement these policies in the field had produced varying results. Some posts complied, but others fell short. Volunteers were generally satisfied with training. However, some housing did not meet standards and, while all posts had prepared and tested emergency action plans, many plans had shortcomings. Evidence suggests that agency initiatives have not yet eliminated this unevenness. The inspector general continues to find shortcomings at some posts. However, recent emergency action plan tests show an improved ability to contact volunteers in a timely manner. In 2002, we found that uneven supervision and oversight, staff turnover, and unclear guidance hindered efforts to ensure quality practices. The agency has taken action to address these problems. To strengthen supervision and oversight, it established an office of safety and security, supported by three senior staff at headquarters, nine field-based safety and security officers, and a compliance officer. In response to our recommendations, Peace Corps was granted authority to exempt 23 safety and security positions from the \"5-year rule\"--a statutory restriction on tenure.

The administration intends to increase this  number to about 14,000 over the next few years, and Congress has  increased appropriations for the Peace Corps to support this expansion.  Volunteers often live in areas with limited access to reliable  communications, police, or medical services. As Americans, they may be  viewed as relatively wealthy and, hence, good targets for criminal activity.  In many countries, female volunteers face special challenges; more than a  third of female volunteers report experiencing sexual harassment on at  least a monthly basis.", "My testimony today will summarize and update, where possible, key  findings from our 2002 report related to (1) trends in crime against  volunteers and the agency\u2019s system for generating such information, (2)  the agency\u2019s field implementation of its safety and security framework,  and (3) the underlying factors that contributed to Peace Corps\u2019  performance in the field. I will also discuss actions that Peace Corps has  taken to improve the safety and security of its volunteers since we issued  our report.", "We conducted fieldwork at Peace Corps\u2019 headquarters and visited five  countries with Peace Corps programs to prepare our report. To develop  our analysis, we    analyzed Peace Corps\u2019 crime data;  reviewed agencywide safety and security policies, guidelines, training  materials, volunteer satisfaction surveys, and Inspector General reports; interviewed key staff and more than 150 volunteers; and   examined practices for selecting volunteer sites, developing emergency  action plans, and performing other tasks.", "We conducted our work from July 2001 through May 2002 and from  February 2004 through March 2004, in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.", "In summary, we found the following:  Peace Corps\u2019 reported incidence rates of crimes committed against  volunteers have remained essentially unchanged since we last reported.  Reported rates for most types of assaults have increased since Peace  Corps began collecting data in 1990, but reported rates have stabilized in  recent years. For example, the reported incidence rate for major physical  assaults nearly doubled from an average of about 9 per 1,000 volunteer  years in 1991-1993 to an average of about 17 per 1,000 volunteer years in  1998-2000. Data for 2001 and 2002 show that this rate has not changed. The  full extent of crime against Peace Corps volunteers is unknown because  there is significant underreporting of crime by volunteers. We reported  that Peace Corps had initiated efforts to encourage reporting and collect  additional data but that there were also other unrealized opportunities for  additional examination of data. For example, our analysis showed that  newer volunteers may be more likely to become victims of crime than  their more experienced colleagues. In response to our findings, in April  2003, Peace Corps hired an analyst to enhance its capacity for gathering  and analyzing crime data. The analyst has focused on upgrading the crime  data system and shifting the responsibility for data collection and analysis  from the medical office to the newly created safety and security office, to  place the responsibility for crime data in an office dedicated to safety and  security. According to the analyst, additional crime analyses have not yet  been conducted, as the focus has been on upgrading the process for  collecting and reporting data.", "We reported that Peace Corps\u2019 headquarters had developed a safety and  security framework but that the field\u2019s implementation of the framework  had produced varying results. While volunteers were generally satisfied  with the agency\u2019s training programs, there was mixed performance in key  elements of the framework such as in developing safe and secure housing  sites, monitoring volunteers, and planning for emergencies. For example,  at each of the five posts we visited, we found instances of volunteers who  began their service in housing that had not been inspected and had not  met Peace Corps\u2019 guidelines. We also found that the frequency of staff  contact with volunteers and the quality and comprehensiveness of  emergency action plans varied. Recent tests of the emergency action plans  indicate that the agency has made improvements in the length of time  needed to contact volunteers. To improve safety and security practices in  the field, in 2002, the agency increased the number of field-based safety  and security officers charged with reviewing post practices and assisting  them in making improvements, and created a safety and security position  at each post. Peace Corps hired a compliance officer charged with  independently assessing each post\u2019s compliance with the framework.  However, recent Inspector General reports indicate that safety and  security shortcomings in the field are still occurring.", "We reported that a number of factors, including staff turnover, informal  supervision and oversight mechanisms, and unclear guidance hampered  Peace Corps\u2019 efforts to ensure high-quality performance for the agency as  a whole. For example, Peace Corps reported that high staff turnover,  caused in part by the agency\u2019s statutorily imposed 5-year limit on  employment for U.S. direct hire staff, had resulted in a lack of institutional  memory, producing a situation in which agency staff are continually  \u201creinventing the wheel.\u201d We made a recommendation that Peace Corps  develop a strategy to address staff turnover, including an assessment of  the \u201c5-year rule\u201d\u2014a statutory restriction on the tenure of U.S. direct hire  employees. In response to our recommendation on staff turnover and the  difficulties it created, Peace Corps was granted authority to exempt safety  and security staff from the 5-year rule. The agency has exempted 23 staff  positions from the 5-year rule and plans to conduct a study to determine  whether there are additional positions that should be exempted. To  strengthen supervision and oversight, Peace Corps created an office of  safety and security that centralizes safety and security functions under an  associate directorship. The office is supported by a staff member in each  of the three regional bureaus, a compliance officer, an analyst, and nine  field-based security officers. We also recommended that Peace Corps  develop performance indicators and report on its safety and security  initiatives. The agency is still clarifying its guidance on how to apply its  revised framework, revising its indicators of progress, and establishing a  base line for judging performance in all areas of safety and security.", "In conclusion, since we issued our report in July 2002, it is clear that the  agency has taken a number of steps designed to improve the safety and  security of its volunteers. However, Peace Corps is still in the process of  implementing many of these actions and their full effect has yet to be  demonstrated."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Created in 1961, Peace Corps is mandated by statute to help meet  developing countries\u2019 needs for trained manpower while promoting  mutual understanding between Americans and other peoples. Volunteers  commit to 2-year assignments in host communities, where they work on  projects such as teaching English, strengthening farmer cooperatives, or  building sanitation systems. By developing relationships with members of  the communities in which they live and work, volunteers contribute to  greater intercultural understanding between Americans and host country  nationals. Volunteers are expected to maintain a standard of living similar  to that of their host community colleagues and co-workers. They are  provided with stipends that are based on local living costs and housing  similar to their hosts. Volunteers are not supplied with vehicles. Although  the Peace Corps accepts older volunteers and has made a conscious effort  to recruit minorities, the current volunteer population has a median age of  25 years and is 85 percent white. More than 60 percent of the volunteers  are women.", "Volunteer health, safety, and security is Peace Corps\u2019 highest priority,  according to the agency. To address this commitment, the agency has  adopted policies for monitoring and disseminating information on the  security environments in which the agency operates, training volunteers,  developing safe and secure volunteer housing and work sites, monitoring  volunteers, and planning for emergencies such as evacuations.  Headquarters is responsible for providing guidance, supervision, and  oversight to ensure that agency policies are implemented effectively.  Peace Corps relies heavily on country directors\u2014the heads of agency  posts in foreign capitals\u2014to develop and implement practices that are  appropriate for specific countries. Country directors, in turn, rely on  program managers to develop and oversee volunteer programs. Volunteers  are expected to follow agency policies and exercise some responsibility  for their own safety and security. Peace Corps emphasizes community  acceptance as the key to maintaining volunteer safety and security. The  agency has found that volunteer safety is best ensured when volunteers  are well integrated into their host communities and treated as extended  family and contributors to development."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reported Crime Incidents Have Increased, but Full Extent of Crime against Volunteers Remains Unknown", "paragraphs": ["Reported incidence rates of crime against volunteers have remained  essentially unchanged since we completed our report in 2002.

Reported incidence rates for  major assaults remained unchanged over the next 2 years. Reported  incidence rates of major sexual assaults have decreased slightly, averaging  about 10 per 1,000 female volunteer years in 1991-1993 and about 8 per  1,000 female volunteer years in 1998-2000.

Peace Corps officials agreed that  reported increases are difficult to interpret; the data could reflect actual  increases in assaults, better efforts to ensure that agency staff report all  assaults, and/or an increased willingness among volunteers to report  incidents. The full extent of crime against volunteers, however, is  unknown because of significant underreporting. Through its volunteer  satisfaction surveys, Peace Corps is aware that a significant number of  volunteers do not report incidents, thus reducing the agency\u2019s ability to  state crime rates with certainty. For example, according to the agency\u2019s  1998 survey, volunteers did not report 60 percent of rapes and 20 percent  of nonrape sexual assaults. Reasons cited for not reporting include  embarrassment, fear of repercussions, confidentiality concerns, and a  belief that Peace Corps could not help.", "In 2002, we observed that opportunities for additional analyses existed  that could help Peace Corps develop better-informed intervention and  prevention strategies. For example, our analysis showed that about a third  of reported assaults after 1993 occurred from the fourth to the eighth  month of service\u2014shortly after volunteers completed training, arrived at  sites, and began their jobs.

In both the 1998 and 1999  volunteer satisfaction surveys, over 90 percent of volunteers rated safety  and security training as adequate or better; only about 5 percent said that  the training was not effective. Some regional safety and security officer  reports have found that improvements were needed in post training  practices. The Inspector General has reported that volunteers at some  posts said cross-cultural training and presentations by the U.S. embassy\u2019s  security officer did not prepare them adequately for safety-related  challenges they faced during service.

For example, one volunteer  spent her first 3 weeks at her site living in her counterpart\u2019s office. She  later found her own house; however, post staff had not inspected this  house, even though she had lived in it for several months. Poorly defined  work assignments and unsupportive counterparts may also increase  volunteers\u2019 risk by limiting their ability to build a support network in their  host communities. At the posts we visited, we met volunteers whose  counterparts had no plans for the volunteers when they arrived at their  sites, and only after several months and much frustration did the  volunteers find productive activities.", "We found variations in the frequency of staff contact with volunteers,  although many of the volunteers at the posts we visited said they were  satisfied with the frequency of staff visits to their sites, and a 1998  volunteer satisfaction survey reported that about two-thirds of volunteers  said the frequency of visits was adequate or better. However, volunteers  had mixed views about Peace Corps\u2019 responsiveness to safety and security  concerns and criminal incidents. The few volunteers we spoke with who  said they were victims of assault expressed satisfaction with staff  response when they reported the incidents. However, at four of the five  posts we visited, some volunteers described instances in which staff were  unsupportive when the volunteers reported safety concerns. For example,  one volunteer said she informed Peace Corps several times that she  needed a new housing arrangement because her doorman repeatedly  locked her in or out of her dormitory.

According to a June 2001 Peace Corps workforce analysis, turnover among  U.S. direct hires was extremely high, ranging from 25 percent to 37 percent  in recent years.

Several Peace Corps officials stated that turnover affected the agency\u2019s  ability to maintain continuity in oversight of post operations.", "In 2002, we also found that informal supervisory mechanisms and a limited  number of staff hampered Peace Corps efforts to ensure even application  of supervision and oversight. The agency had some formal mechanisms for  documenting and assessing post practices, including the annual evaluation  and testing of post emergency action plans and regional safety and  security officer reports on post practices. Nonetheless, regional directors  and country directors relied primarily on informal supervisory  mechanisms, such as staff meetings, conversations with volunteers, and  e-mail to ensure that staff were doing an adequate job of implementing the  safety and security framework. One country director observed that it was  difficult to oversee program managers\u2019 site development or monitoring  activities because the post did not have a formal system for performing  these tasks. We also reported that Peace Corps\u2019 capacity to monitor and  provide feedback to posts on their safety and security performance was  limited by the small number of staff available to perform relevant tasks.  We noted that the agency had hired three field-based safety and security  specialists to examine and help improve post practices, and that the  Inspector General also played an important role in helping posts  implement the agency\u2019s safety and security framework. However, we  reported that between October 2000 and May 2002 the safety and security  specialists had been able to provide input to only about one-third of Peace  Corps\u2019 posts while the Inspector General had issued findings on safety and  security practices at only 12 posts over 2 years.
