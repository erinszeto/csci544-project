GAO's analysis of U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC) data\u2014an agency within the judiciary\u2014showed that information on restitution orders was available for 95 percent of all offenders sentenced from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. Specifically, 214,578 federal offenders were sentenced during this time period and restitution was ordered for 33,158, or 15 percent, of those offenders. Collectively, courts ordered these offenders to pay $33.9 billion in restitution. Most federal offenders sentenced during these years were sentenced for immigration or drug-related offenses. In interviews, USAO officials stated that these offenses do not typically have victims requiring restitution. GAO found that data on reasons why restitution was not ordered were incomplete for 5 percent of all offenders sentenced from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. Determining why data on restitution orders are incomplete may inform the judiciary of the cause of the incomplete data and any efforts needed to improve USSC data.", "GAO's analysis of Department of Justice (DOJ) data showed that USAOs collected $2.95 billion in restitution debt in fiscal years 2014 through 2016, see figure below. However, at the end of fiscal year 2016, $110 billion in previously ordered restitution remained outstanding, and USAOs identified $100 billion of that outstanding debt as uncollectible due to offenders' inability to pay.", "DOJ identified improving debt collection\u2014including restitution\u2014as a major management initiative in its 2014-2018 Strategic Plan.

One of the  goals of federal criminal restitution is to restore victims of federal crimes  to the position they occupied before the crime was committed. Various  entities within the federal government are involved in the process of  requesting, ordering, and collecting restitution for crime victims, including  the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the judiciary. Prosecutors within  DOJ have the burden of proving a victim\u2019s losses in court; victims are  those who suffered a physical injury or financial loss as a direct and  proximate result of the offense. When restitution is ordered by the court,  it is to be in the full amount of each victim\u2019s losses without consideration  of the economic circumstances of the defendant. Once restitution is  ordered by the court, DOJ is responsible for collecting restitution  payments and has delegated these activities to Financial Litigation Units  (FLU) within each U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office (USAO). FLUs are also to  coordinate with federal probation officers supervising offenders to ensure  offenders pay restitution ordered.", "The collection of federal criminal restitution has been a longstanding  challenge. We reported in 2001 that the amount of uncollected criminal  debt\u2014of which restitution is a component\u2014had more than doubled from  September 30, 1995 to September 30, 1999. Specifically, we found that  DOJ had not collected most of the outstanding criminal debt due to,  among other factors, the nature of the debt, and a lack of coordination  between relevant DOJ components. To address these findings, we made  24 recommendations, including 14 to DOJ, among other agencies. DOJ  implemented 11 of our recommendations, including that DOJ develop  performance measures for criminal debt collection and better coordinate  internally and with federal courts. In 2005, we reported that although DOJ  had taken some steps to address our recommendations, prospects for  collecting restitution for victims were poor and court-ordered restitution far  exceeded amounts likely to be repaid in selected cases we reviewed.  We found that, among other reasons, this situation occurred because  there were minimal negative consequences when offenders did not pay  restitution as ordered by the courts.", "More recently in 2015, the DOJ Inspector General recommended DOJ  improve its prioritization of debt collection as well as collaboration among  DOJ component offices to better use forfeited assets to pay restitution  debt. DOJ took action to address the Inspector General\u2019s  recommendations by reviewing the system it uses to prioritize debt  collection actions, by incorporating discussion of asset recovery into its  training program, and by initiating a comprehensive study to review  existing protocols and structures to improve DOJ\u2019s ability to collect debts  owed to crime victims.", "The Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016 contained a provision for  us to review and assess the federal criminal restitution process for fiscal  years 2014 through 2016. This report addresses the following four  questions:  1.  To what extent is information available on restitution requested by  DOJ and ordered by courts for eligible federal criminal cases for fiscal  years 2014 through 2016?  2.  How much restitution debt did DOJ collect for fiscal years 2014  through 2016 and how much restitution remains outstanding?  3.  To what extent are DOJ\u2019s recommended practices for restitution  considered effective?  4.  To what extent has DOJ conducted oversight on the collection of  restitution?", "To answer all four questions, we analyzed relevant laws, including the  Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 (MVRA) and the Justice for All  Reauthorization Act of 2016. We also reviewed agency documentation  and spoke with officials from DOJ components and the judiciary. Within  DOJ, these included officials from the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys  (EOUSA), the Criminal Division, the Money Laundering and Asset  Recovery Section within the Criminal Division and the Justice  Management Division. Within the judiciary, these included officials from  the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC), the Judicial  Conference, the U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC), and Probation  and Pretrial Services within AOUSC.", "We further selected six federal judicial districts throughout the country  and conducted semi-structured interviews with USAO officials and federal  probation officers within those districts to obtain their views on the  restitution process. Because the collection of restitution has been a  longstanding challenge, we selected districts to study based on the extent  of the USAO\u2019s collection of restitution within that district. Specifically, we  selected USAOs for three districts that had relatively high levels of  restitution collected and USAOs for three districts that had relatively low  levels of restitution collected from fiscal years 2014 through 2015\u2014the last 2 years of data available when we began our review. In particular, we  spoke with USAO and probation officials within the District of Connecticut,  the Southern District of California, the District of New Jersey, the  Southern District of Ohio, the District of South Dakota and the District of  Wyoming. Additionally, we ensured that our selected districts reflected  geographical diversity to capture a range of perspectives and  experiences. Since we selected a non-probability sample of districts, the  information we obtained cannot be generalized more broadly to all  districts. However, the information provides important context and insights  into how the restitution process works across the country.

To determine the extent of information  available on restitution requested by DOJ, we interviewed DOJ and  EOUSA officials as well as USAO officials in the six districts mentioned  above to determine how prosecutors are to document requests for  restitution. To determine the extent of information available for restitution  ordered by courts, we analyzed USSC data on restitution orders for fiscal  years 2014 through 2016. We assessed the reliability of these data by  reviewing system documentation and interviewing knowledgeable officials  about system controls. We determined that these data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives. We also analyzed the  extent to which these data contained required information about the  reasons restitution was not ordered and then compared the results of our  analysis against Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government.", "To address the second question on the amount of restitution debt DOJ  collected for fiscal years 2014 through 2016 and the amount outstanding, we analyzed data from DOJ\u2019s debt management system (the  Consolidated Debt Collection System) from fiscal years 2014 through  2016. We assessed the reliability of these data by reviewing system  documentation, interviewing knowledgeable officials about system  controls, and conducting electronic testing. We determined that these  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives.  We used these data to determine the amount of restitution collected by  each USAO during fiscal years 2014 through 2016 as well as the amount  of debt outstanding during this time. Further, during our interviews with  DOJ and judiciary officials as well as USAO and probation officials in the  six districts mentioned above, we obtained perspectives on potential  factors contributing to outstanding debt.", "To address the third question on the extent to which DOJ\u2019s recommended  practices for restitution are considered effective, we reviewed agency  documentation, including guidance manuals for USAO prosecutors and  financial litigation unit staff. We interviewed EOUSA officials responsible  for developing this guidance and USAO officials in the six districts to  determine the extent to which they find this guidance helpful for  requesting, facilitating orders for, and collecting restitution.", "To address the fourth question on the extent to which DOJ has conducted  oversight on the collection of restitution, we reviewed our prior work and  reports by the DOJ Office of the Inspector General to identify prior  recommendations made to DOJ and interviewed EOUSA officials to  assess the extent to which these recommendations have been  implemented. We also analyzed DOJ\u2019s 2014-2018 Strategic Plan and  EOUSA\u2019s internal evaluation program to assess the extent to which  DOJ\u2019s oversight mechanisms provide sufficient information on USAOs\u2019  performance in meeting initiatives outlined in DOJ\u2019s Strategic Plan and  the Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016. We compared the results  of our analysis to the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993  (GPRA), as updated by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010  (GPRAMA).

Probation officers may obtain this  information from DOJ, which has the statutory responsibility for the  enforcement and collection of criminal debt. The court uses the PSR,  among other things, to determine whether to order restitution. If an  offender is released to the community by the court and placed on  supervision, probation officers are responsible for ensuring the offender  abides by the terms of release, including paying any restitution owed to  victims.

To facilitate this, a Victim-Witness coordinator  within the USAO responsible for the case provides victims the opportunity  to explain their losses in detail, usually through a Victim Impact  Statement. This information is then to be provided to a federal probation  officer who uses it to begin a PSR.", "To develop the PSR, probation officers use information provided by the  USAO and may contact victims and verify the loss amounts.

FLUs classify debts from a  Priority Code 1 debt (indicating that FLUs will make collection of this debt  the highest priority) to a Priority Code 4 debt (indicating that FLUs will  make collection of this debt the lowest priority).

Federal regulations provide that the proceeds from  forfeited assets are first used to cover program costs associated with  forfeiture-related activities and next to pay valid owners, lien-holders, and  federal financial regulatory agencies. Forfeited assets can then be  distributed to other victims of crime as compensation for their losses if  their loss is a direct result of the commission of the offense underlying  forfeiture or a related offense. Any remaining funds from the forfeited  asset may be placed into official use, distributed to foreign governments,  state or local law enforcement agencies as part of the equitable sharing  program to enhance cooperation with federal investigations.", "When victims are eligible for compensation using forfeited assets, DOJ  employs two processes: restoration and remission. The restoration  process involves the USAO staff requesting funds on behalf of a victim  when there is both an order of forfeiture and an order of restitution. Under  the restoration process, USAO staff request DOJ\u2019s Money Laundering  and Asset Recovery Section to use the forfeited asset to pay a restitution  debt. If DOJ approves the request for restoration, the funds from the  forfeited property are then transferred to the Clerk of the Court who  disburses this money to the victim. The remission process requires a  victim of a crime to directly petition DOJ to receive funds from the  forfeited property. According to officials in DOJ\u2019s Criminal Division, the  courts may not order restitution on behalf of victims who suffered a  specific actual loss as a direct result of a crime for a variety of reasons,  and therefore the remission process serves as a complement to the  restoration process to ensure victims are made whole. For example,  these officials stated that, among other reasons, the courts may not order  restitution if a defendant dies prior to sentencing or if the case is one in  which a court is not required to, and does not, order restitution, but the  victim has suffered eligible losses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Select USAOs Reported Documenting Requests for Restitution, but the Judiciary Did Not Always Document Reasons It Was Not Ordered EOUSA and Officials in Six USAOs Told Us Their Offices Document Requests for Restitution in Case Files", "paragraphs": ["EOUSA and USAO officials in all six of the offices with whom we spoke  told us that prosecutors document requests for restitution in their case  files and that their offices employ other internal controls, such as the use  of templates and forms, throughout the prosecution process to ensure  that prosecutors request restitution as appropriate.

Across all restitution debts, DOJ  collected at least some of the debt for one-third of debts and did not  collect any restitution on the remaining two-thirds.", "More than 60 percent of the restitution DOJ collected in fiscal years 2014  through 2016 was owed to non-federal victims ($1.8 billion), including  individuals, corporations and state and local governments. An additional  37 percent of restitution was collected on behalf of federal agencies that  were victims of crimes. One percent of restitution collected was  community restitution, which is restitution collected for drug offenses that  otherwise have no victims and which is disbursed to state victim  assistance agencies and state agencies dedicated to the reduction of  substance abuse, as shown in table 4.", "AOUSC officials noted that some collected restitution is not disbursed to  non-federal victims due to a lack of accurate contact information for these  victims. Specifically, according to AOUSC, as of June 2017, courts had  more than $132 million in restitution due to 113,260 victims that could not  be disbursed because of a lack of accurate contact information for these  victims. DOJ is required to provide courts with victim contact  information, and victims are to notify DOJ if their contact information  changes. However, AOUSC and USAO officials told us that this  notification by victims may not always occur. For example, officials in one  USAO told us that due to the length of court proceedings, victims may  move without notifying the court prior to the disbursement of restitution  and, as a result, the court is unable to disburse restitution to those  victims."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Of $110 Billion in Outstanding Debt, 91 Percent Is Uncollectible Because Offenders Have Little Ability to Pay", "paragraphs": ["According to our analysis of DOJ data, at the end of fiscal year 2016,  $110 billion in restitution was outstanding and USAOs had identified $100  billion of that debt as uncollectible, as shown in figure 2.

For example, according to USSC data, 95 percent of  offenders ordered to pay restitution from fiscal years 2014 through 2016  received a waiver from paying a court-ordered fine, indicating their  inability to pay. While courts are allowed to take an offender\u2019s economic  circumstances into consideration when issuing fines, they generally may  not do so when ordering restitution. As a result, EOUSA and federal  probation officials with whom we spoke stated that offenders ordered to  pay restitution often do not have an ability to do so and therefore a large  amount of restitution orders is uncollectible."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Select USAO Officials View DOJ\u2019s Recommended Practices for Requesting, Ordering and Collecting Restitution as Generally Effective", "paragraphs": ["Through various guidance documents, DOJ has identified and  recommended numerous practices for DOJ prosecutors and FLU staff to  use throughout the restitution process to help ensure full and timely  restitution for victims. USAO officials in all six offices with whom we spoke  stated that, based on their experience, these practices were generally  effective. Specifically, DOJ and EOUSA officials identified practices for  prosecutors and FLU staff to use when requesting restitution, facilitating  court orders for restitution, and collecting restitution and documented  these practices in several guidance manuals. Officials we interviewed  from all six USAOs stated they were generally satisfied with the guidance  from EOUSA and that they thought most of DOJ\u2019s recommended  practices were effective when requesting restitution, facilitating court  orders for restitution, and collecting restitution.", "Requesting restitution. Officials we interviewed from three USAOs  identified coordination between prosecutors and case investigators prior  to sentencing to identify victims and their losses as an important practice  for requesting restitution. USAO officials from three of the six offices  stated that gathering detailed information on an offender\u2019s financial  resources, which include assets that could be forfeited and used to pay a  restitution debt, was a very effective practice related to requesting  restitution.", "Facilitating court orders of restitution. Although the courts, and not  prosecutors, are responsible for ordering restitution, DOJ guidance  identifies several practices that prosecutors can use to facilitate orders of  restitution that may increase the likelihood of full and timely restitution for  victims. Officials from three of six USAOs stated that the most effective  practice related to ordering restitution was ensuring courts ordered  restitution as due and payable immediately. Specifically, when offenders  cannot pay restitution in an immediate lump-sum payment, the courts  must specify a payment schedule through which the offender will pay  restitution based on the offender\u2019s ability to pay. In these cases, USAO  officials stated that it is effective for prosecutors to ensure the restitution  order specifies that restitution is due and payable immediately. According  to an EOUSA official, this permits the agency to immediately pursue all  collection remedies allowed by law whenever the debtor has or  subsequently obtains the ability to pay.", "Collecting restitution. Officials from all six USAOs stated that using the  Treasury Offset Program (TOP), a program that allows for the reduction  or withholding of a debtor\u2019s federal benefits, such as a tax refund, was  one of the most effective practices for collecting restitution. Specifically,  officials in one USAO told us that TOP requires minimal effort for FLU  staff and can result in a high amount of collections. As an example,  officials from two USAOs told us their respective offices each recovered  more than $500,000 dollars in restitution debt in fiscal year 2016 through  TOP. Officials from three of the six offices also identified using wage  garnishment as an effective practice for collecting restitution.", "Across all parts of the restitution process, USAO officials we spoke with  also consistently identified DOJ recommended practices related to  internal and external communication and collaboration as effective for  improving the restitution process. Specifically, the officials identified  collaboration between various units in the USAO as an effective practice  to ensuring restitution for victims. For example, USAO officials in two of  the six offices highlighted coordination between Victim-Witness  coordinators and prosecutors to help identify victims and quantify their  losses as effective to assisting in the request for restitution. Additionally,  USAO officials in all six offices stated that strong coordination between  FLU personnel and criminal prosecutors to identify an offender\u2019s financial  resources and available assets was an effective practice to help ensure  FLU staff could collect restitution using those resources or assets.", "USAO officials from five of six offices identified external communication  between FLU and the federal probation office as an effective practice.  Specifically, officials from these USAOs stated that FLUs coordinating  with probation officers during the offender\u2019s supervision period to enforce  restitution terms was an effective practice for collecting restitution.  Additionally, according to EOUSA guidance, FLU staff can use outreach  and training with other partners such as the probation office to facilitate  information sharing on restitution collection issues and officials from five  of six USAOs told us that FLUs conducting training and outreach is a very  effective practice.", "In addition, probation officials we interviewed in each of the six federal  judicial districts we selected stated that ongoing communication between  USAO staff and probation officers is effective to ensuring victims are  identified and receive full and timely restitution. Probation officials from  one court district emphasized the importance of a good working  relationship with the USAO, stating that the probation office and USAO  are better able to ensure victims and their losses are accurately identified and defendants\u2019 ability to pay is adequately addressed when working  collaboratively. A probation official from another office said that probation  officers regularly coordinated with the USAO\u2019s FLU, and this coordination  was particularly important on cases involving complex financial crimes,  where the offender has a complicated financial portfolio. Further,  probation officials from five of six probation offices also stated that  attending training conducted by the FLU is a very effective practice.", "EOUSA and selected USAO officials told us that while these practices  may be useful in some circumstances, they may not be effective or  applicable in all cases or in all districts. Specifically, practices DOJ  recommends may be effective when offenders have the ability to pay  restitution but are simply unwilling to do so; however, USAO officials in  five of six offices stated that these practices cannot mitigate the fact that  many offenders lack the ability to pay restitution because they lack assets  and income. Additionally, while EOUSA guidance recommends that FLU  staff contact co-defendants or victims for information on the whereabouts  or assets of offenders who owe restitution, officials from three USAOs told  us this was not effective. According to one official, although co- defendants are sometimes eager to share information, the information is  usually unreliable. USAO officials also identified some recommended  practices as not applicable to their district. For example, EOUSA  recommends that FLU units request Asset Investigation assistance from  EOUSA for complex cases involving large amounts of valuable assets.  However, USAO officials in a small, rural district with whom we spoke  stated that the types of cases their office prosecutes tend not to be the  type of financial cases that warranted use of this resource."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOJ Could Improve Oversight of the Collection of Federal Restitution, Including the Use of Forfeited Assets to Pay Restitution Debt DOJ Does Not Have Measures or Goals to Assess Performance in the Collection of Restitution", "paragraphs": ["DOJ has identified improving debt collection\u2014including court-ordered  restitution\u2014as a major management initiative in its 2014-2018 Strategic  Plan. However, it does not have any measures or goals in place to  assess its performance in meeting this initiative or meet requirements that  it evaluate its performance in seeking and recovering restitution as  required by statute. In 2001, we recommended that DOJ adequately  measure its criminal debt collection performance against established  goals to help improve collections and stem the growth in uncollected  criminal debt. DOJ concurred with this recommendation, and as of fiscal  year 2003, annually assessed each district based on established  collection goals for that district. However, as of September 2017, DOJ  no longer evaluates each district based on established goals. EOUSA  officials stated that DOJ no longer uses these performance goals and that  the agency did not maintain records for when or why it stopped.", "EOUSA officials stated that while the agency does not have any  measures or goals to assess USAOs\u2019 performance in improving debt  collection, including the collection of federal restitution, they are working  with DOJ\u2019s Justice Management Division to develop a suite of analytical  tools to monitor the collection of debt across all offices. According to DOJ,  some of these analytical tools have been implemented and additional  tools will be implemented by March 2018. EOUSA officials stated that  these tools will help the agency determine which cases are most likely to  result in significant collections and the types and timing of enforcement  actions that generate maximum debt recovery results. EOUSA officials  further stated the analytical tools will allow the agency to compare  districts\u2019 efforts based on a variety of factors (e.g., caseload, staff size,  and enforcement actions). These analytical tools may provide EOUSA  with valuable insight into the present condition of the collection of  restitution across USAOs, but they will not provide DOJ with a baseline  performance standard that could be used to indicate if USAOs\u2019 efforts to  collect restitution debts are having a measurable impact in meeting DOJ\u2019s  objective of improving debt collection.", "Additionally, EOUSA conducts evaluations of each USAO every 4 years,  which include a review of FLU operations, but EOUSA officials stated that  these reviews do not include oversight of the collection of restitution.  Among other aspects of USAO operations, these internal evaluations  review the extent to which each FLU is complying with statutory and DOJ  requirements related to debt collection, has sufficient program resources,  and adequately manages its caseload. However, DOJ and EOUSA  officials told us that it did not plan to use these internal evaluations to  meet the Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016 requirement to  evaluate each USAO on its performance in seeking and recovering  restitution for victims. Specifically, the officials stated that these internal  evaluations are not an appropriate mechanism to meet the law\u2019s  requirements because the internal evaluations do not specifically review  the seeking and recovery of restitution for victims. According to DOJ  officials responsible for the internal evaluation program, these evaluations  are largely intended to provide onsite management assistance and  analysis of how the USAO allocates its administrative and legal personnel  resources rather than the office\u2019s efficacy in collecting restitution.", "Consistent with requirements outlined in the Government Performance  and Results Act Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA), performance  measurement is the ongoing monitoring and reporting of program  accomplishments\u2014particularly towards pre-established, objective and  quantifiable goals\u2014and agencies are to establish performance measures  to assess progress towards those goals. While GPRAMA is applicable  to the department or agency level, performance measures and goals are  important management tools at all levels of an agency, including the  program, project, or activity level. Agencies can use performance  measurement to make various types of management decisions to  improve programs and results, such as developing strategies and  allocating resources, including identifying problems and taking corrective  action when appropriate. Further, the Justice for All Reauthorization Act  of 2016 requires DOJ to evaluate each USAO in its performance in  recovering restitution for victims.", "DOJ and EOUSA officials told us that DOJ does not require USAOs to  establish performance measures or goals to assess their progress in  improving the collection of restitution. DOJ and EOUSA officials also told  us that each USAO could develop performance goals but that they were  unaware of the extent to which USAOs did so, and further, they do not  track the extent to which USAOs met performance goals. Additionally,  these officials stated that because each USAO faces different constraints  in its ability to collect restitution, establishing a uniform and consistent  performance measure and goal would be challenging. EOUSA officials  noted that some USAOs may have more resources, such as more FLU  staff or specialized asset investigators, available to pursue collections as  compared to other offices and therefore offices with fewer resources  could have difficulty meeting a performance goal. Further, EOUSA and  USAO officials stated that the extent to which DOJ can collect on a debt  is heavily influenced by factors outside of the agency\u2019s control, such as  an offender\u2019s ability to pay.", "USAOs could use information provided by performance measures and  goals\u2014such as an office\u2019s ability to meet a performance goal\u2014to make  managerial decisions to help address these constraints, such as by  increasing the allocation of staff resources. Further, to avoid comparing  USAOs to a nationally set performance goal that does not account for  specific constraints faced by each office, DOJ could\u2014as it did in fiscal  year 2003\u2014require each USAO to establish its own objective,  quantitative collection goals based on historical, district-specific collection  statistics. Finally, as previously discussed, each USAO already accounts  for external factors that affect the collectability of a debt, such as an  offender\u2019s ability to pay, by suspending collection action on debts it  identifies as uncollectible. Therefore, any performance measures and  goals developed could be based solely on debts that the USAO already  has determined to be collectible.", "Stakeholders we interviewed\u2014including officials from one USAO,  probation officials in two districts, and officials with DOJ\u2019s Office of Crime  Victims\u2014noted that receiving restitution is both emotionally and  financially important to victims. Specifically, officials from one USAO and  one probation office noted that while many victims may never receive the  full amount of restitution ordered, receiving even a minimal amount of  restitution is a symbolic victory and that it is important for victims to know  the government is making efforts to collect restitution on their behalf. The  legislative history of the MVRA echoes these sentiments, providing that  even nominal restitution payments have benefits for the victim of crime,  and that orders of restitution are largely worthless without enforcement.  Yet, according to our analysis, $10 billion of restitution debt DOJ identified  as collectible remained outstanding at the end of fiscal year 2016.  Further, the extent to which USAOs collected restitution varied widely\u2014 from a high of one USAO district collecting nearly 350 percent of all  collectible debt in fiscal years 2014 through 2016 to a low of one district  collecting less than one percent of collectible debt in the same period.", "Without performance measures, including the establishment of goals,  DOJ cannot assess if this variation is due to factors outside the control of  USAOs or due to management deficiencies that require corrective action.", "Developing performance measures and goals for each USAO related to  the collection of restitution would allow DOJ to assess its progress in  achieving its major management initiative in improving debt collection\u2014 including debts owed to victims as court-ordered restitution.

Further, DOJ regulations and policy  require that eligible victims receive compensation from forfeited assets  before certain other uses, such as official use or equitable sharing.  However, while DOJ tracks the amount of compensation provided to  victims through forfeited assets, it does not have assurances that forfeited  assets are being used to compensate victims to the greatest extent  possible.", "According to DOJ information, the agency made payments of about $595  million to eligible victims other than owners of the property from the  Assets Forfeiture Fund from fiscal years 2014 through 2016, or 15  percent of $3.9 billion in paid expenditures during this period, as shown in  table 5.", "As table 5 shows, DOJ can account for cases in which forfeited assets  were used to compensate eligible victims who were not owners or  lienholders. However, DOJ does not have information on the overall  universe of victims who could have been eligible to receive compensation  from forfeited assets. Further, it does not have insight into any reasons  why funds from forfeited assets were not used for these victims.  Specifically, DOJ officials stated that the department collects information  on whether victims have been identified in cases associated with forfeited  assets, and if restitution is anticipated in these cases, but it does not track  the extent to which these victims were ultimately compensated using  forfeited assets. Further, DOJ also does not collect information on  reasons why victims were not compensated using funds from forfeited  assets. While DOJ is required to use forfeited assets to compensate  victims before using those assets for certain other purposes, the agency  is unable to provide assurances that it is always doing so because it does  not have information on the overall universe of victims or reasons why  victims were not compensated using forfeited assets. As a result, DOJ  does not have a basis to know whether the $595 million provided to  victims from fiscal years 2014 through 2016 is the maximum amount of  compensation the agency could have provided to victims using forfeited  assets.", "Full use of forfeited assets for victim compensation has long been, and  continues to be, a goal of DOJ. In 2005, an interagency task force\u2014led  by DOJ and including the Department of Treasury, Office of Management  and Budget and AOUSC\u2014developed a strategic plan to improve the  collection of criminal debt. Among other goals included in its strategic  plan, the task force stated a goal of examining how asset seizure and  forfeiture procedures can be used to maximize recoveries for victims.  More recently, DOJ reported in its 2014-2018 Strategic Plan that it would  make every effort to recover full and fair restitution for victims using the  federal forfeiture statutes to preserve and recover criminal proceeds.  Specifically, DOJ stated that using federal forfeiture statutes to recover  full and fair restitution for victims is one part of its strategy to protect the  rights of the American people and enforce the rule of law. Finally, DOJ  officials told us they considered providing compensation to victims as one  goal of the Asset Forfeiture Program and EOUSA stated in guidance that  asset forfeiture is the most widely available and effective tool to seize  assets for restitution purposes. Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government call on federal managers to design control activities  to achieve the agency\u2019s objectives. These controls can include using  quality information to make informed decisions, evaluate the entity\u2019s  performance in achieving key objectives, and address risks.", "DOJ officials told us that they do not track the extent to which victims  were not compensated using forfeited assets because USAO staff are not  required to request that these assets be used for victim compensation.  DOJ officials explained that staff are required to indicate in the agency\u2019s  forfeited asset database, the Consolidated Asset Tracking System, if  victims exist in cases associated with forfeited assets and if restitution is  anticipated in these cases. However, these officials stated that staff are  not required to then compensate these victims using the forfeited assets  or to indicate why these assets were not used for this purpose. DOJ  officials told us that decisions to compensate victims using forfeited  assets are best left to the judgment of the USAO staff familiar with the  case, such as the prosecuting attorney or asset forfeiture staff.", "DOJ officials pointed to informal communication and coordination among  prosecutors, the FLU, and the Asset Forfeiture unit in each USAO as a  means to provide compensation to victims as appropriate. However,  communication and coordination among these groups has been a  challenge for USAOs, as the DOJ Inspector General found in a June  2015 review of DOJ\u2019s debt collection program. Similarly, during our  current review, EOUSA and USAO officials we spoke with identified  communication and coordination as an area for improvement. EOUSA  officials told us that while they thought that FLU staff and Asset Forfeiture  unit staff were collaborating more frequently to use forfeited assets to  collect restitution debts since the issuance of the DOJ Inspector General\u2019s  report, the extent of collaboration between these two units still varied  across USAOs. Further, officials we talked to in two USAOs and one  probation office noted that USAO staff could improve their use of forfeited  assets for restitution payments. For example, officials in one probation  office noted that it was their practice to identify forfeited assets that could  be used for compensation in the PSR because they had observed that  USAO staff were frequently not applying such assets to victim  compensation.", "While DOJ may allow USAO staff to use discretion when requesting  restoration or alerting victims to assets available for compensation,  increasing the agency\u2019s understanding of the extent to which assets could  have been\u2014but were not\u2014used for victim compensation, and the  reasons for those decisions, does not affect that discretion. There are  legitimate reasons why victims might not be compensated using forfeited  assets; for example, the assets may have other owners or lienholders that  must be compensated prior to victims, or offenders may have other  means by which to pay victims restitution. However, there are also  instances where victims may have not received compensation through  forfeited assets as a result of unintentional circumstances. For example,  according to DOJ\u2019s Asset Forfeiture Manual, forfeiture actions can  proceed faster than the parallel criminal case. Consequently, assets  might be equitably shared, placed into official use, or remitted to victims  who file petitions long before restitution is ordered, and therefore would  not be available for other victims who wait for restitution to be ordered  after an offender is sentenced. To avoid this outcome, DOJ recommends  that USAOs coordinate to ensure the retention of property for victim  compensation. However, although DOJ officials responsible for leading  DOJ\u2019s asset forfeiture efforts highlighted the need for expedient  coordination when USAO staff are considering using forfeited assets to  compensate victims, they stated this may not always occur. As a result,  otherwise eligible victims may not always be compensated through  forfeited assets.", "By gathering information about the extent to which assets were used for  victim compensation\u2014including when they were not used and reasons  why not\u2014DOJ could have a better understanding of potential instances  where victims could be, but are not, receiving compensation through  forfeited funds and could take steps to address them accordingly. Options  for gathering such information could include doing a one-time  retrospective study of forfeited assets with victims or anticipated  restitution to determine the extent that assets were used for victim  compensation, or creating a tracking mechanism through its forfeited  assets database, or another system.", "Gathering information on the extent to which forfeited assets were used  for victim compensation, including when not used and reasons why not,  could position DOJ to take action to increase the use of these assets for  victim compensation if warranted. These actions could include providing  funds for increased asset forfeiture staff in USAOs, providing additional  training or changing policies or procedures for using forfeited assets to  compensate victims. Fully and systematically understanding the extent to  which issues, such as a lack of coordination within USAOs, result in  victims not being compensated using forfeited assets would give DOJ a  basis upon which to develop improvements to the Asset Forfeiture  Program. Such information would also provide DOJ and staff at all  USAOs with information to evaluate its performance in achieving one of  the goals of the Asset Forfeiture Program and taking action to meet the  agency goal of protecting the rights of the American people\u2014including  the right to full and fair restitution for victims."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Restitution serves the criminal justice goal of holding offenders  accountable and, to the extent possible, restoring victims of federal  crimes to their prior position had the crime not occurred.

However,  the fact that restitution is difficult to collect does not negate the important  responsibilities of the judiciary and DOJ to properly manage and oversee  all aspects of the restitution process.", "By law, courts are to state why they did not order restitution and provide  that information to USSC. While this information was collected and  recorded in USSC data for most offenders, we found that this information  was missing for thousands of offenders. It is important for the judiciary to  ensure that this information is consistently collected and recorded to  assist USSC in its continuous re-examination of its guidelines and policy  statements and ensure that various sentencing practices are achieving  their stated purposes. The judiciary could support USSC in this endeavor  by determining why this information is missing. Results from this study  could help inform the judiciary whether this issue rises to the level of an  internal control deficiency and whether additional action can be taken to  improve the transparency of sentencing decisions.", "While DOJ has delegated collection activities for restitution to USAOs, it  could provide better oversight to ensure it is making reasonable efforts to  collect restitution and meeting its responsibility to victims. USAOs have  identified a significant portion of outstanding restitution debt as  uncollectible, but they have also identified $10 billion of outstanding  restitution debt that could be collected. Developing and implementing  performance measures and goals for each USAO would allow DOJ to  gauge USAOs\u2019 success in collecting this restitution and, by extension, the  department\u2019s success in achieving its major management initiative to  increase the collection of debt. Further, DOJ could use performance  information to improve the practices of offices in seeking and recovering  restitution, consistent with a requirement in the Justice for All  Reauthorization Act of 2016.", "Finally, DOJ could gain greater visibility into the use of forfeited assets to  compensate victims by gathering information on cases in which victims  have been identified and restitution is anticipated but forfeited assets are  not used, and any reasons why.
