This report examines (1) the extent to which data on collections of fees, fines, and penalties are publically available and useful for the purpose of congressional oversight; and (2) the benefits and challenges to government-wide reporting of fees, fines, and penalties. GAO assessed government-wide fee, fine, and penalty data against criteria for availability and usefulness based on multiple sources, including prior GAO work and input from staff of selected congressional committees. GAO interviewed OMB staff, Treasury officials, and representatives of organizations with expertise in federal budget issues and reviewed prior GAO work to identify benefits and challenges of reporting these data."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["There are no comprehensive, government-wide data at the level of detail that identifies specific fees, fines, or penalties. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) report data that include these collections at the budget account level, which generally covers a set of agency activities or programs. OMB and Treasury also report some summary data for budgeting and financial management purposes. In the Budget of the U.S. Government , for example, OMB data showed government-wide fees totaled just over $335 billion in fiscal year 2017. These reports, however, are not designed to inventory or analyze fee, fine, or penalty collections and have significant limitations for that purpose.", "Although OMB collects more disaggregated data on fees, fines, and penalties, it does not make the data publicly available. OMB uses the disaggregated data in its OMB MAX database\u2014such as the agency and account\u2014to compile reported totals, such as the government-wide fees total in the Budget of the U.S. Government . Until OMB makes more disaggregated data publicly available, Congress has limited information on collections by agency to inform oversight and decision-making.", "OMB's government-wide total of fees includes collections that are not fees and excludes some fee collections. The total includes all collections for accounts in which fees make up at least half of the account's collections and excludes all others. OMB does not direct agencies to regularly review and update the accounts included in the total. Therefore, if accounts' makeups change such that fee collections drop below, or rise above, the 50 percent threshold, accounts may have incorrect fee designations and the total may be inaccurate.", "Further, OMB does not disclose the limitation that the total may exclude some fees and include other collections that are not fees. As a result, some users of the data are likely unaware of the potential for the total fees to be overestimated or underestimated.", "Further, no source of government-wide data consistently reports data elements on fees, fines, and penalties that could help inform congressional oversight. Generally, congressional staff told us that additional data, such as amounts of specific penalties, would increase transparency and facilitate oversight. These data could help Congress identify trends in collections and significant changes that could be an indication of an agency's performance. While reporting government-wide fee, fine, and penalty data provides benefits, there are trade-offs in terms of the time and federal resources it would take to develop and implement a process for agencies to report these data. The level of federal investment would vary depending on factors, such as the number of data elements included and the level of detail reported. Developing a comprehensive and accessible data source would provide greater benefits, but would likely be resource intensive. Alternatively, incorporating a small number of data elements that Congress identifies as most useful for oversight into ongoing government-wide reporting efforts could incrementally improve transparency and information for oversight and decision-making, with fewer resources."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations to enhance OMB reporting on fees, fines, and penalties, including making disaggregated data publically available, updating instructions to federal agencies to review accounts designated as containing fees, and disclosing limitations in data reported.

Fees are an approach to financing federal  programs or activities that, in general, are related to some voluntary  transaction or request for government services above and beyond  what is normally available to the public. By requiring identifiable  beneficiaries to pay all or part of the cost of a good or service, fees  can promote both equity and economic efficiency.  Regularly  reviewing fees help ensure that agencies, Congress, and  stakeholders have complete information.", "Fines and penalties: Criminal fines and penalty payments are  imposed by courts as punishment for criminal violations. Civil  monetary penalties are not a result of criminal proceedings but are  employed by courts and federal agencies to enforce federal laws and  regulations. For example, civil monetary penalty payments are  collected from financial institutions by certain financial regulators,  such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, from enforcement  actions assessed against financial institutions for violations related to  anti-money laundering requirements. Reviews and, as needed,  adjustments to fines and penalties could help ensure they provide a  meaningful incentive for compliance.", "The design and structure of statutory authorities for fees, fines, and  penalties can vary widely. In prior work, we have identified key design  decisions related to how fee, fine, and penalty collections are used that  help Congress balance agency flexibility with congressional control and  oversight. Congress determines the availability of collections by defining  the extent to which an agency may obligate and expend them, including  the availability of the funds, the period of time the collections are available  for obligation, the purposes for which they may be obligated, and the  amount of the collections that are available to the agency. Fees, fines,  and penalties may be categorized as one of three types of collections  based on the structure of their statutory authority: offsetting collections,  offsetting receipts, or governmental receipts (see figure 1).", "Offsetting collections can provide agencies with more flexibility because  they are generally available for agency obligation without an additional  annual appropriation. In contrast, offsetting receipts and governmental  receipts involve greater congressional opportunities for control and oversight because, generally, additional congressional action is needed  before the collections are available for agency obligation. For example,  Congress must appropriate collections from offsetting receipts before  agencies are authorized to obligate these funds.", "The type of collection also determines how OMB and Treasury report the  collections. Offsetting collections and offsetting receipts result from  businesslike transactions and are recorded as offsets to spending.  Offsetting collections are authorized by law to be credited to appropriation  or fund expenditure accounts, while offsetting receipts are deposited in  receipt accounts.

Generally, all congressional staff we spoke with said  making additional government-wide data on fees, fines, and penalties,  such as those data elements described previously, without additional  outreach to agencies, would be useful and increase transparency. While  some congressional staff said such data elements are available through  direct outreach to agencies, other congressional staff told us they could  not always obtain the information they wanted. For example, staff from a  congressional committee said that one of the most critical data elements  for the purpose of congressional oversight is information on agency  reporting of obligations and expenditures because, in their view, currently  many agencies do not adequately report this information and some  agencies do not report this information at all. These data would provide  Congress a more complete picture of individual agencies\u2019 activities and  any potential overlap or duplication in multiple agencies\u2019 activities.  Congressional staff also said having government-wide data on collections  of fees could inform efforts that are crosscutting in nature. For example,  APHIS  and Customs and Border Protection jointly implement the AQI  program to help prevent the introduction of harmful agricultural pests and  diseases into the United States, and AQI fee collections are divided  between the two agencies.", "Publicly available data on government-wide collections of fines and  penalties could inform the public on agency enforcement activities and  compliance of regulated parties, such as those related to health or safety.  Some officials from external organizations and congressional staff said  that it would be useful to have government-wide data on individual fines  and penalties levied by agencies. For example, the Environmental  Protection Agency publishes an online database on its compliance and  enforcement actions, Enforcement and Compliance History Online  (ECHO). According to the website, the data available on ECHO allows  the public to monitor environmental compliance in communities,  corporations to monitor compliance across facilities they own, and  investors to more easily factor environmental performance into decisions.  Further, an official from an external organization with expertise in data  transparency stated that, ideally, a user would be able to link fine and  penalty data to spending data on USAspending.gov to increase  transparency in instances where an organization receiving a federal grant  or contract has also had a fine or penalty levied against it.", "Last, publicly available government-wide data on collections could inform  the public, specifically payers of fees, fines, and penalties, and facilitate  their participation in public comment opportunities. For example, OMB  staff said government-wide data could provide the public with clear,  transparent information across agencies on fee collections and allow the  public to analyze differences in fee programs among agencies. Payers of  fees may be able to make more informed comments on proposed  changes to a fee program if they had information on how it relates to  other fee programs across the federal government.", "Government-wide fee, fine, and penalty data would provide more  information to facilitate congressional oversight. These data could help  Congress identify trends in collections and significant changes that could  be an indication of an agency\u2019s performance. For example, staff of a  Congressional committee stated that fine and penalty data can be used to  examine enforcement actions on a particular issue or to identify potential  trends over time as an indicator of stronger or weaker enforcement  actions by an agency. Congress could also use these data to identify  variations in enforcement action among geographic regions or as an  indicator of the frequency of violations.", "Additionally, data on review and reporting requirements can inform  congressional oversight of fees, fines, and penalties. We previously  reported that regular comprehensive reviews of fees provide opportunities  for agencies and Congress to make improvements to a fee\u2019s design  which, if left unaddressed, could contribute to inefficient use of  government resources. For example, fee reviews could help ensure that  fees are properly set to cover the total costs of those activities which are  intended to be fully fee-funded. Fee reviews may also allow agencies and  Congress to identify where similar activities are funded differently; for  example, one by fees and one by appropriations. One such example is  the export control system, in which the State Department charges fees for  the export of items on the U.S. Munitions List, while the Commerce  Department does not charge fees for those items exported under its  jurisdiction.", "Government-wide reporting of fee, fine, and penalty data could also  inform Congress\u2019s funding decisions by providing a clearer picture of  agencies\u2019 total resources. Congressional staff stated that knowing the  statutory authority to collect and obligate funding from fees, fines, and  penalties\u2014along with any appropriation an agency may have received  from an annual appropriation act, which are currently available to  congressional staff\u2014would provide a more complete picture of an  agency\u2019s total annual funding, including the portion attributed to the  taxpayer and the portion attributed to payers of specific fees, fines, and  penalties. For example, staff from congressional committees we spoke  with said it would be useful to have data to show programs that receive  appropriations from both offsetting collections and appropriations not  derived from offsetting collections to inform decisions on how the program  is funded. Congressional staff also said this would provide more  opportunities to track the flow of money in and out of the government.  Overall funding decisions may be affected if an agency has an increase in  fee collections, for example. Congressional committee staff also said it  would be useful to have government-wide data on specific fees, fines,  and penalties that are offsetting collections because these collections are  available for obligation without going through the annual appropriations  process. Our prior work has shown that it is important to consider how the  agencies and entities with this authority facilitate oversight to ensure  effective management, transparency, and public accountability. Some  committee staff said they can request data directly from agencies when  they need more disaggregated information on fees, fines, and penalties,  and reported different levels of responsiveness from agencies. Publicly  available data could reduce potentially overlapping or duplicative requests  from staff to agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Challenges Exist for Standardizing Definitions of Fees, Fines, and Penalties", "paragraphs": ["According to officials from agencies and external organizations, there are  potential challenges to defining the government-wide data standard or  definition of fee, fine, and penalty programs by which agencies could  report. Because there is no statutory requirement for government-wide  reporting of fee, fine, and penalty data, agencies collect and use these  data for their own purposes, and are not using government-wide data  elements and standards that are consistent and comparable between  agencies. First, an agency may define a fee program as a single fee or a  set of related fees. For example, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration  Services charges more than 40 immigration and naturalization fees to  applicants and petitioners that could be grouped together as related fees  or split into up to 40 different fee programs. Second, officials from  external organizations said there are also challenges in defining data  standards the level of detail to report.  For example, an official from an  external organization said, for large financial penalties, it may be useful  for oversight for the data to identify each instance of the penalty, including  the fined party. However, that level of detail could raise privacy  sensitivities. For example, reporting every individual that paid an entrance  fee at a national park could present privacy concerns. Finally, for  elements that are useful for congressional oversight, one challenge could  be the timing of when funds are collected compared to when they are  available for obligation. The amount of funds collected in a year does not  necessarily equal the amount available to the agency that year. For  example, collections of Harbor Maintenance Fees are deposited to the  Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund and are not available for obligation  without appropriation. Funds collected in one year may not be necessarily  appropriated and obligated until a subsequent year.", "Our prior work on the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014  (DATA Act) implementation underscores the importance of standardized  and clearly defined data elements. We found inconsistent and potentially  confusing instructions from OMB regarding the Primary Place of  Performance data elements that resulted in inconsistent reporting among  agencies. The standard established by OMB and Treasury defines  Primary Place of Performance as \u201cwhere the predominant performance of  the award will be accomplished\u201d while other instructions define it as \u201cthe  location of the principal plant or place of business where the items will be  produced, supplied from stock, or where the service will be performed.\u201d  We found some agencies used the first definition and some used the  second. In one case, the Departments of Labor and Health and Human  Services issued contracts to the same company for similar office printers,  but one reported the primary place of performance as California, the  location of the office where the printers were delivered and used. The  other agency reported the primary place of performance as New Jersey,  the location of the company that supplied the printers. As a result, the  data were not comparable between agencies or across the federal  government, limiting the usefulness for congressional oversight. We  previously recommended that OMB and Treasury provide additional  instruction to agencies on how to report Primary Place of Performance to  ensure the definitions are clear and the data standards are implemented  consistently by agencies.", "Staff from one congressional committee cautioned that attempts to  present information on budget authorities for fees, fines, and penalties in  a simple and accessible database create an unacceptable risk of  confusion and legislative error. The staff said an accurate description of  the nature of the spending\u2013-including whether there is authority to  obligate without further appropriation\u2013-would be labor intensive and  require significant legal analysis and research."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Government-wide Reporting Would Require an Investment of Federal Resources", "paragraphs": ["Government-wide reporting of fees, fines, and penalties could increase  transparency and facilitate oversight and decision-making, but would  require time and resources to develop given that there is currently no  government-wide system or requirements for agencies to collect and  report detailed fee, fine, and penalty data. The level of federal investment  would vary depending on factors, such as the number of data elements  included and the level of detail reported. Developing a comprehensive  and accessible data source would provide greater benefits, but would  likely be resource intensive. We have reported on other federal  transparency efforts that could provide strategies for reporting  government-wide fee, fine, and penalty data. For example, to create a  clear and accessible government-wide data source that includes the data  elements we identified that would be useful for congressional oversight,  Treasury officials said the process would be similar to the implementation  of the DATA Act for spending data. To implement the DATA Act, OMB  and Treasury led an intensive effort starting in May 2014 through May  2017 when the first government-wide data were reported under the DATA  Act\u2019s new standards.", "Data Standards: OMB, in coordination with Treasury, established 57  standardized data element definitions and approximately 400  associated sub-elements for reporting federal spending information.  OMB and Treasury created opportunities for non-federal stakeholders  to provide input into the development of data standards, including  publishing a Federal Register notice seeking public comment on the  establishment of financial data standards; presenting periodic updates  on the status of DATA Act implementation to federal and non-federal  stakeholders at meetings and conferences; soliciting public comment  on data standards using an online collaboration space; and  collaborating with federal agencies on the development of data  standards and the technical schema through MAX.gov, an OMB- supported website.", "Technical Process for Reporting: Treasury developed the initial  DATA Act Information Model Schema, which provided information on  how to standardize the way financial assistance awards, contracts,  and other financial and nonfinancial data would be collected and  reported under the DATA Act.", "System to Collect and Validate Data: Treasury developed a system  that collects and validates agency data (the DATA Act Broker), which  operationalizes the reporting framework laid out in the schema. In  addition, Treasury employed online software development tools to  provide responses to stakeholder questions and comments related to  the development and revision of the broker.", "Public Reporting: Treasury created and updated the new  USAspending.gov website to display certified agency data submitted  under the DATA Act.", "Agencies also took steps to prepare to report spending data. They  reviewed data elements OMB identified, participated in standardizing the  definitions, performed an inventory of their existing data and associated  business processes, and updated their systems and processes to report  data to Treasury. OMB and Treasury issued policy directions to help  agencies meet their reporting requirements under the act. They also  conducted a series of meetings with participating agencies to obtain  information on any challenges that could impede effective implementation  and assess agencies\u2019 readiness to report required spending data.", "Although the steps to developing comprehensive, detailed reporting on  government-wide collections of fees, fines, and penalties might be similar  to the DATA Act efforts, the dollar amounts of collections would be  smaller than those of federal spending. In fiscal year 2017, federal  spending was $3.98 trillion compared to about $350 billion in collections  of fees, fines, penalties, and forfeitures reported by OMB.  On the other  hand, defining data elements and standards for fee, fine, and penalty data  could be more resource intensive than developing data standards for  DATA Act implementation because the DATA Act built on earlier reporting  requirements. The DATA Act amended the Federal Funding  Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (FFATA), which required  OMB to establish the website USAspending.gov to report data on federal  awards, including contracts, grants, and loans. The DATA Act required  OMB and Treasury to standardize data required to be reported by  FFATA. For fee, fine, and penalty data, OMB and Treasury would be  starting without the benefit of some data elements already defined.  Further, we have previously reported that effective implementation of  provisions to make federal data publicly available, including the DATA Act  and GPRAMA\u2019s program inventory, especially the ability to crosswalk  spending data to individual programs, could provide vital information to  assist federal decision makers in addressing significant challenges the  government faces.", "Incorporating a small number of data elements that Congress identifies as  most useful for oversight into ongoing government-wide agency reporting  efforts could incrementally improve transparency and information for  oversight and decision-making, with fewer resources. For example,  Congress required agencies to add selected data elements to their  annual financial reports on civil monetary penalties. Specifically, the  Federal Civil Penalties Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015  requires agencies to include information about the civil monetary  penalties within the agencies\u2019 jurisdiction, including catch-up inflation  adjustment of the civil monetary penalty amounts, in annual agency  financial reports or performance and accountability reports. As shown in  figure 7, to facilitate agencies\u2019 reporting, OMB provided a table to define  the data elements required in the act in its annual instructions, OMB  Circular No. A-136, Financial Reporting Requirements.", "Agencies started reporting these data in their agency financial reports in  fiscal year 2016. In July 2018, we reported that 40 of 45 required  agencies reported in their fiscal year 2017 agency financial report  information on civil monetary penalties as directed by the OMB  instructions. Similarly, if Congress sought additional fine and penalty  data elements, such as amounts collected and authority to spend  collections, OMB could expand this table in Circular No. A-136 to include  those data elements. Circular No. A-136 also outlines that agencies may  include the results of biennial reviews of fees and other collections in their  agency financial reports. OMB could also update this portion of the  circular to require agencies to report specific data elements that are  useful for oversight, such as review and reporting requirements. While  this information reported in agency financial reports would be  disaggregated in portable document format, or PDF, documents, it would  provide some transparency on agencies\u2019 activities that Congress could  use to prioritize its oversight efforts.", "In another example, if OMB implements the federal program inventory as  required by GPRAMA, it could include a data element on whether a  program has a fee, fine, or penalty. We previously reported that the  principles and practices of information architecture\u2014a discipline focused  on organizing and structuring information\u2014offer an approach for  developing such an inventory to support a variety of uses, including  increased transparency for federal programs. A program inventory  creates the potential to aggregate, disaggregate, sort, and filter  information across multiple program facets. For example, from a user\u2019s  perspective, a program could be tagged to highlight whether it includes  activities to collect fees, fines, or penalties. Then, a user interested in this  data facet could select a tag (e.g., fees) that could generate a list of  programs that also have fees, fines, or penalties. While the program  inventory is broader than agency collections of fees, fines, and penalties  and would include programmatic descriptions, it would increase  transparency by enabling Congress and the public to identify and isolate  all programs that include, as a source of funding or a key data element, a  fee, fine, or penalty to inform oversight and target additional requests for  information to agencies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies are authorized to collect hundreds of billions of dollars  from fees, fines, and penalties each year that fund a wide variety of  programs, but Congress and the American public do not have  government-wide data on these collections that would provide increased  transparency and facilitate oversight.

First, until OMB describes how it identifies  accounts with fees including that the government-wide totals of fees it  reports in Analytical Perspectives may include collections that are not  fees and exclude some fee collections, some users will likely be unaware  that reported totals could be over- or under-estimates. Second, without  OMB instruction to agencies to regularly review and update  implementation of the criteria for designating accounts that contain fees,  accounts could be designated incorrectly if the makeup of the collections  changes. Therefore, OMB cannot provide reasonable assurance that the  total amount of fees it reports is accurate. Third, until OMB describes in  the User\u2019s Guide that its Public Budget Database reports budget authority  net of offsetting collections, including collections of fees, fines, and  penalties, users could misinterpret the information and underestimate  collections in some cases.", "OMB and Treasury do not collect many of the data elements on fees,  fines, and penalties that would be useful for congressional oversight, such  as review and reporting requirements. There are trade-offs between the  potential costs and the potential benefits. While reporting government- wide data on specific fees, fines, and penalties would improve  transparency and information for decision-making, more data elements  would require greater investment of resources from OMB, Treasury, and  agencies. Any new reporting of fee, fine, and penalty data would be most  useful if it is designed to be compatible with other transparency efforts\u2014 the DATA Act reporting and the federal program inventory.
