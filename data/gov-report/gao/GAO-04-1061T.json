By 2003, opinion research indicated that foreign publics, especially in countries with large Muslim populations, viewed the United States unfavorably. GAO issued two studies in 2003 that examined (1) changes in U.S. public diplomacy resources and programs since September 11, 2001, within the State Department (State) and the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG); (2) the U.S. government's strategies for its public diplomacy programs and measures of effectiveness; and (3) the challenges that remain in executing U.S. public diplomacy efforts. GAO made several recommendations to State and the BBG to address planning and performance issues. Both agencies agreed with these recommendations and have made some progress in implementing them. On July 22, 2004, the 9/11 Commission released its report and recommendations. Two of the Commission's recommendations relate to the management of U.S. public diplomacy. For this testimony, GAO was asked to discuss its prior work as it relates to these recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since September 11, 2001, State has expanded its public diplomacy efforts in Muslim-majority countries considered to be of strategic importance in the war on terrorism. It significantly increased resources in South Asia and the Near East and launched new initiatives targeting broader, younger audiences--particularly in predominantly Muslim countries. These initiatives are consistent with the 9/11 Commission's recommendation that the United States rebuild its scholarship, library, and exchange programs overseas. Since 9/11, the BBG has initiated several new programs focused on attracting larger audiences in priority markets, including Radio Sawa and Arabic language television in the Middle East, the Afghanistan Radio Network, and Radio Farda in Iran. The 9/11 Commission report highlights these broadcast efforts and recommends that funding for such efforts be expanded. While State and BBG have increased their efforts to support the war on terrorism, we found that there is no interagency strategy to guide State's, BBG's, and other federal agencies' communication efforts. The absence of such a strategy complicates the task of conveying consistent messages to overseas audiences. Likewise, the 9/11 Commission recommended that the United States do a better job defining its public diplomacy message. In addition, we found that State does not have a strategy that integrates and aligns all its diverse public diplomacy activities. State, noting the need to fix the problem, recently established a new office of strategic planning for public diplomacy. The BBG did have a strategic plan, but the plan lacked a long-term strategic goal or related program objective to gauge the Board's success in increasing audience size, the key focus of its plan. We also found that State and the BBG were not systematically and comprehensively measuring progress toward the goals of reaching broader audiences and increasing publics' understanding about the United States. The BBG subsequently made audience size a key performance goal and added broadcaster credibility and plans to add other performance measures that GAO recommended. In addition, State and BBG face several internal challenges in carrying out their programs. Challenges at State include insufficient public diplomacy resources and a lack of officers with foreign language proficiency. State officials are trying to address staffing gaps through increased recruitment. The BBG also faces a number of media market, organizational, and resource challenges that may hamper its efforts to generate large audiences in priority markets. It has developed a number of solutions to address these challenges."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss GAO\u2019s issued work on U.S. public  diplomacy efforts and to focus specifically on the Middle East and related  recommendations by the 9/11 Commission report.

Recent  opinion research indicates that foreign publics, especially in countries  with large Muslim populations, view the United States unfavorably. Last  September, we reported to the House International Relations Committee  on the State Department\u2019s public diplomacy efforts. In July 2003, we  issued a report for that committee on the progress that the Broadcasting  Board of Governors (BBG)\u2014the agency responsible for nonmilitary U.S.  international broadcasting\u2014has made in developing a new strategic  approach to reverse declining audience trends and support U.S. strategic  objectives such as the war on terrorism.

We also met with academics specializing in public diplomacy and  international affairs issues, and private sector officials from U.S. public  relations and opinion research firms with international operations. While  several government entities conduct public diplomacy activities, my  comments will focus on State\u2019s and BBG\u2019s efforts since they were the  subject of our work.

Public diplomacy is carried out through a  wide range of programs that employ person-to-person contacts; print,  broadcast, and electronic media; and other means. Traditionally, U.S.  public diplomacy focused on foreign elites\u2014current and future overseas  opinion leaders, agenda setters, and decision makers. However, the  dramatic growth in global mass communications and other trends have  forced a rethinking of this approach, and State has begun to consider  techniques for communicating with broader foreign audiences. The BBG,  as the overseer of U.S. international broadcasting efforts, supports U.S.  public diplomacy\u2019s key objectives by broadcasting fair and accurate  information about the United States, while maintaining its journalistic  independence as a news organization. The BBG manages and oversees the  Voice of America (VOA), WorldNet Television, Radio/TV Marti, Radio Free  Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Farda, the Middle East Television Network  (which consists of Radio Sawa and Alhurra, the Board\u2019s new Arabic  language television station), the Afghanistan Radio Network, and Radio  Free Asia.

The remainder covers mostly salaries and expenses  incurred by State and embassy officers engaged in information  dissemination, media relations, cultural affairs, speaker programs,  publications, and other activities. BBG\u2019s budget for fiscal year 2004 is $546  million. This includes more than $42 million for radio and television  broadcasting to the Middle East. Since initiating the language service  review process in 1999, the Board has reduced the scope of operations of  more than 25 language services and reallocated about $19.7 million in  funds, with the majority redirected toward Central Asia and the Middle  East, including $8 million for Radio Farda service to Iran."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "More Public Diplomacy Resources Shifting to Muslim- Majority Countries", "paragraphs": ["Since September 11, 2001, State has expanded its efforts in Muslim- majority countries that are considered strategically important in the war  on terrorism.

The BBG has also targeted recent initiatives to  support the war on terrorism, including Radio Sawa in the Middle East; the  Afghanistan Radio Network; and the new Radio Farda service to Iran. In  addition, the Board expanded its presence in the Middle East through the  launch of the Alhurra satellite television network in mid-February 2004.

Public  diplomacy funding increased in South Asia from $24 million to $39 million  and in the Near East from $39 million to $62 million, or by 63 and 58  percent, respectively, from fiscal year 2001 through 2003.

In 2003, State has continued to emphasize  exchanges with Muslim countries through its Partnership for Learning  Program\u2014designed to target young and diverse audiences through  academic and professional exchanges such as the Fulbright, International  Visitor, and Citizen Exchange programs. According to State, under this  program, 170 high school students from predominantly Islamic countries  have already arrived and are living with American families and studying at  local high schools. State has also carried out increased exchanges through  its Middle East Partnership Initiative, which includes computer and  English language training for women newly employed by the Afghan  government and a program to assist women from Arab countries and  elsewhere in observing and discussing the U.S. electoral process. In  addition, State is expanding its American Corners program, as  recommended by the Advisory Group on Public Diplomacy in October  2003.

Radio Sawa replaced the poorly  performing VOA Arabic service, which had listening rates at around 2  percent of the population. According to BBG survey research, Radio Sawa  is reaching 51 percent of its target audience and is ranked highest for news  and news trustworthiness in Amman, Jordan. Despite such results, it  remains unclear how many people Radio Sawa reaches throughout the  entire Middle East because audience research has been performed only in  selected markets. Further, the State Inspector General and the Advisory  Group on Public Diplomacy for the Arab and Muslim World have raised  questions about whether Radio Sawa has focused more on audience size  and composition than on potential impact on attitudes in the region. The  BBG has also launched the Afghanistan Radio Network and a language  service to Iran called Radio Farda.

Immediately after September 11, 2001, the White House,  State Department, Department of Defense, and other agencies coordinated  various public diplomacy efforts on a day-to-day basis, and the White  House established a number of interim coordination mechanisms. One  such mechanism was the joint operation of the Coalition Information  Centers in Washington, London, and Islamabad, set up during the early  stages of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan in 2001.

Public affairs officers who responded to our survey indicated that the lack  of a strategy has hindered their ability to effectively execute public  diplomacy efforts overseas. More than 66 percent of public affairs officers  in one region reported that the quality of strategic guidance from the  Office of the Undersecretary at the time of our review (10/01-3/03) was  generally insufficient or very insufficient. More than 40 percent in another  region reported the same. We encountered similar complaints during our  overseas fieldwork. For example, in Morocco, the former public affairs  officer stated that so little information had been provided from  Washington on State\u2019s post-September 11 public diplomacy strategy that  he had to rely on newspaper articles and guesswork to formulate his in- country public diplomacy plans.", "During our audit work, we learned that private sector public relations  efforts and political campaigns use sophisticated strategies to integrate  complex communication efforts involving multiple players. Although  State\u2019s public diplomacy efforts extend beyond the activities of public  relations firms, many of the strategic tools that such firms employ are  relevant to State\u2019s situation. While it is difficult to establish direct links  between public diplomacy programs and results, other U.S. government  agencies and the private sector have best practices for assessing  information disseminating campaigns, including the need to define success  and how it should be measured. Executives from some of the largest  public relations firms in the United States told us that initial strategic  decisions involve establishing the scope and nature of the problem,  identifying the target audience, determining the core messages, and  defining both success and failure. Subsequent steps include conducting  research to validate the initial decisions, testing the core messages,  carrying out pre-launch activities, and developing information materials.

Many officers also  reported that staffing at posts was insufficient to carry out the long-range  monitoring required to adequately measure program effectiveness. Even if  sufficient staffing were available, State would still have difficulty  conducting long-range tracking of exchange participants because it lacks a  database with comprehensive information on its various exchange  program alumni.
