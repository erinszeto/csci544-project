Over the past 10 years, Indian Affairs has undergone several organizational realignments, resulting in multiple offices across different units being responsible for BIE schools' education and administrative functions. Indian Affairs' fragmented organization has been compounded by frequent turnover in its leadership over a 13-year period and its lack of a strategic plan for BIE. Further, fragmentation and poor communication among Indian Affairs offices has led to confusion among schools about whom to contact about problems, as well as delays in the delivery of key educational services and supplies, such as textbooks. Key practices for organizational change suggest that agencies develop a results-oriented framework, such as a strategic plan, to clearly establish and communicate performance goals and measure their progress toward them. In 2013, GAO recommended that Interior develop a strategic plan for BIE and a strategy for communicating with schools, among other recommendations. Indian Affairs agreed with and reported taking some steps to address the two recommendations. However, it has not fully implemented them.", "Limited staff capacity poses another challenge to addressing BIE school needs. According to key principles for effective workforce planning, the appropriate deployment of employees enables organizations to have the right people, with the right skills, in the right places. However, Indian Affairs data indicate that about 40 percent of its regional facility positions, such as architects and engineers, are vacant. Similarly, in 2014 GAO reported that BIE had many vacancies in positions to oversee school spending. Further, remaining staff had limited financial expertise and training. Without adequate staff and training, Indian Affairs will continue to struggle in monitoring and supporting schools. GAO recommended that Interior revise its workforce plan so that employees are placed in the appropriate offices and have the requisite knowledge and skills to better support schools. Although Indian Affairs agreed with this recommendation, it has not yet implemented it.", "Inconsistent accountability hampers management of BIE school construction and monitoring of school spending. Specifically, GAO has found that Indian Affairs did not consistently oversee some construction projects. For example, at one school GAO visited, Indian Affairs spent $3.5 million to replace multiple roofs in 2010. The new roofs have leaked since their installation, causing mold and ceiling damage, and Indian Affairs has not yet adequately addressed the problems, resulting in continued leaks and damage to the structure. Inconsistent accountability also impairs BIE's monitoring of school spending. In 2014 GAO found that BIE does not adequately monitor school expenditures using written procedures or a risk-based monitoring approach, contrary to federal internal control standards. As a result, BIE failed to provide effective oversight of schools when they misspent millions of dollars in federal funds. GAO recommended that the agency develop written procedures and a risk-based approach to improve its monitoring. Indian Affairs agreed but has yet to implement these recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to testify today to discuss systemic  management challenges facing the Department of the Interior\u2019s (Interior)  Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) schools. For the past several years, we  have reported on a broad range of issues related to BIE\u2019s education  programs and operations. Currently, BIE oversees 185 elementary and  secondary schools that serve approximately 41,000 students on or near  Indian reservations in 23 states, often in rural areas and small towns.  About two-thirds of these schools are operated by tribes (tribally- operated), primarily through federal grants, and about one-third are  operated directly by BIE (BIE-operated). BIE\u2019s mission is to provide Indian  students with quality education opportunities. Poor student outcomes,  however, raise questions about how well BIE is achieving its mission. For  example, in September 2013, we reported that student performance at  BIE schools had been consistently below Indian students in public  schools. High school graduation rates for BIE schools were also lower  than the national average. In addition, recent reports have raised  concerns about the physical condition of school facilities and the effect  these conditions may have on the educational outcomes of Indian  students who attend them.", "My remarks today will focus on management challenges to improving  Indian education, which is overseen by Interior\u2019s Office of the Assistant  Secretary\u2013Indian Affairs (Indian Affairs).

My statement is based on our prior reports  on BIE\u2019s management of schools and its oversight of school spending,  which were issued in September 2013 and November 2014, and on my  February 2015 testimony on our ongoing work on the condition of BIE  school facilities for the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior,  Environment, and Related Agencies.", "To perform this work, we used multiple data collection methodologies.  Specifically, we reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations; analyzed  agency data and conducted site visits to schools, which were selected to  reflect a mix of tribally-operated and BIE-operated schools, geographic  diversity, and other factors. We also reviewed Indian Affairs\u2019 budget  documents and the Department of Education\u2019s (Education) student  performance data, and conducted interviews with agency officials. We  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  our work. Further details on the scope and methodology are available  within each of the previously published products.

In accordance with this trust  responsibility, Interior is responsible for providing a safe and healthy  environment for students to learn. BIE\u2019s mission is to provide Indian  students with quality education opportunities.

Specifically, these elementary and secondary schools  received approximately $830 million in fiscal year 2014\u2014including about  75 percent, or about $622 million, from Interior and about 24 percent, or  approximately $197 million, from Education. BIE schools also received  small amounts of funding from other federal agencies (about 1 percent),  mainly the Department of Agriculture, which provides reduced-price or  free school meals for eligible low-income children. (See fig. 1).", "While BIE schools are primarily funded through Interior, they receive  annual formula grants from Education, similar to public schools.  Specifically, schools receive Education funds under Title I, Part A of the  Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965, as amended,  and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Title I\u2014the largest  funding source for kindergarten through grade 12 under ESEA\u2014provides  funding to expand and improve educational programs in schools with  students from low-income families and may be used for supplemental  services to improve student achievement, such as instruction in reading  and mathematics. An Education study published in 2012 found that all  BIE schools were eligible for Title I funding on a school-wide basis  because they all had at least 40 percent of children from low-income  households in school year 2009-10. Further, BIE schools receive  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act funding for special education  and related services, such as physical therapy or speech therapy. BIE  schools tend to have a higher percent of students with special needs than  students in public schools nationally.", "BIE schools\u2019 educational functions are primarily the responsibility of BIE,  while their administrative functions are divided mainly between two other  Interior offices.", "The Bureau of Indian Education develops educational policies and  procedures, supervises program activities, and approves schools\u2019  expenditures.

In addition  to BIE, multiple offices within BIA and the Office of the Deputy Assistant  Secretary of Management have responsibilities for educational and  administrative functions for BIE schools. Notably, when the Assistant  Secretary for Indian Affairs was asked at a February 2015 hearing to  clarify the responsibilities that various offices have over BIE schools, he  responded that the current structure is \u201ca big part of the problem\u201d and that  the agency is currently in the process of realigning the responsibilities  various entities have with regard to Indian education, adding that it is a  challenging and evolving process. Indian Affairs provided us with a chart  on offices with a role in supporting and overseeing just BIE school  facilities that shows numerous offices across three organizational  divisions. (See fig. 4.)", "The administration of BIE schools has undergone several reorganizations  over the years to address persistent concerns with operational  effectiveness and efficiency. In our 2013 report, we noted that for a brief  period from 2002 to 2003, BIE was responsible for its own administrative  functions, according to BIE officials. However, in 2004 its administrative  functions were centralized under the Office of the Deputy Assistant  Secretary for Management. More recently, in 2013 Indian Affairs  implemented a plan to decentralize some administrative responsibilities  for schools, delegating certain functions to BIA regions. Further, in June  2014, the Secretary of the Interior issued an order to restructure BIE by  the start of school year 2014-15 to centralize the administration of  schools, decentralize services to schools, and increase the capacity of  tribes to directly operate them, among other goals. Currently, Indian  Affairs\u2019 restructuring of BIE is ongoing.", "In our 2013 report, we found that the challenges associated with the  fragmented administration of BIE schools were compounded by repeated  turnover in leadership over the years, including frequent changes in the  tenure of acting and permanent assistant secretaries of Indian Affairs  from 2000 through 2013. We also noted that frequent leadership changes  may complicate efforts to improve student achievement and negatively  affect an agency\u2019s ability to sustain focus on key initiatives.", "Indian Affairs\u2019 administration of BIE schools has also been undermined by  the lack of a strategic plan for guiding its restructuring of BIE\u2019s  administrative functions and carrying out BIE\u2019s mission to improve  education for Indian students. We previously found that key practices for  organizational change suggest that effective implementation of a results- oriented framework, such as a strategic plan, requires agencies to clearly  establish and communicate performance goals, measure progress toward  those goals, determine strategies and resources to effectively accomplish  the goals, and use performance information to make the decisions  necessary to improve performance.BIE officials said that developing a strategic plan would help its leadership  and staff pursue goals and collaborate effectively to achieve them. Indian  Affairs agreed with our recommendation to develop such a plan and   We noted in our 2013 report that  recently reported it had taken steps to do so. However, the plan has yet to  be finalized.", "Fragmented administration of schools may also contribute to delays in  providing materials and services to schools. For example, our previous  work found that the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for  Management\u2019s lack of knowledge about the schools\u2019 needs and expertise  in relevant education laws and regulations resulted in critical delays in  procuring and delivering school materials and supplies, such as  textbooks. In another instance, we found that the Office of the Deputy  Assistant Secretary for Management\u2019s processes led to an experienced  speech therapist\u2019s contract being terminated at a BIE school in favor of a  less expensive contract with another therapist. However, because the  new therapist was located in a different state and could not travel to the  school, the school was unable to fully implement students\u2019 individualized  education programs in the timeframe required by the Individuals with  Disabilities Education Act. In addition, although BIE accounted for  approximately 34 percent of Indian Affairs\u2019 budget, several BIE officials  reported that improving student performance was often overshadowed by  other agency priorities. This hindered Indian Affairs\u2019 staff from seeking  and acquiring expertise in education issues.", "In our 2013 report, we also found that poor communication among Indian  Affairs offices and with schools about educational services and facilities  undermines administration of BIE schools. According to school officials  we interviewed, communication between Indian Affairs\u2019 leadership and  BIE is weak, resulting in confusion about policies and procedures. We  have reported that working relations between BIE and the Office of the  Deputy Assistant Secretary for Management\u2019s leadership are informal  and sporadic, and BIE officials noted having difficulty obtaining timely  updates from the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for  Management on its responses to requests for services from schools. In  addition, there is a lack of communication between Indian Affairs\u2019  leadership and schools. BIE and school officials in all four states we  visited reported that they were unable to obtain definitive answers to  policy or administrative questions from BIE\u2019s leadership in Washington,   For example, school officials in one state  D.C. and Albuquerque, NM.we visited reported that they requested information from BIE\u2019s  Albuquerque office in the 2012-13 school year about the amount of  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act funds they were to receive. The  Albuquerque office subsequently provided them three different dollar  amounts. The school officials were eventually able to obtain the correct  amount of funding from their local BIE office. Similarly, BIE and school  officials in three states reported that they often do not receive responses  from BIE\u2019s Washington, D.C. and Albuquerque offices to questions they  pose via e-mail or phone. Further, one BIE official stated that meetings  with BIE leadership are venues for conveying information from  management to the field, rather than opportunities for a two-way dialogue.", "We testified recently that poor communication has also led to confusion  among some BIE schools about the roles and responsibilities of the  various Indian Affairs\u2019 offices responsible for facility issues. For  example, the offices involved in facility matters continue to change, due  partly to two re-organizations of BIE, BIA, and the Office of the Deputy  Assistant Secretary for Management over the past 2 years. BIE and tribal  officials at some schools we visited said they were unclear about what  office they should contact about facility problems or to elevate problems  that are not addressed. At one school we visited, a BIE school facility  manager submitted a request in February 2014 to replace a water heater  so that students and staff would have hot water in the elementary school.  However, the school did not designate this repair as an emergency.  Therefore, BIA facility officials told us that they were not aware of this  request until we brought it to their attention during our site visit in  December 2014. Even after we did so, it took BIE and BIA officials over a  month to approve the purchase of a new water heater, which cost about  $7,500. As a result, students and staff at the elementary school went  without hot water for about a year.", "We have observed difficulties in providing support for the most basic  communications, such as the availability of up-to-date contact information  for BIE and its schools. For example, BIE schools and BIA regions use an  outdated national directory with contact information for BIE and school  officials, which was last published in 2011. This may impair communications, especially given significant turnover of BIE and school  staff. It may also hamper the ability of schools and BIA officials to share  timely information with one another about funding and repair priorities. In  one BIA region we visited, officials have experienced difficulty reaching  certain schools by email and sometimes rely on sending messages by fax  to obtain schools\u2019 priorities for repairs. This situation is inconsistent with  federal internal control standards that call for effective internal  communication throughout an agency. In 2013, we recommended that  Interior develop a communication strategy for BIE to update its schools  and key stakeholders of critical developments. We also recommended  that Interior include a communication strategy\u2014as part of an overall  strategic plan for BIE\u2014to improve communication within Indian Affairs  and between Indian Affairs and BIE staff. Indian Affairs agreed to these  two recommendations and recently reported taking some steps to  address them. However, it did not provide us with documentation that  shows it has fully implemented the recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Capacity to Support Schools Is Limited", "paragraphs": ["Limited staff capacity poses another challenge to addressing BIE school  needs. According to key principles of strategic workforce planning, the  appropriate geographic and organizational deployment of employees can  further support organizational goals and strategies and enable an  organization to have the right people with the right skills in the right  place. In 2013 we reported that staffing levels at BIA regional offices  were not adjusted to meet the needs of BIE schools in regions with  varying numbers of schools, ranging from 2 to 65. Therefore, we noted  that it is important to ensure that each BIA regional office has an  appropriate number of staff who are familiar with education laws and  regulations and school-related needs to support the BIE schools in its  region.", "Consequently, in 2013 we recommended that Indian Affairs  revise its strategic workforce plan to ensure that its employees providing  administrative support to BIE have the requisite knowledge and skills to  help BIE achieve its mission and are placed in the appropriate offices to  ensure that regions with a large number of schools have sufficient  support. Indian Affairs agreed to implement the recommendation but has  not yet done so.", "BIA regional offices also have limited staff capacity for addressing BIE  school facility needs due to steady declines in staffing levels for over a  decade, gaps in technical expertise, and limited institutional knowledge.  For example, our preliminary analysis of Indian Affairs data shows that  about 40 percent of BIA regional facility positions are currently vacant,  including regional facility managers, architects, and engineers who  typically serve as project managers for school construction and provide  technical expertise. Our work and other studies have cited the lack of  capacity of Indian Affairs\u2019 facility staff as a longstanding agency  challenge. Further, officials at several schools we visited said they face  similar staff capacity challenges. For example, at one elementary school  we visited, the number of maintenance employees has decreased over  the past decade from six employees to one full-time employee and a part- time assistant, according to school officials. As a result of the staffing  declines, school officials said that facility maintenance staff may  sometimes defer needed maintenance.", "Within BIE, we also found limited staff capacity in another area of school  operations\u2014oversight of school expenditures. As we reported in  November 2014, the number of key local BIE officials monitoring these  expenditures had decreased from 22 in 2011 to 13, due partly to budget  cuts. These officials had many additional responsibilities for BIE schools  similar to school district superintendents of public schools, such as  providing academic guidance. As a result, the remaining 13 officials had  an increased workload, making it challenging for them to effectively  oversee schools. For example, we found that one BIE official in North  Dakota was also serving in an acting capacity for an office in Tennessee  and was responsible for overseeing and providing technical assistance to  schools in five other states\u2014Florida, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, and  North Carolina.", "Further, we reported that the challenges BIE officials confront in  overseeing school expenditures are exacerbated by a lack of financial  expertise and training. For example, although key local BIE officials are  responsible for making important decisions about annual audit findings,  such as whether school funds are being spent appropriately, they are not  auditors or accountants. Additionally, as we reported in November 2014,  some of these BIE officials had not received recent training on financial  oversight. Without adequate staff and training, we reported that BIE will  continue struggling to adequately monitor school expenses.  Consequently, we recommended in 2014 that Indian Affairs develop a  comprehensive workforce plan to ensure that BIE has an adequate  number of staff with the requisite knowledge and skills to effectively  oversee BIE school expenditures. Indian Affairs agreed with our  recommendation but has not yet taken any action."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inconsistent Accountability Hampers Management of School Construction and Monitoring of School Spending", "paragraphs": ["Our work has shown that another management challenge, inconsistent  accountability, hinders Indian Affairs in the areas of (1) managing school  construction and (2) monitoring overall school expenditures.

According to agency and school officials  we interviewed, some recent construction projects, including new roofs  and buildings, went relatively well, while others faced numerous  problems. The problems we found with construction projects at some  schools suggest that Indian Affairs is not fully or consistently using  management practices to ensure contractors perform as intended. For  example, officials at three schools said they encountered leaks with roofs  installed within the past 11 years. At one BIE-operated school we visited,  Indian Affairs managed a project in which a contractor completed a $3.5  million project to replace roofs in 2010, but the roofs have leaked since  their installation, according to agency documents. These leaks have led  to mold in some classrooms and numerous ceiling tiles having to be  removed throughout the school. (See fig. 5.) In 2011 this issue was  elevated to a senior official within Indian Affairs, who was responsible for  facilities and construction. He stated that the situation was unacceptable  and called for more forceful action by the agency. Despite numerous  subsequent repairs of these roofs, school officials and regional Indian  Affairs officials told us in late 2014 that the leaks and damage to the  structure continue. They also said that they were not sure what further  steps, if any, Indian Affairs would take to resolve the leaks or hold the  contractors or suppliers accountable, such as filing legal claims against  the contractor or supplier if appropriate.", "In South Dakota, a school we visited recently encountered problems  constructing a $1.5 million building for bus maintenance and storage  using federal funds. According to Indian Affairs and school officials,  although the project was nearly finished at the time of our visit in  December 2014, Indian Affairs, the school, and the contractor still had not  resolved various issues, including drainage and heating problems.  Further, part of the new building for bus maintenance has one hydraulic  lift, but the size of the building does not allow a large school bus to fit on  the lift when the exterior door is closed because the building is not long  enough. Thus, staff using the lift would need to maintain or repair a large  bus with the door open, which is not practical in the cold South Dakota  winters. (See fig. 6.)", "According to Indian Affairs officials, part of the difficulty with this federally- funded project resulted from the school\u2019s use of a contractor responsible  for both the design and construction of the project, which limited Indian  Affairs\u2019 ability to oversee it. Indian Affairs officials said that this  arrangement, known as \u201cdesign-build,\u201d may sometimes have advantages,  such as faster project completion times, but may also give greater  discretion to the contractor responsible for both the design and  construction of the building. For example, Indian Affairs initially raised  questions about the size of the building to store and maintain buses.  However, agency officials noted that the contractor was not required to  incorporate Indian Affairs\u2019 comments on the building\u2019s design or obtain its  approval for the project\u2019s design, partly because Indian Affairs\u2019 policy  does not appear to address approval of the design in a \u201cdesign-build\u201d  project. Further, neither the school nor Indian Affairs used particular  financial incentives to ensure satisfactory performance by the contractor.  Specifically, the school already paid the firm nearly the full amount of the  project before final completion, according to school officials, leaving it little  financial leverage over the contractor. We will continue to monitor such  issues as we complete our ongoing work on BIE school facilities and  consider any recommendations that may be needed to address these  issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Uneven Accountability for School Spending", "paragraphs": ["In our 2014 report on BIE school spending, we found that BIE\u2019s oversight  did not ensure that school funds were spent appropriately on educational  services, although external auditors had determined that there were  serious financial management issues at some schools. Specifically,  auditors identified $13.8 million in unallowable spending by 24 BIE  schools as of July 2014. Additionally, in one case, an annual audit found  that a school lost about $1.2 million in federal funds that were illegally  transferred to an offshore bank account.accumulated at least another $6 million in federal funds in a U.S. bank  account. As of June 2014, BIE had not determined how the school  accrued that much in unspent federal funds.", "Further, instead of using a risk-based approach to its monitoring efforts,  BIE indicated that it relies primarily on ad hoc suggestions by staff  regarding which schools to target for greater oversight. For example, BIE  failed to increase its oversight of expenditures at one school where  auditors found that the school\u2019s financial statements had to be adjusted  by about $1.9 million. The same auditors also found unreliable accounting  of federal funds during a 3-year period we reviewed. We recommended  that Indian Affairs develop a risk-based approach to oversee school  expenditures to focus BIE\u2019s monitoring activities on schools that auditors  have found to be at the greatest risk of misusing federal funds. While  Indian Affairs agreed, it has not yet implemented this recommendation.", "In addition, we found that BIE did not use written procedures to monitor  schools\u2019 use of Indian School Equalization Program funds, which  accounted for almost half of their total operating funding in fiscal year  2014. In 2014 we recommended that Indian Affairs develop written  procedures, including for Interior\u2019s Indian School Equalization Program, to  consistently document their monitoring activities and actions they have  taken to resolve financial weaknesses identified at schools. While Indian  Affairs generally agreed, it has not yet taken this action. Without a risk- based approach and written procedures to overseeing school spending\u2014 both integral to federal internal control standards\u2014there is little assurance  that federal funds are being used for their intended purpose to provide  BIE students with needed instructional and other educational services.", "In conclusion, Indian Affairs has been hampered by systemic  management challenges related to BIE\u2019s programs and operations that  undermine its mission to provide Indian students with quality education  opportunities and safe environments that are conducive to learning. In  light of these management challenges, we have recommended several  improvements to Indian Affairs on its management of BIE schools. While  Indian Affairs has generally agreed with these recommendations and  reported taking some steps to address them, it has not yet fully  implemented them. Unless steps are promptly taken to address these  challenges to Indian education, it will be difficult for Indian Affairs to  ensure the long-term success of a generation of students. We will  continue to monitor these issues as we complete our ongoing work and  consider any additional recommendations that may be needed to address  these issues.", "Chairman Barrasso, Vice Chairman Tester, and Members of the  Committee, this concludes my prepared statement.
