Instead,  the UN relies on some in-country or local infrastructure and consumables.  Military and formed police unit equipment is provided by the troop- and  police-contributing countries. The UN reimburses these countries for  equipment at set rates. The UN cost of reimbursing countries for  deploying their equipment to CAR likely would be less than the amount  the United States would spend on airlifting the equipment to CAR alone.  For example, the UN cost of freight, deployment, and country  reimbursements for military and formed police equipment was  approximately $229 million over a 2-year period (July 2014 through June  2016), while in the hypothetical operation the U.S. cost of deploying  equipment alone would be over $382 million, which is about $154 million  more than the UN cost over a similar 2-year period (September 2014  through August 2016)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Differing Staffing and Compensation Practices for Military and Police Personnel Contribute to Higher U.S. Costs", "paragraphs": ["The United States would staff and compensate its military and police  personnel differently than the UN, leading to differences between the  estimated U.S. costs and actual UN costs.

DOD uses this tool to develop cost estimates for all  military contingency operations. The cost estimate included only the  incremental costs of the operation\u2014those directly attributable to the  operation that would not be incurred if the operation did not take place.  For example, the estimate produced by the cost estimating tool did not  include the direct salaries of active duty personnel as those costs would  be incurred by the United States regardless of a possible decision to  undertake the hypothetical operation. We assessed the cost estimating  tool\u2019s applicability to developing a hypothetical cost estimate for the  purposes of this report through discussions with DOD and IDA officials,  and compared the tool to the accurate and comprehensive characteristics  of a high-quality cost estimate, as described in the GAO Cost Estimating  and Assessment Guide. While we found the DOD cost estimating tool  generated a sufficiently reliable cost estimate for a hypothetical U.S.  peacekeeping operation, we did not assess the overall reliability of the  tool or its capability to generate accurate or comprehensive estimates for  future U.S. operations.", "To generate our estimate of U.S. military costs using the DOD\u2019s  estimating tool, we used UN military deployment numbers as a baseline  for the scale of a hypothetical, comparable U.S. peacekeeping operation,  while using unit sizes and rotations in deployment that were considered  appropriate for the U.S. military, according to DOD and IDA officials. We  based the hypothetical U.S. operation, and hence the cost estimate, on  the following assumptions, which correspond approximately with  MINUSCA\u2019s actual UN personnel deployments:", "Theater of operation: Central African Republic (CAR)", "Type of operation: military contingency", "Operation time frame: April 10, 2014 through June 30, 2017", "Military contingents: as of June 30, 2017, 11,495 total personnel  Infantry: 10 units of 630-785 personnel per unit, approximately 90  percent active duty / 10 percent reserves", "Communication / signals: 1 unit, 124 personnel per unit", "Engineering: 4 units, 200 personnel per unit", "Military police: 1 unit, 120 personnel per unit", "Formed police units (military police): 12 units, 140 personnel per", "Hospital / medical: 1 level III hospital, 248 beds, 495 personnel", "Helicopter units: 2 UH-60 C3 units, 1 MH-60M Assault attack  helicopter unit, 100 personnel per unit", "Quick reaction force: 1 unit, 160 personnel per unit", "Special forces: 1 tactical civilian affairs unit, 1 Marine special  operations intelligence unit, 160 personnel per unit", "Unmanned aerial vehicle: 1 unit, 84 personnel", "Transportation: 1 heavy transport unit, 120 personnel per unit", "Operational tempo: 1.0 for all phases of operation and units,  except aviation units (set at 1.5)", "Deployment schedule and phasing: phased deployment, including  14 days for predeployment (e.g., training), 5 days for deployment,  180 days for active duty unit sustainment and 270 days for  reserve unit sustainment, 5 days for redeployment, and 0 days for  reconstitution", "Housing: contractor-provided semi-permanent housing", "Transportation: personnel and equipment transported by airlift  from the United States (primarily Fort Hood, Texas), material  (such as water, food, and other consumables) transported by airlift  from Italy  We obtained input on the operational design for the military portion of the  cost estimate from DOD officials in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Office of  the Undersecretary of Defense-Policy, and the Office of the  Undersecretary of Defense-Comptroller, and IDA officials. However, the  military portions of the scenario and their corresponding cost estimate  have some limitations. As a result of rounding for some units, U.S. military  personnel numbers do not exactly match the MINUSCA deployment  levels. In addition, based on input from DOD officials, we attempted to  select military units that would provide an essential function per U.S.  common practices while keeping the overall personnel deployment level  as close as possible to MINUSCA\u2019s deployment level. An actual U.S.  military plan may differ significantly from the UN plan as a result of  differences between U.S. and UN military operations, structure, doctrine,  and circumstances at the time of the operation.", "To estimate U.S. civilian costs, we matched the number of U.S. civilian  police and personnel to the number serving in MINUSCA. We then  estimated the costs of deploying these U.S. civilian personnel in CAR for  the same time period as MINUSCA. We did not attempt to determine how  the U.S. government would actually implement civilian components of a  peacekeeping operation in CAR.", "To estimate U.S. civilian police costs, we met with State\u2019s Bureau of  International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) to identify  State\u2019s costs for civilian police contractors providing police training and  technical assistance in sub-Saharan Africa. Based on INL\u2019s input we  assumed that the base salary of civilian police would be grade 13, step 5  on the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s general schedule salary tables  for federal employees. In addition to the average base salary, we  identified other costs\u2014with input from INL\u2014including, among others,  personal equipment, travel from the United States, and State\u2019s published  allowances specific to CAR for local cost of living, post hardship  differential, danger pay, and living quarters. We applied the average cost  per officer to the average number of UN civilian police officers deployed in  MINUSCA.", "To estimate U.S. civilian personnel costs, we met with State\u2019s Bureau of  Budget and Planning to identify the costs of State Foreign Service officers  and locally employed staff, based on the number of UN international and  national civilian staff deployed to MINUSCA, respectively. We matched  the number of State Foreign Service officers for the U.S. cost estimate to  the number of UN international staff in MINUSCA, with input from State to  align the grade levels. The estimated costs for Foreign Service officers  include average salaries based on State\u2019s Foreign Service salary tables  and State\u2019s allowances specific to CAR, including local cost of living, post  hardship differential, and danger pay. We also met with State Bureau of  Budget and Planning officials to estimate other costs for Foreign Service  officers, which we included in our cost estimate, including post  assignment travel, administrative support costs, residential furnishings,  and residential guards, among others, but we did not assess the reliability  of these additional costs provided by State. In addition, State\u2019s Bureau of  Overseas Buildings Operations provided the actual costs of residential  leases for Foreign Service officers in CAR in fiscal year 2017, which we  used to estimate the cost of housing Foreign Service officers in CAR. We  also matched the number of State locally employed staff to the number of  UN national staff deployed to MINUSCA and added their average salaries  and other costs in CAR based on data provided by State\u2019s Bureau of the  Comptroller and Global Financial Services.", "While MINUSCA\u2019s expenditures also included costs for sending an  annual average of up to about 200 UN volunteers to CAR, State officials  told us that the United States generally would not send volunteers  through its assistance efforts to a high-risk post, such as CAR. Therefore,  we did not include any costs related to volunteers in the cost estimate.  We also did not include costs related to host-government-provided  personnel serving in MINUSCA. In addition, UN expenditures included  about $7 million for \u201cquick-impact projects\u201d to support local government  infrastructure and civil society initiatives. We did not include comparable  costs for quick-impact projects in our U.S. cost estimate because we did  not have a basis for matching these costs.", "To identify factors that affect cost differences between MINUSCA and a  hypothetical, comparable operation implemented by the United States, we  reviewed the U.S. cost estimate generated in conjunction with DOD, IDA,  and State officials, and identified significant areas of cost for the United  States and the assumptions incorporated in the estimate or factors  specified by U.S. officials that drive those costs. We compared the U.S.  cost estimate, including these significant areas of cost, to UN costs to  identify differences. We interviewed U.S. and UN officials regarding U.S.  and UN standards and policies that explain differences between  MINUSCA costs and the estimated costs of a U.S. operation.", "To identify stakeholder views on the relative strengths of UN and U.S.  peacekeeping operations, we reviewed UN reports on peacekeeping  operations and interviewed UN, DOD, and State officials.
