It oversees a broad array of programs central to protecting the  health, safety, and security of the American public. As the nation  confronts both new and long-standing challenges, the public expects the  government to be more transparent and accountable. This requires  federal agencies to focus on their performance and improving results. To  modernize the federal government and improve agencies\u2019 abilities to  achieve results, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released  the President\u2019s Management Agenda and its plan to reform and  reorganize the federal government. These initiatives propose a range of  reform efforts and priorities designed to address the complex and  interconnected challenges facing federal agencies.", "To successfully implement reforms and improve their operations and  results, agencies will need to robustly manage their performance. This  involves not only measuring progress toward goals, but also using that  information to identify and correct problems, improve program  implementation, and make other important management and resource  allocation decisions. However, for more than two decades, our work has  highlighted weaknesses in the use of performance information in decision  making across the federal government. For example, in September  2017, we found that the use of performance information (i.e., data collected to measure progress toward agency goals) in various decision- making activities generally was unchanged or even declined government- wide, as reported by federal managers on a periodic survey we have  conducted since 1997. These persisting weaknesses could hinder  agencies\u2019 abilities to achieve critical results.", "Based on the aggregated, government-wide level survey results  presented in our September 2017 report, you asked us to review  individual agencies\u2019 use of performance information in decision making.  This report assesses the extent to which:  the reported use of performance information and related leading  practices at 24 agencies has changed compared to our prior survey in  2013; being subject to data-driven reviews related to managers\u2019 reported  use of performance information and leading practices; and  the Executive Branch has taken actions to enhance agencies\u2019 use of  performance information in various decision-making activities.", "To address the first and second objectives, we analyzed relevant results  from our 2017 survey of federal managers on organizational performance  and management issues. We administered the web-based survey to a  stratified random sample of 4,395 managers at 24 agencies between  November 2016 and March 2017. We received usable questionnaires  from about 67 percent of the eligible sample. The weighted response rate  at each agency generally ranged from 57 percent to 82 percent, except  for the Department of Justice, which had a weighted response rate of 36  percent. The maximum margin of error for the government-wide  estimates was less than or equal to 6 percentage points, and the  maximum margin of error for agency estimates was less than 20  percentage points. These results are generalizable to the population of  managers government-wide and at each individual agency. The 2017  results are comparable to those from other surveys we conducted in  1997, 2000, 2003, 2007, and 2013.", "To further address the first objective, we conducted various statistical  analyses on selected survey questions related to the use of performance  information and practices that can promote such use. For the use of  performance information, we selected the same set of 11 survey  questions used in our last report on our 2013 survey that focused on  agency-level survey results. Using 2017 survey data, we conducted  statistical analyses and ensured that these 11 questions were still  positively correlated and no changes were necessary. As in that  September 2014 report, we updated our index to create a single score for  each agency to approximate its reported use of performance information  in decision making as of 2017. We also reviewed our 2017 survey and  identified 22 questions that reflect five management practices\u2014identified  by our past work\u2014that can promote the use of performance information in  decision making. Of those 22 questions, we selected 10 questions that  our analyses showed had statistically significant associations with greater  reported use of performance information.", "For the index and each question described above, we calculated results  for each agency based on the 2017 survey results. We then determined if  each agency\u2019s results were statistically significantly different from (1) their  prior results in 2013 and (2) the government-wide average results in  2017. We focus on statistically significant results throughout the report  because these indicate that observed relationships between variables  and differences between groups are likely to be valid, after accounting for  the effects of sampling and other sources of survey error. Because our  audit work was limited to analyzing and summarizing the results of our  2017 survey, we did not conduct any audit work at the agencies to  determine what may have caused any statistically significant changes.  Appendix I presents the relevant survey results for each of the 24  agencies.", "To further address the second objective, we used 2017 survey results to  identify managers who reported they were familiar with their agency\u2019s  data-driven reviews. For those who reported familiarity with the reviews,  we identified the extent managers reported that their programs had been  subject to those reviews. Based on the extent they were subject to  reviews, we assessed differences among managers\u2019 (1) index scores and  (2) responses on the 10 questions that reflect leading practices that can  promote the use of performance information.", "For the third objective, we identified and reviewed various resources (i.e.,  guidance, guides, and playbooks) developed by OMB and the  Performance Improvement Council (PIC) that could support agencies\u2019 use  of performance information. We also reviewed our past work that  assessed Executive Branch activities to enhance the use of performance  information. Lastly, we reviewed documents on recent cross-agency  efforts to improve the use of data in federal decision making, and  interviewed OMB and PIC staff about any actions they have taken, or  planned to take, to further support the use of performance information  across the federal government.

GPRA sought to focus federal agencies on performance by requiring  agencies to develop long-term and annual goals, and measure and report  on progress towards those goals annually. Based on our analyses of the  act\u2019s implementation, we concluded in March 2004 that GPRA\u2019s  requirements had laid a solid foundation for results-oriented  management. At that time, we found that performance planning and  measurement had slowly yet increasingly become a part of agencies\u2019  cultures. For example, managers reported having significantly more  performance measures in 2003 than in 1997, when GPRA took effect  government-wide.", "However, the benefit of collecting performance information is fully realized  only when that information is actually used by managers to make  decisions aimed at improving results. Although our 2003 survey found  greater reported availability of performance information than in 1997, it  also showed managers\u2019 use of that information for various management  activities generally had remained unchanged. Based on those results,  and in response to a request from Congress, in September 2005, we  developed a framework intended to help agencies better incorporate  performance information into their decision making. As shown in figure  1, we identified  five leading practices that can promote the use of performance  information for policy and program decisions; and  four ways agency managers can use performance information to  make program decisions aimed at improving results.", "Our September 2005 report also highlighted examples of how agencies  had used performance information to improve results. For example, we  described how the Department of Transportation\u2019s National Highway  Traffic Safety Administration used performance information to identify,  develop, and share effective strategies that increased national safety belt  usage\u2014which can decrease injuries and fatalities from traffic accidents\u2014 from 11 percent in 1985 to 80 percent in 2004.", "Subsequently, the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA) was  enacted, which significantly expanded and enhanced the statutory  framework for federal performance management. The Senate  Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs report  accompanying the bill that would become GPRAMA stated that agencies  were not consistently using performance information to improve their  management and results. The report cited the results of our 2007  survey of federal managers. That survey continued to show little change  in managers\u2019 use of performance information. The report further stated  that provisions in GPRAMA are intended to address those findings and  increase the use of performance information to improve performance and  results. For example, GPRAMA requires certain agencies to designate a  subset of their respective goals as their highest priorities\u2014known as  agency priority goals\u2014and to measure and assess progress toward those  goals at least quarterly through data-driven reviews.", "Our recent work and surveys suggest that data-driven reviews are having  their intended effect. For example, in July 2015, we found that agencies  reported that their reviews had positive effects on progress toward  agency goals and efforts to improve the efficiency of operations, among  other things. In addition, for those managers who were familiar with their  agencies\u2019 data-driven reviews, our 2013 and 2017 surveys showed that  the more managers viewed their programs as being subject to a review,  the more likely they were to report their agencies\u2019 reviews were driving  results and conducted in line with our leading practices. Recognizing the  important role these reviews were playing in improving data-driven  decision making, our management agenda for the presidential and  congressional transition in 2017 included a key action to expand the use  of data-driven reviews beyond agency priority goals to other agency  goals.", "More broadly, our recent surveys of federal managers have continued to  show that reported government-wide uses of performance information  generally have not changed or in some cases have declined. As we  found in September 2017, and as illustrated in figure 2, the 2017 update  to our index suggests that government-wide use of performance  information did not improve between 2013 and 2017.

This  could be because of the two different groups of agency officials covered  by our work. GPRAMA\u2019s requirements, and the federal performance  management framework established by OMB\u2019s guidance, apply at the  agency-wide level and generally involve senior leaders. Our past work  reviewing implementation of the act therefore focused on improvements  in the use of performance information by senior leaders at the agency- wide level. In contrast, our surveys covered random samples of mid- and  upper-level managers within those agencies, including at lower  organizational levels such as component agencies. Their responses  indicate that the use of performance information more broadly within  agencies\u2014at lower organizational levels\u2014generally has not improved  over time. The exception to this was managers whose programs were  subject to the data-driven reviews required by GPRAMA. As described  above, those managers were more likely to report greater use of  performance information in their agencies. This reinforces the value of the  processes and practices put in place by GPRAMA. Our survey results  suggest that limited actions have been taken to diffuse processes and  practices related to the use of performance information to lower levels  within federal agencies, where mid-level and senior managers make  decisions about managing programs and operations.", "Although OMB staff agreed that diffusing processes and practices to  lower levels could lead to improved use of performance information, they  told us they have not directed agencies to do so for a few reasons. First,  OMB staff expressed concerns about potentially imposing a \u201cone-size-fits- all\u201d approach on agencies. They stated that agencies are best positioned  to improve their managers\u2019 use of performance information, given their  individual and unique missions and cultures, and the environments in  which they operate. We agree that it makes sense for agencies to be able  to tailor their approaches for those reasons. OMB\u2019s existing guidance  provides an overarching framework that recognizes the need for flexibility  and for agencies to tailor their approaches. Moreover, given the long- standing and cross-cutting nature of this challenge, a government-wide  approach also would provide a consistent focus on improving the use of  performance information more extensively within agencies.", "OMB staff also told us that they believed it would go beyond their  mandate to direct agencies to extend GPRAMA requirements to lower  levels. GPRAMA requires OMB to provide guidance to agencies to  implement its requirements, which only apply at the agency-wide level. As  noted earlier, however, GPRAMA also requires OMB to develop cross- agency priority (CAP) goals to improve the performance and  management of the federal government. The President\u2019s Management  Agenda established a CAP goal to leverage data as a strategic asset, in  part, to improve the use of data for decision making and accountability  throughout the federal government. This new CAP goal presents an  opportunity for OMB and agencies to identify actions to expand the use of  performance information in decision making throughout agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Plan for New CAP Goal Does Not Yet Contain Required Elements for Successful Implementation", "paragraphs": ["As of June 2018, the action plan for implementing the Leveraging Data as  a Strategic Asset CAP goal is limited. According to the President\u2019s  Management Agenda and initial CAP goal action plan, the goal primarily  focuses on developing and implementing a long-term, enterprise-wide  federal data strategy to better govern and leverage the federal  government\u2019s data. It is through this strategy that, among other things, the  administration intends to improve the use of data for decision making and  accountability. However, the strategy is under development and not  expected to be released until January 2019, with a related plan to  implement it expected in April 2019.", "The existing action plan, released in March 2018 and updated in June  2018, does not yet include specific steps needed to improve the use of  data\u2014including performance information\u2014more extensively within  agencies. According to the action plan for the goal, potential actions  currently under consideration focus on establishing agency \u201clearning agendas\u201d that prioritize the development  and use of data and other evidence for decision-making; building agency capacity to use data and other evidence; and  improving the timeliness of performance information and other data,  and making that information available to decision makers and the  public.", "Although developing learning agendas and building capacity could help  improve the use of performance information in agencies, improving  availability of data may be less effective. For example, as our past survey  results have shown, increasing the availability of performance information  has not resulted in corresponding increases in its use in decision  making.", "We recognize that the CAP goal was created in March 2018.  Nonetheless, it is important that OMB and its fellow goal leaders develop  the action plan and related federal data strategy consistent with all key  requirements to better ensure successful implementation. The action plan  does not yet include complete information related to the following  GPRAMA requirements: performance goals that define the level of performance to be achieved  each year for the CAP goal;  the various federal agencies, organizations, programs, and other  activities that contribute to the CAP goal; performance measures to assess overall progress towards the goal  as well as the progress of each agency, program, and other activity  contributing to the goal; and  clearly defined quarterly targets.", "Consistent with GPRAMA, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government identifies information that agencies are required to include in  their plans to help ensure they achieve their goals. The standards state  that objectives\u2014such as improving the use of data in decision making\u2014 should be clearly defined to enable the identification of risks. Objectives  are to be defined in specific terms so they can be understood at all levels  of the entity\u2014in this case, government-wide as well as within individual  agencies. This involves defining what is to be achieved, who is to achieve  it, how it will be achieved, and the time frames for achievement.", "Ensuring that future updates to the new CAP goal\u2019s action plan includes  all required elements is particularly important, as our previous work has  found that some past CAP goal teams did not meet all planning and  reporting requirements. For example, in May 2016 we found that most  of the CAP goal teams we reviewed had not established targets for all  performance measures they were tracking. This limited the transparency  of their efforts and the ability to track progress toward established goals.  We recommended that OMB, working with the Performance Information  Council (PIC), report on actions that CAP goal teams are taking, or plan  to take, to develop such targets and performance measures. OMB staff  generally agreed and, in July 2017, told us they were working, where  possible, to assist the development of measures for CAP goals. However,  the recommendation has not been addressed and OMB staff said the  next opportunity to address it would be when the administration  established new CAP goals (which took place in March 2018). Following  the initial release of the new CAP goals, CAP goal teams are to more fully  develop the related action plans through quarterly updates. Given the  ongoing importance of meeting these planning and reporting  requirements, we will continue to monitor the status of actions to address  this recommendation as implementation of the new CAP goals proceeds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Our Survey Results Identify Additional Opportunities for the PIC to Improve Federal Use of Performance Information", "paragraphs": ["While the PIC, which is chaired by OMB, has contributed to efforts to  enhance the use of performance information, our survey results identify  additional opportunities to further those efforts. The PIC\u2019s past efforts  have included hosting various working groups and learning events for  agency officials to provide performance management guidance, and  developing resources with relevant practices. For example, the PIC  created a working group focused on agency performance reviews, which  was used to share recommendations for how agencies can implement  reviews, along with a guide with practices for effectively implementing  strategic reviews. In January 2018, staff supporting the PIC joined with  staff from another GSA office to create a new group called Fed2Fed  Solutions. This group consults with agencies and provides tailored  support, such as data analysis and performance management training for  agency officials, to help them address specific challenges related to  organizational transformation, data-driven decision making, and other  management improvement efforts.", "Our survey results identify useful information related to potential  promising practices and challenges that OMB and the PIC could use to  inform efforts to enhance the use of performance information more  extensively within agencies (e.g., at lower levels). As was previously  described, the PIC has responsibilities to (1) facilitate the exchange  among agencies of proven practices, and (2) work to resolve government- wide or cross-cutting performance issues, such as challenges. Our  analyses of 2017 survey results identified instances where agencies may  have found effective ways to enhance the use of performance information  by agency leaders and managers in decision making, as well as  instances where agencies (and their managers) face challenges in doing  so.", "Specifically, based on analyses of our survey responses, we identified 14  agencies that may have insights into specific practices that led to recent  improvements in managers\u2019 use of performance information, or ways that  they maintain relatively high levels of use by their managers when  compared to the rest of the government. Figure 9 summarizes the  agencies identified earlier in the report that had statistically significant  increases, or results higher than the government-wide average, on our  index or individual survey questions. As the figure shows, several  agencies had statistically significant results across all three sets of  analyses and therefore may have greater insights to offer: the General  Services Administration, National Aeronautics and Space Administration,  and the National Science Foundation.", "In addition, our analyses identified nine agencies where results suggest  managers face challenges that have hampered their ability to use  performance information. Figure 10 summarizes the agencies identified  earlier in the report that had statistically significant decreases, or results  lower than the government-wide average, on our index or individual  survey questions. As the figure shows, the Office of Personnel  Management had statistically significant decreases in all three sets of  analyses.", "Four agencies\u2014the Departments of the Treasury and Veterans Affairs,  the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Social Security  Administration\u2014were common to both of the figures above. That is, they  had results that indicate they may have insights on some aspects of using  performance information and face challenges in other aspects. As was  mentioned earlier, to provide proper context, these results should be  considered in relation to the range of agency results and the government- wide average (provided in detail in the agency summaries in appendix I).", "Given the prioritization of other activities, such as the recent creation of  the Fed2Fed Solutions program, the PIC has not yet undertaken a  systematic approach that could improve the use of performance  information by managers at lower levels within agencies. Such an  approach would involve identifying and sharing practices that have led to  improved use, as well as identifying common or cross-cutting challenges  that have hampered such use. The results of our analyses could help the  PIC do so, and in a more targeted manner. By identifying and sharing  proven practices, the PIC could further ensure that agency leaders and  managers are aware of effective or proven ways they can use  performance information to inform their decisions across the spectrum of  activities they manage within their agencies. Those proven practices also  may help agency leaders and managers resolve any identified  challenges.", "Furthermore, in September 2017, we found that, for the estimated 35  percent of managers who reported familiarity with data-driven reviews,  the more they viewed their programs being subject to a review, the more  likely they were to report the reviews were driving results and were  conducted in line with our leading practices for using performance  information. Despite the reported benefits of and results achieved through  data-driven reviews, they were not necessarily widespread. As noted  above, GPRAMA requires agencies to conduct such reviews for agency  priority goals, which represent a small subset of goals, and they are  required at the departmental level. These reasons may explain why most  managers reported they were not familiar with the reviews.", "As a result, we recommended that OMB should work with the PIC to  identify and share among agencies practices for expanding the use of  data-driven reviews. OMB staff agreed with our recommendation but have  yet to address it. In June 2018, OMB updated its annual guidance to  agencies to explicitly encourage them to expand data-driven reviews to  include other goals, priorities, and management areas as applicable to  improve organizational performance. However, as of June 2018, OMB  and the PIC have yet to take any steps to identify and share practices for  expanding the use of these reviews in line with our recommendation.  Given the additional analyses we conducted for this report\u2014which show  that being subject to data-driven reviews is related to greater reported use  of performance information and leading practices that promote such  use\u2014we continue to believe these further actions would help agencies  implement these reviews more extensively.

While the  Executive Branch has taken some actions in recent years, such as  establishing a framework for performance management across the  federal government, our survey results underscore that more needs to be  done to improve the use of performance information more extensively  within agencies and government-wide. The President\u2019s Management  Agenda and its related CAP goal to leverage data as a strategic asset  present an opportunity to do so, as it aims to improve data-driven  decision making. As OMB and its fellow goal leaders more fully develop  the action plan for achieving this goal, providing additional details for its  plans to improve data-driven decision making would help provide  assurance that it can be achieved.", "As part of those initiatives, our survey results could provide a useful guide  for targeting efforts. Officials at each agency could use these results to  identify areas for additional analysis and potential actions that could help  improve the use of performance information across the agency and at  lower levels. Similarly, OMB and the PIC could use the results to identify  broader issues in need of government-wide attention. It will also be  important, however, for OMB and the PIC to go beyond this analysis and  work with agencies to identify and share proven practices for increasing  the use of performance information at lower levels within agencies, as  well as challenges that may be hampering agencies\u2019 ability to do so."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following two recommendations to OMB:  The Director of OMB should direct the leaders of the Leveraging Data as  a Strategic Asset CAP Goal to ensure future updates to the action plan,  and the resulting federal data strategy, provide additional details on  improving the use of data, including performance information, more  extensively within federal agencies.

This report  assesses the extent to which:  1.  the reported use of performance information and related leading  practices at 24 agencies has changed compared to our prior survey in  2013;  2.  being subject to data-driven reviews related to managers\u2019 reported  use of performance information and leading practices; and  3.  the Executive Branch has taken actions to enhance agencies\u2019 use of  performance information in various decision-making activities.", "From November 2016 through March 2017, we administered our online  survey to a stratified random sample of 4,395 individuals from a  population of 153,779 mid- and upper-level civilian managers and  supervisors at the 24 CFO Act agencies. The management levels  covered general schedule (GS) or equivalent schedules at levels  comparable to GS-13 through GS-15, and career Senior Executive  Service (SES) or equivalent. We obtained the sample from the Office of  Personnel Management\u2019s Enterprise Human Resources Integration  database as of September 30, 2015\u2014the most recent fiscal year data  available at the time. The sample was stratified by agency and whether  the manager or supervisor was a member of the SES. To help determine  the reliability and accuracy of the database elements used to draw our  sample of federal managers for the 2017 survey, we checked the data for  reasonableness and the presence of any obvious or potential errors in  accuracy and completeness and reviewed our past analyses of the  reliability of this database. We concluded in our September 2017 report  that the data used to draw our sample were sufficiently reliable for the  purpose of the survey. For the 2017 survey, we received usable  questionnaires from about 67 percent of the eligible sample. The  weighted response rate at each agency generally ranged from 57 percent  to 82 percent, except the Department of Justice, which had a weighted  response rate of 36 percent. The overall survey results are generalizable  to the population of managers government-wide and at each individual  agency.", "To assess the potential bias from agencies with lower response rates, we  conducted a nonresponse bias analysis using information from the survey  and sampling frame as available. The analysis confirmed discrepancies in  the tendency to respond to the survey related to agency and SES status.  The analysis also revealed some differences in response propensity by  age and GS level; however, the direction and magnitude of the  differences on these factors were not consistent across agencies or  strata. Our data may be subject to bias from unmeasured sources for  which we cannot control. Results, and in particular estimates from  agencies with low response rates such as the Department of Justice,  should be interpreted with caution. However, the survey\u2019s results are  comparable to five previous surveys we conducted in 1997, 2000, 2003,  2007, and 2013.", "To address the first objective, we used data from our 2017 survey to  update agency scores on our use of performance information index.   This index, which was last updated using data from our 2013 survey,  averages managers\u2019 responses on 11 questions related to the use of  performance information for various management activities and decision  making. Using 2017 survey data, we conducted statistical analyses to  ensure these 11 questions were still positively correlated. That analysis  confirmed that no negative correlations existed and therefore no changes  to the index were needed. Figure 11 shows the questions that comprise  the index.", "After calculating agency index scores for 2017, we compared them to  previous results from 2007 and 2013, and to the government-wide  average for 2017, to identify any statistically significant differences. We  focus on statistically significant results because these indicate that  observed relationships between variables and differences between  groups are likely to be valid, after accounting for the effects of sampling  and other sources of survey error. For each of the 11 questions that  comprise the index, we identified individual agency results, excluding  missing and no basis to judge responses, and determined when they  were statistically significantly different from (1) the agency\u2019s results on the  same question in 2013, or (2) the government-wide average results on  the question in 2017. In this report, we analyzed and summarized the  results of our 2017 survey of federal managers. Due to the limited scope  of the engagement, we did not conduct additional audit work to determine  what may have caused statistically significant changes between our 2017  and past survey results.", "To further address this objective we completed several statistical  analyses that allowed us to assess the association between the index and  22 survey questions that we determined relate to leading practices we  previously found promote the use of performance information. See figure  12 for the 22 specific questions related to these five practices that we  included in the analysis.", "When we individually tested these 22 survey questions (bivariate  regression), we found that each was statistically significantly and  positively related to the index in 2017. This means that each question,  when tested in isolation from other factors, was associated with higher  scores on the index. However, when all 22 questions were tested  together (multivariate regression), we found that 5 questions continued to  be positively and significantly associated with the index in 2017, after  controlling for other factors.", "To conduct this multivariate analysis, we began with a base model that  treated differences in managers\u2019 views of agency performance  management use as a function of the agency where they worked. We  found, however, that a model based on agency alone had little predictive  power (R-squared of 0.04). We next examined whether managers\u2019  responses to these questions reflecting practices that promote the use of  performance information related to their perceptions of agency use of  performance information, independent of agency. The results of this  analysis are presented in table 1 below. Each coefficient reflects the  increase in our index associated with a one-unit increase in the value of a  particular survey question.", "Our final multivariate regression model had an R-squared of 0.67,  suggesting that the variables in this model explain approximately 67  percent of the variation in the use index. We also tested this model  controlling for whether a respondent was a member of the SES and found  similar results.", "As shown above in table 1, five questions related to three of the leading  practices that promote agencies\u2019 use of performance information were  statistically significant in 2017. These results suggest that, when  controlling for other factors, certain specific efforts to increase agency use  of performance information\u2014such as providing information on the validity  of performance data\u2014may have a higher return and lead to higher index  scores.", "With respect to aligning agency-wide goals, objectives, and  measures, we found that each increase in terms of the extent to which  individuals felt that managers aligned performance measures with  agencywide goals and objectives was associated with a 0.08 increase  in their score on the use index.", "In terms of improving the usefulness of performance information, we  found that having information on the validity of performance data for  decision making was the strongest predictor in our model (0.18). As  measured here, taking steps to ensure the performance information is  useful and appropriate was associated with almost as large a change  in a managers\u2019 index score (0.16).", "In terms of developing agency capacity to use performance  information, we found that having sufficient analytical tools to collect,  analyze, and use performance information (0.07), and providing or  paying for training that would help link their programs to achievement  of agency strategic goals (0.10), were also statistically significantly  related to a manager\u2019s reported use of performance information.", "When we combined these results with what we previously found through  a similar analysis of 2013 survey results in September 2014, we identified  10 questions that have had a statistically significant association with  higher index scores. This reinforces the importance of the five leading  practices to promote the use of performance information. For each of  these questions, which are outlined in figure 13 below, we determined  when agency results were statistically significantly different from 2013  results or the 2017 government-wide average.", "For the second objective, we examined, based on the extent they  responded their programs had been subject to agency data-driven  reviews, differences in managers\u2019 use index scores and responses on  questions related to practices that promote the use of performance  information. We grouped managers based on the extent they reported  their programs had been subject to these reviews, from \u201cno extent\u201d  through \u201cvery great extent.\u201d We then calculated the average index scores  for the managers in each of those five categories.", "We also examined differences in how managers responded to the 10  questions reflecting practices that can promote the use of performance  information based on the extent they reported their programs had been  subject to data-driven reviews. We grouped managers into three  categories based on the extent they reported their programs had been  subject to these reviews (no-small extent, moderate extent, great-very  great extent). We then compared how these groups responded to the ten  questions.", "For the third objective, we reviewed our past work that assessed Executive Branch activities to enhance  the use of performance information;  various resources (i.e., guidance, guides, and playbooks) developed  by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Performance  Improvement Council (PIC) that could support agencies\u2019 use of  performance information; and  the President\u2019s Management Agenda, and related materials with  information on cross-agency efforts to improve the use of data in  federal decision making.", "Lastly, for the third objective we also interviewed OMB and PIC staff  about any actions they have taken, or planned to take, to further support  the use of performance information across the federal government.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2017 to September  2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comparison of 2007, 2013, and 2017 Agency Use of Performance Information Index Scores", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the above contact, Benjamin T.
