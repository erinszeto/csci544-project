TANF's goals include ending the dependence of needy families on government benefits by promoting job preparation, work, and marriage; preventing and reducing the incidence of nonmarital pregnancies; and encouraging two-parent families. PRWORA expanded the scope of services that could potentially be contracted out, such as determining eligibility for TANF, which had traditionally been done by government employees.

HHS relies primarily on state single audit reports to oversee TANF contracting by states and localities. Their regional offices follow up on the TANF deficiencies identified by these reports, and HHS focuses on reported deficiencies that involve unallowable or questionable costs. However, HHS does not know the extent and nature of problems pertaining to the oversight of nongovernmental TANF contractors that have been cited by state single audits because they do not analyze the reports in a comprehensive manner. State and local governments rely on third parties to help ensure compliance with bid solicitation and contract award procedures, including bid protests, judicial processes, and external audits. State and local government agencies use various approaches to oversee TANF contractors, and problems have been identified with both contract oversight and contractor performance. State and local governments have primary responsibility for overseeing TANF contractors, and they rely on various approaches, including reviewing contractor-provided information and performing on-site reviews.

These measures heighten the importance of holding TANF contractors accountable for performance.", "In light of the upcoming reauthorization of TANF, you asked us to review the procedures in place to manage TANF contracting and the problems that have been identified in this area, particularly with regard to for-profit organizations. We determined (1) the extent and nature of state and local government contracting with for-profit and nonprofit organizations, using federal and state TANF funds to provide services to eligible recipients; (2) what approaches are used by the federal government to oversee TANF contracting with nongovernmental entities and what problems have been identified in this area nationally; (3) what approaches are used by state and local governments to ensure compliance with bid solicitation and contract award requirements and what violations of these requirements have been identified involving the awarding of contracts funded by TANF in selected jurisdictions; and (4) what approaches are used by state and local governments to ensure that organizations contracted to provide services funded by TANF comply with the terms of their contracts and what major instances of noncompliance with such requirements have been identified in selected jurisdictions.", "To respond to the first objective, we conducted a national survey of all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the 10 counties with the largest federal TANF-funding allocations in each of the 13 states that administer TANF locally. To respond to the second objective, we interviewed HHS officials in Washington, D.C., and in several regional offices and reviewed policies and other documentation related to federal TANF oversight. We also examined audits performed under the Single Audit Act of 1984. These comprehensive audits of expenditures of various federal program funds by state and local governments and nonprofit organizations conducted by nonfederal auditors or public accounting firms assess compliance with federal financial requirements, including those for TANF. To respond to the third and fourth objectives, we conducted state and local site visits in California (Los Angeles County and San Diego County); the District of Columbia; Florida (Palm Beach and Miami-Dade); New York (New York City); Texas (Austin and Houston); and Wisconsin (Milwaukee). We selected these states because of their substantial contracts with large for- profit organizations to provide services funded by TANF, large share of the national TANF caseload, and geographic dispersion. In each of these states and respective localities, we interviewed key officials, including procurement officers, contract managers, auditors, and contractors. In addition, we obtained and analyzed numerous documents, including reviews of contractors and contracting agencies. We conducted our review from January 2001 through March 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Under HHS\u2019s regulations, states must also ensure that contracts include any clauses required by federal statutes and executive orders. Grantees other than states and subgrantees, such as local governments, rely on their own procurement procedures, provided that they conform to applicable federal laws and the standards identified in the regulations, including standards of conduct, requirements of full and open competition in contracting, procedures for different types of procurements, and bid protest procedures to handle and resolve disputes relating to their procurements. Grantees and subgrantees must maintain a contract administration system that ensures that contractors perform in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications of their contracts.", "The procurement of contracts typically follows a process that comprises several phases, including bid solicitation and contract award processes. The bid solicitation process will begin with the development of a work plan by the contracting agency that outlines the objectives contractors will be expected to achieve and the manner in which they will be expected to achieve them. The state or locality will then issue a request-for-proposals to inform potential bidders of the government\u2019s interest in obtaining contractors for the work specified. A request-for-proposals is a publicly advertised document that outlines information necessary to enable prospective contractors to prepare proposals properly. After these activities are completed, the contract award process begins. Once proposals have been submitted, they are evaluated to assess their relative merit. Several key criteria are almost always considered in evaluating proposals, including price/cost, staffing, experience, and technical and/or other resources.", "The environment for administering social services such as TANF has been affected by changes to the nation\u2019s workforce system. Through the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) of 1998 (P.L. 105-220), the Congress sought to replace the fragmented training and employment system that existed under the previous workforce system. WIA requires state and local entities that carry out specified federal programs to participate in local one-stop centers\u2014local centers offering job placement assistance for workers and opportunities for employers to find workers\u2014by making employment and training-related services available. While TANF is not a mandatory partner at one-stop centers, some states are using one-stop centers to serve TANF recipients. WIA called for the development of workforce investment boards to oversee WIA implementation at the state and local levels. WIA listed the types of members that should participate on the workforce boards, such as representatives of business, education, labor, and other segments of the workforce investment community, but did not specify a minimum or maximum number of members. Local workforce boards can contract for services delivered through one-stop centers.", "PRWORA broadened both the types of TANF services that could be contracted out and the types of organizations that could serve as TANF contractors. The act authorized states to contract out the administration and provision of TANF services, including determining program eligibility. Under the prior AFDC program, the determination of program eligibility could not be contracted out to nongovernmental agencies.  In addition, under the PRWORA provision commonly referred to as charitable choice, states are authorized to contract with faith-based organizations to provide TANF services on the same basis as any other nongovernmental provider without impairing the religious character of such organizations.", "Such changes in the welfare environment have affected the involvement of for-profit organizations in TANF contracting. Prior to PRWORA, contracting in the welfare arena was mainly for direct service delivery such as job training, job search instruction, and child care provision. While some for-profit companies provided services, service providers were mostly nonprofit. Large for-profit companies were mainly involved as contractors that designed automated data systems.  In the broader area of social services, large for-profits were also involved in providing various services for child support enforcement.  Now that government agencies can contract out their entire welfare systems under PRWORA, there has been an increase in the extent to which large for-profit companies have sought out welfare contracts, in some cases on a large scale that includes determining eligibility and providing employment and social services.", "Federal and state funds are used to serve TANF recipients. For federal fiscal years 1997 to 2002, states received federal TANF block grants totaling $16.5 billion annually. With respect to state funding, PRWORA includes a maintenance-of-effort provision, which requires states to provide 75 to 80 percent of their historic level of funding. States that meet federally mandated minimum participation rates must provide at least 75 percent of their historic level of funding, and states that do not meet these rates must provide at least 80 percent. The federally mandated participation rates specify the percentages of states\u2019 TANF caseloads that must be participating in work or work-related activities each year.", "HHS oversees states\u2019 TANF programs. In accordance with PRWORA and federal regulations, HHS has broad responsibility to oversee the proper state expenditure of TANF funds and the achievement of related program goals.

The majority of these contracts are with nonprofit organizations. Although TANF contractors provide a wide array of services, the most commonly contracted services reported by our survey respondents include employment and training services, job placement services, and support services to promote job entry or retention. In addition, eligibility determination for cash assistance under TANF or other TANF-funded services has been contracted out in one or more locations in some states.

Contracting occurs only at the state level in 24 states, only at the local level in 5 states, at both levels in the remaining 20 states, and in the District of Columbia. Moreover, contracting at the local level encompasses contracting by agencies such as county departments of social or human services as well as workforce development boards whose jurisdiction may include several counties. Our national survey of TANF contracting provides comprehensive information on contracting at the state level but incomplete and nonrepresentative information on local contracting.", "In 2001, state and local governments expended at least $1.5 billion in TANF funds for contracted services. With respect to state-level contracting, contracts with nonprofit organizations accounted for 87 percent of TANF funds while contracts with for-profit organizations accounted for 13 percent of funds (see fig. 1). Seventy-three percent of state-level contracts are with nonprofit organizations and 27 percent are with for-profit organizations. Under PRWORA\u2019s charitable choice provision, some states have established initiatives to promote the use of faith-based organizations. Contracts with faith-based organizations constitute a smaller proportion of all contracted TANF funds than contracts with secular nonprofit organizations and for-profit organizations. As shown in figure 1, contracts with faith-based organizations account for 8 percent of TANF funds spent by state governments on contracts with nongovernmental entities nationally.", "In several states, large percentages of the funds contracted by states and localities that were identified by our national survey are in contracts with for-profit organizations.

As shown in table 1, the proportion of funds contracted out in 10 states in 2001 exceeded 20 percent of their fiscal year 2000 TANF fund expenditures (excluding the portion of expenditures for cash assistance). Idaho, Mississippi, New Jersey, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia expended more than 40 percent of their TANF funds on contracted services. On the other hand, Iowa, Kansas, North Carolina, New Mexico, and Oregon spent the smallest proportion (2 percent or less of their TANF funds) on contracts with nongovernmental entities.", "Several large for-profit organizations and nonprofit organizations have large TANF contracts in multiple states.

Among this group, Curtis & Associates, Inc., had the TANF contracts with the highest dollar value relative to other contractors in their respective locations. Among nonprofit contractors, Goodwill Industries, YWCA, Catholic Charities, Lutheran Social Services, Salvation Army, Urban League, United Way, Catholic Community Services, American Red Cross, and Boys & Girls Clubs all have TANF-funded contracts in two or more states.

Overall, states and localities rarely contract different types of services to nonprofit and for-profit organizations. Government entities contract out most often for services to facilitate employment.

These support services include substance abuse treatment, assistance with transportation, and other services that facilitate job entry and retention. Childcare services are less common. While the responses we obtained from local respondents about types of services contracted out may not be representative of local TANF contracting, they revealed a similar overall pattern to the responses by state respondents presented in figure 2. In some cases, states and localities have contracted with nongovernmental entities to provide program administrative functions that were required to be performed by government workers in the past, such as determining eligibility.  The determination of eligibility for TANF-funded services provided to low-income families who are ineligible for cash assistance has been contracted out in one or more locations in at least 18 states. For example, one Ohio county, which offers a variety of services with varying eligibility criteria to the working poor, contracts with nongovernmental organizations to both provide and determine eligibility for the services. Contractors in at least 4 states are contracting out eligibility for cash assistance under TANF, an option authorized under TANF.

As figure 3 shows, almost 60 percent of state respondents said that half or more of their TANF contracts are cost-reimbursement. Far fewer respondents report that half or more of their TANF contracts were incentive or cost-reimbursement plus incentive.  Under incentive contracts, the amount paid to contractors is determined based on the extent to which contractors successfully achieve specified program objectives for TANF recipients, such as job placements and the retention of jobs. Cost-reimbursement plus incentive contracts pay contractors for costs they incur and provide payments above costs for the achievement of specific objectives. While the responses we obtained from local respondents may not be representative of local TANF contracting, they revealed a similar pattern to the responses by state respondents. Our survey disclosed that many state and local governments have chosen to use a contract type\u2014cost-reimbursement\u2014under which the government assumes a relatively high level of financial risk.

However, the reported internal control weaknesses potentially impaired the ability of these states to properly oversee either their own TANF contractors or the monitoring of TANF contractors that have contracts with local governments. For example, the 2000 single audit report for Minnesota found that the state agency did not have policies and procedures in place to monitor the activities of TANF subrecipients. The 2000 audit report for Mississippi found that the state did not review single audits of some subrecipients in a timely manner and did not perform timely follow-up in some cases when subrecipients did not submit their single audits on time.

HHS officials told us that their reviews of single audit reports focus on TANF audit findings that cited unallowable or questionable costs, and that HHS tracks such findings in its audit resolution database.

We did not identify any audit reports that assessed the oversight of TANF contractors in California or the District of Columbia.", "Evolving TANF program structures, resource constraints, and data quality issues contributed to the deficiencies in contractor oversight. In Florida and Texas, for example, new TANF program structures entailed establishing local workforce boards throughout the state as the principal entity for TANF contracting and the subsequent oversight of TANF contractors. In both states, local workforce boards varied significantly in their capability to oversee TANF contractors and ensure compliance with contract requirements. According to New York State program officials, contracting agencies in the state continue to experience ongoing shortfalls in staff resources necessary to provide sufficient oversight of contractor performance. In addition, Wisconsin\u2019s Legislative Audit Bureau reported in 2001 that the Private Industry Council had not provided the requisite oversight of five TANF-funded contractors in Milwaukee County. In addition, state and local officials in other states frequently told us that data quality issues complicated efforts to monitor contractors effectively. For example, officials told us that case file information on job placements or job retention frequently differed from data in automated systems maintained by state or local contracting agencies. In New York City, such discrepancies required the Human Resources Administration to conduct time-consuming reviews and reconciliations of the data. Such inaccuracies forced delays in New York City\u2019s payments to contractors, estimated by city officials to total several million dollars.", "States and localities have taken actions in response to some of the reported contract oversight deficiencies. For example, state of Florida officials worked with local workforce boards to integrate the operations of welfare and employment offices to improve oversight of service providers, including nongovernmental contractors. In Texas, the Texas Workforce Commission issued new oversight policies and provided technical assistance and guidance to help local workforce boards oversee the performance of TANF contractors. For example, the commission\u2019s prior monitoring had identified inappropriate cost allocations across programs and other financial management problems by local boards.

State auditors reported that a large proportion of the disallowable costs resulted from the contractors claiming reimbursement from Wisconsin for expenses incurred while attempting to obtain TANF contracts in other states. Auditors said that generally accepted contract restrictions prohibit the use of contract funds obtained in one state from being used to obtain new contracts in other states. State auditors also said they examined whether there had been any preconceived intent underlying these prohibited contract practices, which could have led to charges of fraud. However, the auditors could not demonstrate preconceived intent or any related allegations of fraud.", "The for-profit contractor also had costs disallowed for expenditures that supported TANF-funded activities involving a popular entertainer who had formerly received welfare benefits. The contractor believed the activity would provide an innovative, motivational opportunity for TANF recipients. While the contractor claimed that Wisconsin officials had not provided sufficient guidance about allowable activities, state officials subsequently found the costs associated with the entertainment activities to be unallowable. Costs incurred by the for-profit contractor that state auditors cited as questionable included charges for a range of promotional advertising activities, restaurant and food purchases for which there was no documented business purpose, and flowers for which documentation was inadequate to justify a business purpose. Costs incurred by the nonprofit contractor that were cited as questionable included funds spent on advertising, restaurant meals and other food purchases that were not a program need, and local hotel charges for which there was inadequate documentation. At the time of our review, the contractors had repaid all unallowable and questionable costs.

At two of the eight sites\u2014 Milwaukee and Palm Beach\u2014all contractors met all specified performance levels. However, at five of the other sites, most contractors did not meet one or more of their performance levels, indicating that state and local governments did not achieve all anticipated performance levels by contracting for TANF services. Tables 4, 5, and 6 indicate the overall extent to which contractors met performance levels and the actual performance achieved by individual contractors with respect to measures for work participation, job placement, and job retention rates in each location that had established these performance levels. In contrast, at the two local sites that either established performance measures for the percentage of job placements that pay wages of at least a specified level (Milwaukee and Palm Beach) or offered health benefits (Milwaukee), all contractors met these measures.", "Payments to contractors at the eight localities that established performance levels are based either entirely or in part on whether contractors meet their specified performance levels. The measures most often used in the locations we visited mirror PRWORA\u2019s emphasis on helping TANF recipients obtain employment. The most common performance measures are work participation, job placement, and job retention rates. Work participation rates stipulate that contractors engage a specified percentage of TANF recipients in work-related activities such as job search or community work experience. Job placement rates specify that contractors place a specified percentage of recipients in jobs and job retention rates specify that contractors ensure that recipients retain employment (but not necessarily at the same job) for a specified period, typically ranging from 30 to 180 days. In addition, some localities have established performance levels that require contractors to place TANF recipients in certain types of jobs, such as jobs that pay wages of at least a specified level or offer health benefits.", "The localities varied in the types of measures and levels of performance they established. For example, the specified levels for job placements ranged from 22 percent of program participants in Palm Beach to 50 percent in Austin and Houston. Performance levels established for job retention also varied by jurisdiction. For example, the specified performance levels for contractors in Milwaukee County are that 75 percent of TANF recipients who entered employment retain employment for 30 days and 50 percent retain employment for 180 days. In comparison, contractors in San Diego County face a 90-percent level for 30-day employment retention and a 60-percent level for 180-day retention.", "In most cases, nonprofit and for-profit contractors had similar performance with respect to meeting the performance levels established for them. Across the locations we reviewed, there are 14 instances in which a local site had data on the comparable performance of nonprofit and for-profit contractors. In 11 of these instances, the percentages of nonprofit and for-profit contractors that met the measures were similar. In each of the remaining three instances, for-profit contractors performed substantially better overall.", "In two locations we reviewed\u2014Los Angeles County and San Diego County\u2014county governments also provided TANF services. Overall, the relative performance levels of county-provided services and contracted services were mixed. For example, in San Diego County, the county performed better than one for-profit contractor and worse than another for-profit contractor in meeting performance levels for certain job retention rates. In Los Angeles County, one of two for-profit contractors performed better than the county in placing TANF recipients in jobs while one of the two county providers achieved higher placement rates than the other for-profit contractor.", "At the remaining site, the District of Columbia, contracting officials were unable to provide information on how well TANF contractors met expected levels of performance. While the District has not established contractually specified performance levels for TANF contractors, these contractors do have performance-based contracts. For example, contractors receive a specified payment for each TANF recipient who becomes enrolled in work-related activities, placed in a job, or who retains employment for a certain period of time. However, District officials were unable to provide us with an assessment of TANF contractors\u2019 performance in serving TANF recipients."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The contracting out of TANF-funded services is an important area for several reasons. First, the magnitude of TANF contracting is substantial, involving at least $1.5 billion in federal and state funds in 2001, which represents at a minimum 13 percent of the total amount states expended for TANF programs (excluding expenditures for cash assistance). In 2001, about a quarter of the states contracted out 20 percent or more of the amounts they had expended for TANF programs in fiscal year 2000, ranging up to 74 percent. Second, PRWORA expanded the scope of services that could be contracted out to nongovernmental entities, such as determining eligibility for TANF. Third, some states are using new entities\u2014local workforce boards\u2014that procure TANF services and are responsible for overseeing TANF contractors.", "Problems with the performance of TANF contractors have been identified in some cases, but there is no clear pattern of a greater incidence of these problems with nonprofit versus for-profit contractors. At two of the nine localities we reviewed, auditors had disallowed certain costs by several contractors, and arrangements had been made for the contractors to repay unallowable costs. We found more widespread instances of contractors at the local sites not meeting their contractually established performance levels in areas such as work participation, job placement, and job retention rates. Contracting agencies at the local sites had established financial incentives for contractors by basing payments to contractors in whole or part on their performance in such areas. While meeting the service needs of TANF recipients can present many challenges for contractors, this has become even more important now that these recipients face time limits on the receipt of TANF.", "Effective oversight is critical to help ensure contractor accountability for the use of public funds, and our review identified problems in some cases with state and local oversight of TANF contractors. At the national level, our review of state single audit reports found internal control weaknesses for over a quarter of the states that potentially affected the states\u2019 ability to effectively monitor TANF contractors. The extent to which state single audits have identified problems with subrecipient monitoring involving TANF funds is generally equal to or greater than for several other social service programs in which contracting occurs with nongovernmental organizations. Moreover, in four of the six states we visited, independent audits have identified deficiencies in state or local oversight of TANF contractors. However, HHS officials told us that they do not know the extent and nature of problems pertaining to the oversight of TANF contractors that state single audit reports have cited because HHS does not analyze these reports in such a comprehensive manner. This is due, in part, to HHS\u2019s focus on those problems identified by single audit reports that involve unallowable or questionable costs. While such problems certainly warrant high priority, the result is that there is not adequate assurance that identified deficiencies pertaining to the monitoring of TANF contractors are being corrected in a strategic manner. Greater use of single audits as a program management tool by HHS would provide greater assurance that TANF contractors are being held accountable for the use of public funds. For example, HHS could use state audit reports more systematically in ways such as obtaining additional information about the extent to which nongovernmental TANF contractors are involved in the subrecipient monitoring deficiencies cited in these reports, identifying the most commonly reported types of deficiencies, and tracking how often the same deficiencies are cited recurrently for individual states."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To facilitate improved oversight of TANF contractors by all levels of government, we recommend that the Secretary of HHS direct the Assistant Secretary for Children and Families to use state single audit reports in a more systematic manner to identify the extent and nature of problems related to state oversight of nongovernmental TANF contractors and determine what additional actions may be appropriate to help prevent and correct such problems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["HHS provided written comments on a draft of this report, and these are reprinted in appendix IV. HHS said that the report addresses an important topic and provides useful information in describing the reasons that have prompted the rise in contracting, as well as the associated issues and challenges. However, HHS did not agree with our recommendation to the Assistant Secretary for Children and Families to use state single audit reports in a more systematic manner with regard to problems related to state oversight of nongovernmental TANF contractors. After evaluating HHS\u2019s comments, we continue to believe that our recommendation is warranted.", "HHS questioned whether our recommendation is consistent with the provisions of the Single Audit Act and whether the recommendation is necessary, in light of the current responsibilities that federal agencies and other units of government have for using single audit reports. HHS elaborated by explaining that OMB Circular A-133 requires federal agencies to take actions such as ensuring that audits of recipients of federal funds are completed and reports are received in a timely manner, issuing management decisions on audit findings within 6 months after receipt of the audit report, and ensuring that recipients take appropriate and timely corrective actions. HHS said that it performs such actions. HHS also said that Circular A-133 assigns these same responsibilities to other entities (e.g., state and local governments) for oversight of their subrecipients of federal funds. In addition, HHS said that there is some question about whether it is appropriate under the TANF statute, with its clear emphasis on state flexibility, for HHS to assume substantial new responsibilities that could interfere with states\u2019 methods of monitoring their subrecipients or contractors.", "We believe that our recommendation is consistent with the Single Audit Act, Circular A-133, and the TANF statute. Moreover, we view our recommendation as contributing to the stated objective of the Single Audit Act of ensuring that federal agencies use single audit reports to the maximum extent practicable in overseeing federal programs. In the TANF block grant environment, the rise in contracting brings with it new challenges at all levels of government regarding accountability for use of federal funds by nongovernmental entities. While states have a great deal of flexibility in using TANF funds, HHS continues to have a fiduciary responsibility to ensure that states properly account for their use of federal funds and maintain adequate internal controls over the use of funds by their subrecipients. HHS follow-up on individual state single audit reports does not preclude the agency from analyzing these reports in a more systematic manner to meet its oversight responsibilities, as we recommend. Furthermore, our recommendation does not call for HHS to usurp any oversight responsibilities from the states for overseeing their subrecipients.", "Finally, HHS said that it failed to recognize what value our recommendation would add to the TANF program. HHS said that because its staffing level for administering TANF has been greatly reduced, the value and cost-benefit of our recommendation must be considered before adding or redirecting staff to gain a comprehensive perspective on the extent and nature of problems with the monitoring of subrecipients and contractors. In response, we believe that implementing our recommendation could strengthen HHS\u2019s oversight of this important area and facilitate improved oversight of TANF contractors by states. For example, more systematic analysis of state single audit reports by HHS could help identify national patterns in the problems with states\u2019 monitoring of their TANF subrecipients cited by these reports. This information would be valuable to states working to improve their oversight of these subrecipients. Moreover, users of single audit reports can now analyze information more quickly than ever before by using the Internet to access a single audit database established by the Bureau of the Census. In addition, more systematic analysis by HHS of the subrecipient monitoring problems reported by state single audits could also provide useful information on the extent to which these problems involve nongovernmental contractors and are recurring in the same states. Such information could help HHS ascertain whether or not this is a growing problem area that may warrant closer scrutiny. By disseminating the results of its analysis of single audit reports to states through existing venues such as audit forums and conferences with state TANF officials, HHS could share information with its TANF partners to facilitate better oversight of contractor-provided services.", "In addition, we believe that our recommendation represents a cost- effective approach to improving oversight of TANF contractors because the recommendation involves making fuller use of information that is already collected. The national analysis of state single audit reports that we performed for this report took less than a month and involved using the single audit database to identify reports that cited problems with TANF subrecipient monitoring, reviewing these reports to extract the specific problems, and identifying some of the most commonly cited problems. It may be possible for HHS regional office staff to perform some of this type of analysis, as well as to obtain any needed additional information about specific problems, in the course of their current reviews of state single audit reports for their regions. Such an approach could reduce the amount of analysis by HHS headquarters staff needed to obtain a comprehensive perspective on the extent and nature of problems related to state oversight of TANF contractors.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of HHS and the department\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Children and Families, appropriate congressional committees, and other interested parties.

For these 13 states, a second survey instrument, which requested data on contracts entered into at the local level, was sent to 10 counties that receive the largest TANF allocations in each of these 13 states to determine how much contracting takes place in their larger counties. The third survey instrument, which requested data on state-level and local-level contracts, was sent to the remaining 37 states and the District of Columbia (see app. II for this survey instrument). All three survey instruments were pretested with appropriate respondents in six states.
