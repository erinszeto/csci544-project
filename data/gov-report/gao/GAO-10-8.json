The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for ensuring that critical telecommunications infrastructure is protected. GAO was asked to examine a pandemic's impact on Internet congestion and what actions can be and are being taken to address it, the adequacy of securities market organizations' pandemic plans, and the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) oversight of these efforts.

Private Internet providers have limited ability to prioritize traffic or take other actions that could assist critical teleworkers. Some actions, such as reducing customers' transmission speeds or blocking popular Web sites, could negatively impact e-commerce and require government authorization. However, DHS has not developed a strategy to address potential Internet congestion or worked with federal partners to ensure that sufficient authorities to act exist. It also has not assessed the feasibility of conducting a campaign to obtain public cooperation to reduce nonessential Internet use to relieve congestion. DHS also has not begun coordinating with other federal and private sector entities to assess other actions that could be taken or determine what authorities may be needed to act. Because the key securities exchanges and clearing organizations generally use proprietary networks that bypass the public Internet, their ability to execute and process trades should not be affected by any congestion. In analyzing seven critical market organizations, GAO found they had prepared pandemic plans that addressed key regulatory elements, including hygiene programs to minimize staff illness and continuing operations by spreading staff across geographic areas. However, not all had completed or documented analyses of whether they would have sufficient staff capable of carrying out critical activities if many of their employees were ill. Also, not all had developed alternatives to teleworking if congestion arises. SEC staff have been regularly examining market organizations' readiness, but could further reduce risk of disruptions by ensuring that these organizations prepare complete staffing analyses and teleworking alternatives."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The outbreak of the H1N1 flu in April 2009, while not as severe as initially  expected, has underscored the concerns that a potentially serious virus  could emerge that would cause widespread illness and deaths.

The impact of such an event on various  sectors of the U.S. economy could also be significant. In a severe  pandemic, governments may close schools, shut down public  transportation systems, and ban public gatherings such as concerts or  sporting events. In such scenarios, many more people than usual may be at  home during the day, and Internet use in residential neighborhoods could  increase significantly as a result of people seeking news, entertainment, or  social contact from home computers. Concerns have been raised that this  additional traffic could lead to congestion on the Internet that would  significantly affect businesses in local neighborhoods, such as small  doctors\u2019 offices or business employees attempting to telework by  connecting to their employers\u2019 enterprise networks.", "Among the organizations that could be affected by potential pandemic- related Internet congestion are those participating in the U.S. securities  markets. For these markets to function, various organizations must be able  to operate, including the exchanges or electronic trading venues that  execute the orders received from broker-dealers. After trades are  executed, a clearing organization processes the information to verify the  accuracy of the transaction and to transfer ownership of the securities  from the seller to the buyer. Payments are also transferred among the  banks used by clearing organizations and broker-dealers by various  payment processors.

Such strains can be highly pathogenic because there  is little or no pre-existing immunity in the population. Some of the issues  associated with the preparation for and responses to an influenza  pandemic are similar to those for any other type of disaster or hazard.  However, a pandemic poses some unique challenges. Unlike incidents that  are discretely bounded in space or time (e.g., most natural or man-made  disasters), an influenza pandemic is an event likely to come in waves, each  lasting weeks, months, or years, and pass through communities of all sizes  across the nation and the world. While a pandemic will not directly  damage physical infrastructure such as power lines or computer systems,  it could threaten critical systems by potentially removing the essential  personnel needed to operate them from the workplace for weeks or  months. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have said that in a severe  pandemic, the absences of those who are ill, taking care of ill family  members, and fearing infection could reach a projected 40 percent during  the peak weeks of a community outbreak, with lower rates of absence  during the weeks before and after the peak. In addition, an influenza  pandemic could result in 200,000 to 2 million deaths in the United States,  depending on its severity. Although representing a novel strain of flu, the  H1N1 outbreak, first detected in the United States around April 2009, has  caused illness ranging from mild to severe. While most people who have  been sick have recovered without needing medical treatment,  hospitalizations and deaths from infection with this virus have occurred,  and recent CDC news bulletins have indicated the second wave of the  disease potentially could be more severe, especially for children and other  at-risk groups.", "As with most disasters, the initial governmental response to a pandemic  will be at the state and local level and will aim to decrease people\u2019s  exposure to the virus. Initial responses may include encouraging and  facilitating good hand hygiene, requiring ill individuals to isolate  themselves, educating people about conditions that put them at high risk  for complications, encouraging early treatment, and encouraging creative  solutions to increase the distance between people at school and work.  Under conditions of increased severity of illness, government response  could escalate to include more aggressive actions such as closing schools,  shutting down public transportation, and prohibiting large public  gatherings at venues such as sporting events. These measures are intended  to create \u201csocial distance\u201d between people to prevent large numbers of  people coming into direct contact in an attempt to minimize transmission  of the disease. Similarly, individual organizations are also advised to  increase the distance between people in workplaces.

After a securities trade is executed, it undergoes clearance and  settlement to verify the accuracy of the transaction. Ownership of the  securities is then transferred from the seller to the buyer, and the  necessary payment between the two parties is exchanged. Separate  organizations complete the clearance and settlement process for stocks  and for options. In general, a clearing organization collects and compares  trade information to ensure the accuracy of the trade and calculates the  amounts that are to be exchanged between parties. A depository  organization then transfers ownership and maintains the records of  securities held by broker-dealers and investors. To facilitate these  interactions, the large broker-dealers have accounts directly with the  clearing organizations, while smaller and independent broker-dealers act  as introducing firms by sending their customers\u2019 orders to an intermediary  broker-dealer, known as a clearing firm, that accepts and processes the  trades and clears and settles these trades with the central clearing  organization.

For example, all  these organizations had developed the capability to perform their critical  functions at alternate sites geographically dispersed from their primary  sites. They all also had improved their physical and information security  measures. The broker-dealers and clearing services banks that account for  significant trading volumes had also taken steps to increase the distances  between their sites for primary and backup operations for clearance and  settlement activities and established dispersed backup trading locations.", "Market participants have also worked with financial regulators and other  organizations on other efforts to improve the overall resiliency of the  financial sector; these include periodically conducting industry-wide  connectivity testing from backup locations. Coordinated by the Securities  Industry and Financial Markets Association and other groups, these tests  verify the ability of market participants to operate through an emergency  using backup sites, recovery facilities, and backup communications  capabilities across the industry; and to provide participants with an  opportunity to exercise and check the ability of their backup sites to  successfully transmit and receive communications between the backup  sites of other market participants.

For example, localities may choose to close schools and these students,  confined at home, will likely look to the Internet for entertainment,  including downloading or \u201cstreaming\u201d videos, playing online games, and  engaging in potential activities that may consume large amounts of  network capacity (bandwidth). Additionally, people who are ill or are  caring for sick family members will be at home and could add to Internet  traffic by accessing online sites for health, news, and other information.  This increased and sustained recreational or other use by the general  public during a pandemic outbreak will likely lead to a significant increase  in traffic on residential networks. If theaters, sporting events, or other  public gatherings are curtailed, use of the Internet for entertainment and  information is likely to increase even more. Furthermore, the government  has recommended teleworking as an option for businesses to keep  operations running during a pandemic. Thus, many workers will be  working from home, competing with recreational and other users for  bandwidth.", "According to a DHS study and Internet providers, this additional  pandemic-related traffic is likely to exceed the capacity of Internet  providers\u2019 network infrastructure in metropolitan residential Internet  access networks. Residential Internet users typically connect their  computers to their Internet service providers\u2019 network through a modem  or similar Internet access device. These Internet access devices route  home users\u2019 traffic to a network device that aggregates it with that of other  users before forwarding it to the other parts of the provider\u2019s network and  its ultimate destination on the Internet. As shown in figure 3, the traffic  aggregating device differs depending on the technology used for Internet  access\u2014DSL, a cable network, or other means. But all these technologies  use network architectures that basically aggregate the traffic of multiple  users on a single device that then routes it to other parts of the providers\u2019  networks. For example, within a DSL network architecture, the user\u2019s  traffic travels on a dedicated pair of copper wires from a home computer  to the provider\u2019s location\u2014usually known as a central office\u2014which  houses a device called the digital subscriber line access multiplexer  (DSLAM). The DSLAM aggregates this traffic and that of other users of this  provider from individual residential neighborhoods before sending it on to  regional networks and eventually to the national Internet backbone.  Traffic from home users who connect to the Internet through a cable  provider moves from the home computer over coaxial cables and fiber  optic cables then ultimately to a network device known as a cable modem  termination system (CMTS). The CMTS also aggregates this traffic with  that of other users from other individual residential neighborhoods and  sends it to the regional networks and the national Internet backbone.  During a pandemic, congestion is most likely to occur in the traffic to or  from the aggregation devices that serve residential neighborhoods,  interfering with teleworkers\u2019 and others\u2019 ability to use the Internet.", "Congestion affecting home users is likely to occur because the parts of  providers\u2019 DSL, cable, satellite, and other types of networks that provide  access to the Internet from residential neighborhoods are not designed to  carry all the potential traffic that users could generate in a particular  neighborhood or that all connect to a particular aggregating device for  efficiency and cost reasons. Providers do not build networks to handle 100  percent of the total traffic that could be generated because users are  neither active on the network all at the same time, nor are they sending  maximum traffic at all times. Instead, providers use statistical models  based upon past users\u2019 patterns and projected growth to estimate the  likely peak load of traffic that could occur and then design and build  networks based on the results of the statistical model to accommodate at  least this level. According to one provider, this engineering method serves  to optimize available capacity for all users. For example, under a cable  architecture, 200 to 500 individual cable modems may be connected to a  provider\u2019s CMTS, depending on average usage in an area. Although each of  these individual modems may be capable of receiving up to 7 or 8 megabits  per second (Mbps) of incoming information, the CMTS can transmit a  maximum of only about 38 Mbps. Providers\u2019 staff told us that building the  residential parts of networks to be capable of handling 100 percent of the  traffic that all users could potentially generate would be prohibitively  expensive.", "A 2007 DHS study that was conducted in cooperation with various  government, communication sector, and financial sector entities used  modeling of residential and other network configurations to confirm that  the increased traffic generated in neighborhoods during a severe pandemic  is likely to exceed the capacity of the providers\u2019 aggregation devices in  metropolitan residential neighborhoods. The study examined the  technical feasibility of the pandemic telecommuting strategy advocated by  the government. The study also focused on identifying action plans to  better prepare the nation for telecommuting during an influenza pandemic.  As part of the study, a model was developed using data and assumptions  from a large U.S. metropolitan area to represent a typical Internet  provider\u2019s network configuration, including devices and network  capacities. For cost reasons, the study used DSL network architecture for  the purposes of the congestion modeling, but the preparers acknowledged  that other means of accessing the Internet had similar architectures and  thus the impact of a pandemic would be similar. The contractors that  prepared the study simulated Internet traffic in amounts that  corresponded to the level of Internet use in a residential neighborhood  under three scenarios of pandemic severity\u201420, 40, and 90 percent  absenteeism from the workplace. The study\u2019s model predicted that at the  40 percent absenteeism level\u2014the level that health organizations have  indicated is likely under a relatively serious pandemic\u2014the highest point  of congestion across the entire Internet infrastructure could occur within  residential Internet access networks. Specifically, at the 40 percent  absenteeism level, the study predicted that most users within residential  neighborhoods would likely experience congestion when attempting to  use the Internet. Based on our assessment of the study, we concluded that  the methodology applied and the likely congestion points identified were  reasonable. Furthermore, communication sector representatives we  interviewed confirmed the likelihood of Internet congestion between a  user\u2019s home and the point at which that traffic combines with other users  at the providers\u2019 aggregation devices. Although this study assessed the  impact on a large city, the severity of congestion could vary across  neighborhoods or nationally depending on the capacities of residential  neighborhood Internet access networks, with cities or areas with larger  populations and higher incomes generally having large broadband  capacities and less-populated rural or poorer areas possibly having less  broadband capacity. However, the study used typical telecommunications  network configurations for a large U.S. city and found that congestion was  likely. As a result, we believe that its findings mean that most other  locations in the United States could experience similar problems.", "Although predicting that the most severe congestion would occur within  residential access networks, the study overseen by DHS also noted that  pandemic-related congestion was possible in other parts of the networks  that comprise the Internet. For example, users could experience  congestion at the point at which traffic is transferred between service  providers because of potential differences in transmission capacity.  Additionally, teleworkers connecting to their companies\u2019 networks (the  \u201centerprise\u201d networks) could overload various components of these  networks, such as the devices that provide security\u2014firewalls\u2014or servers  that provide access to various applications because some businesses\u2019  networks may not have scaled these devices to accommodate the  anticipated increase in telecommuting traffic during a pandemic. The steps  being taken by financial organizations to ensure their enterprise networks  are prepared for pandemic levels of use are discussed later in this report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Providers\u2019 Options for Reducing Internet Congestion Are Limited and Could Require Government Action", "paragraphs": ["Providers\u2019 options for addressing expected pandemic-related Internet  congestion include providing extra capacity, using network management  controls, installing direct lines to organizations, temporarily reducing the  maximum transmission rate, and shutting down some Internet sites. Each  of these methods is limited either by technical difficulties or questions of  authority. In the normal course of business, providers attempt to address  congestion in particular neighborhoods by building out additional  infrastructure\u2014for example, by adding new or expanding lines and cables.  Internet provider staff told us that providers determine how much to  invest in expanding network infrastructure based on business  expectations. If they determine that a demand for increased capacity  exists that can profitably be met, they may choose to invest to increase  network capacity in large increments using a variety of methods such as  replacing old equipment and increasing the number of devices serving  particular neighborhoods. Providers will not attempt to increase network  capacity to meet the increased demand resulting from a pandemic, as no  one knows when a pandemic outbreak is likely to occur or which  neighborhoods would experience congestion. Staff at Internet providers  whom we interviewed said they monitor capacity usage constantly and try  to run their networks between 40 and 80 percent capacity at peak hours.  They added that in the normal course of business, their companies begin  the process to expand capacity when a certain utilization threshold is  reached, generally 70 to 80 percent of full capacity over a sustained period  of time at peak hours.", "However, during a pandemic, providers are not likely to be able to address  congestion by physically expanding capacity in residential neighborhoods  for several reasons. First, building out infrastructure can be very costly  and takes time to complete. For example, one provider we spoke with said  that it had spent billions of dollars building out infrastructure across the  nation over time, and adding capacity to large areas quickly is likely not  possible. Second, another provider told us that increasing network  capacity requires the physical presence of technicians and advance  planning, including preordering the necessary equipment from suppliers or  manufacturers. The process can take anywhere from 6 to 8 weeks from the  time the order is placed to actual installation. According to this provider, a  major constraint to increasing capacity is the number of technicians the  firm has available to install the equipment. In addition to the cost and time  associated with expanding capacity, during a pandemic outbreak  providers may also experience high absenteeism due to staff illnesses, and  thus might not have enough staff to upgrade network capacities. Providers  said they would, out of necessity, refrain from provisioning new  residential services if their staff were reduced significantly during a  pandemic. Instead, they would focus on ensuring services for the federal  government priority communication programs and performing network  management techniques to re-route traffic around congested areas in  regional networks or the national backbone. However, these activities  would likely not relieve congestion in the residential Internet access  networks.", "Providing critical employees direct connections that bypass residential  congestion may be another option for facilitating telework during a  pandemic, but this option can be cost prohibitive to employers and is not  widely used. Specifically, some providers offer network solutions such as  private lines to businesses and governments. Private line services allow  businesses to run their corporate networks and applications separately  from public Internet traffic and could provide a point-to-point dedicated  path between teleworkers\u2019 homes and offices, bypassing the residential  neighborhood congestion points. However, according to provider staff we  spoke with, installing private lines in a residence requires advance  planning and is expensive. One provider noted that a direct connection is  not a solution that can be invoked when the pandemic strikes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Technically Feasible Options Would Likely Require a Government Directive", "paragraphs": ["In the current network environment, providers\u2019 capability to address  pandemic-related Internet congestion by prioritizing certain users\u2019 traffic,  including that of financial sector teleworkers, is limited. Specifically,  provider systems are not designed to identify and provide priority to  individual users when traffic is routed over the Internet and multiple  networks are used for the connection. Furthermore, Internet providers\u2019  networks also are not currently designed to identify particular types of  customers connected to the Internet. For example, the networks cannot  distinguish between critical employees teleworking and recreational users.", "Providers identified one technically feasible alternative that has the  potential to reduce Internet congestion during a pandemic, but raised  concerns that it could violate customer service agreements and thus would  require a directive from the government to implement. Although providers  cannot identify users at the computer level to manage traffic from that  point, two providers stated that if the residential Internet access network  in a particular neighborhood was experiencing congestion, a provider  could attempt to reduce congestion by reducing the amount of traffic that  each user could send to and receive from his or her network. Such a  reduction would require adjusting the configuration file within each  customer\u2019s modem to temporarily reduce the maximum transmission  speed that that modem was capable of performing\u2014for example, by  reducing its incoming capability from 7 Mbps to 1 Mbps. However,  according to providers we spoke with, such reductions could violate the  agreed-upon levels of services for which customers have paid. Therefore,  under current agreements, two providers indicated they would need a  directive from the government to take such actions.", "Shutting down specific Internet sites would also reduce congestion,  although many we spoke with expressed concerns about the feasibility of  such an approach. Overall Internet congestion could be reduced if Web  sites that accounted for significant amounts of traffic\u2014such as those with  video streaming\u2014were shut down during a pandemic. According to one  recently issued study, the number of adults who watch videos on video- sharing sites has nearly doubled since 2006, far outpacing the growth of  many other Internet activities. However, most providers\u2019 staff told us that  blocking users from accessing such sites, while technically possible,  would be very difficult and, in their view, would not address the  congestion problem and would require a directive from the government.  One provider indicated that such blocking would be difficult because  determining which sites should be blocked would be a very subjective  process. Additionally, this provider noted that technologically savvy site  operators could change their Internet protocol addresses, allowing users  to access the site regardless. Another provider told us that some of these  large bandwidth sites stream critical news information. Furthermore,  some state, local, and federal government offices and agencies, including  DHS, currently use or have plans to increase their use of social media Web  sites and to use video streaming as a means to communicate with the  public. Shutting down such sites without affecting pertinent information  would be a challenge for providers and could create more Internet  congestion as users would repeatedly try to access these sites. According  to one provider, two added complications are the potential liability  resulting from lawsuits filed by businesses that lose revenue when their  sites are shutdown or restricted and potential claims of anticompetitive  practices, denial of free speech, or both. Some providers said that the  operators of specific Internet sites could shut down their respective sites  with less disruption and more effectively than Internet providers, and  suggested that a better course of action would be for the government to  work directly with the site operators."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Capabilities to Prioritize Traffic or Expand Capacities May Be Available in the Future", "paragraphs": ["Providers could help reduce the potential for a pandemic to cause Internet  congestion by ongoing expansions of their networks\u2019 capacities.

In addition to cable network upgrades, at least one  telecommunications provider is offering fiber-to-the home, which is a  broadband service operating over a fiber-optic communications network.  Specifically, fiber-to-the-home Internet service is designed to provide  Internet access with connection speeds ranging from 10 Mbps to 50 Mbps.", "Although not generally feasible in the current environment, the ability to  prioritize individual user\u2019s traffic is envisioned to be technically possible in  future upgrades of the infrastructure of the Internet and  telecommunications networks, but such capabilities are estimated to be  years away. As we recently reported, DHS is working with international  standards bodies to help develop standards that could allow greater  flexibility to prioritize data communications in the future; this effort is a  part of what is referred to as the Next Generation Networks. However,  these capabilities are not expected to be ready for several years due to the  complexity of the systems and the need to develop standards that work  across varying providers\u2019 infrastructures, including internationally. In  addition, we reported DHS had difficulty getting its full budgets approved,  which may have contributed to the delay in developing standards.

Under HSPD-7 and the National  Strategy to Secure Cyberspace, DHS is the lead agency for coordinating  the protection of critical assets in the communications sector from  attacks. Also under these authorities, DHS is responsible for facilitating a  public-private response to the recovery from major Internet disruption.  In addition to being a focal point to the cyber-critical infrastructure  protection effort, DHS has been designated as one of two federal agencies  responsible for coordinating the United States\u2019 pandemic response. As  specified in the Implementation Plan for the National Strategy for  Pandemic Influenza, DHS is to coordinate the nation\u2019s response in  conjunction with HHS.", "DHS has undertaken several pandemic planning activities. As discussed  earlier in this report, DHS and representatives from the government,  communications sector, and financial sector conducted a study to assess  specifically the technical feasibility of the pandemic telecommuting  strategy and identify ways for the nation to better prepare to support the  strategy. In coordination with interagency partners and the critical  infrastructure sector coordinating councils, DHS has completed individual  sector-specific pandemic guidelines and provided Webinars to sector  partners on their respective plans. These guidelines are intended to assist  the sectors and businesses with the sectors\u2019 plan for a severe influenza  pandemic, and include some consideration of potential Internet  congestion. For example, the guidelines for the information technology  and communications sectors recommend that entities in these sectors  consider advising employees to limit household use of streaming video or  other bandwidth-intensive Internet activities. The guidelines also  recommend consideration of obtaining multiple means of accessing the  Internet. The guidelines have been provided to the sector coordinating  councils via a secure DHS information portal, as well as to the members of  the National Governor\u2019s Association. DHS officials told us that some of the  sectors have made the guidelines available to the public. More recently,  DHS completed the DHS 2009-H1N1 Implementation Plan, which  provides planning guidance for DHS and identifies specific roles and  responsibilities for the DHS components such as the Office of Policy or the  Transportation Security Administration. According to DHS officials, the  plan also directs all DHS components to develop plans that address key  preparation and response actions, performance of mission essential  functions, workforce protection, continuity of operations, and  communications with key stakeholders during the H1N1 influenza  pandemic.", "However, while these planning activities are designed to help government  and private sector partners prepare for a pandemic, they are limited in  addressing the anticipated Internet congestion. Although serving as the  coordinating agency for Internet recovery and pandemic response, DHS  staff told us that their agency does not have a strategy to address Internet  congestion. According to DHS staff, their agency has not begun developing  such a strategy because since the September 11 terrorist attacks, they have  had other crises such as Hurricane Katrina to address. A senior official at a  financial markets regulator told us that leadership by the government had  been lacking in addressing this potential risk to the financial sector.  Without action by DHS to address this potential congestion, employees in  critical sectors of the nation\u2019s economy, including those in financial  services, might not be able to effectively telework or otherwise  communicate or transmit data over the Internet.", "In addition, although various federal and private sector organizations  would likely be required to coordinate an effective Internet congestion  response strategy, DHS has neither reached out nor coordinated with  other partners, such as other federal or state agencies with  telecommunications oversight authorities, to prepare such a strategy. As  we previously reported, the experience of Hurricane Katrina showed the  need to improve leadership at all levels of government in order to better  respond to a catastrophic disaster. As part of this, the legal authorities,  roles and responsibilities, and lines of authority at all levels of government  must be clearly defined, effectively communicated, and well understood in  order to facilitate rapid and effective decision making. In order to respond  effectively to pandemic-related Internet congestion, DHS will need to  effectively plan and work with other parts of the federal government and  possibly state and local governments and the private sector in its efforts.  Other organizations that could be relevant include FCC, which, as  previously noted, is charged with regulating interstate and international  communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. DHS staff  representing the Office of Policy acknowledged that such coordination  would be necessary to address Internet congestion effectively and ensure  that the various parts of the federal government are not conducting  conflicting activities. For example, the staff told us the Department of  Education was hoping to have schools use the Internet during a pandemic  to allow students to access remote learning courses if schools were  closed. The staff acknowledged that, as a result, DHS would have to  coordinate with the other relevant agencies to ensure that their various  actions are appropriately taken into account in developing a congestion  plan. According to DHS staff, DHS has engaged in dialogues with other  agencies about pandemic-related issues on a regular basis. Agency staff  once again cited time constraints and the need to focus on other crises as  reasons for not having discussed the development of a coordinated  strategy for addressing Internet congestion. However, unless DHS starts  coordinating with other federal, state, and even private sector parties on  possible Internet congestion solutions, there may not be sufficient time to  develop a coordinated strategy to address a rapidly emerging severe  pandemic.", "Further, although an effective congestion response strategy could require  directing the private sector entities that operate the Internet\u2019s  infrastructure today to take actions that could negatively affect users, DHS  has not determined whether it or other agencies have the necessary  authorities to require providers to take such actions. We previously  reported that the authorities of federal government agencies regarding the  Internet were unclear. Given the importance of the Internet  infrastructure to our nation\u2019s communications and commerce, we  suggested that Congress consider clarifying the legal framework guiding  Internet recovery. Although DHS staff identified a list of potential  authorities that may or may not apply, they told us they were not able to  specify whether their agency had clear or specific authority to require  telecommunications providers to take actions to address congestion, such  as reducing customer transmission speeds or blocking entertainment Web  sites. Instead, DHS\u2019s approach would be to assess the authorities as part o the development of any such strategy. While this approach could help DH determine at some point if it or some other relevant federal agency had  adequate authority to address potential Internet congestion, it would  increase the risk that the federal government will not be able to respond  rapidly or effectively if a pandemic quickly emerges.", "Other federal government agencies might have authority to direct  providers to take certain actions during a pandemic, but whether these are  adequate is uncertain. Under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended  (the Act), FCC has authority to regulate the telecommunications providers  specifically and has authority generally with respect to interstate and  foreign communication by wire and radio. According to FCC staff, there  may be actions the FCC could take regarding the Internet to address  threats to national security or public safety. However, in commenting on a  draft of this report, FCC officials noted that there is an ongoing court  challenge to FCC\u2019s authority regarding the Internet. In addition, FCC staff  were not sure whether FCC would have sufficient authority to require  private sector organizations to take all actions that may be deemed  necessary in an emergency situation to relieve congestion and facilitate  commerce, including teleworking by financial sector employees. As part of  preparing a national broadband access plan, FCC has recently sought  public comments on options for prioritizing Internet traffic in a  pandemic. According to FCC staff, very few comment letters addressed  the prioritization issue. Based on our review, some service providers  expressed interest in the government considering including a prioritization  scheme in the plan. Additionally, one provider suggested the plan should  give providers flexibility to actively manage networks during a pandemic.  Finally, one financial sector organization noted that the plan should  include a prioritization scheme to prioritize Internet traffic based on how  critical it is to national and economic security.", "Some observers have suggested that an authority granted to the President  in the Communications Act of 1934 could conceivably be used to take  actions to address Internet congestion during a pandemic. In their view,  the President may have, under certain limited circumstances involving a  state or threat of war, the power to authorize government control of the  telecommunications systems and, if properly invoked and delegated, this  might broadly provide authority for the government to require private  sector entities to take actions intended to address congestion. However,  according to FCC staff we spoke with, while the authority under the Act  may grant the President powers over telecommunication systems during  wartime, they did not know whether such powers could be exercised in a  pandemic. However, until DHS, as the lead agency responsible for  coordinating protection of telecommunications, including the Internet,  takes action to work with other agencies to assess whether sufficient  authorities exist to direct necessary actions by the private sector, the  potential for a timely and effective federal response to congestion is  reduced."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Voluntary Reductions in Internet Use May Be an Effective Response to Congestion, but DHS Has Not Taken Steps to Encourage It", "paragraphs": ["Although its own study identified voluntary public reduction of Internet  use as an effective means of reducing pandemic congestion, DHS has not  begun steps to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of obtaining such  public cooperation. According to the DHS study and to providers and  others we spoke with, voluntary actions taken by the general public could  have significant potential to reduce the surges in traffic loads that  residential users may experience during a pandemic. For example, the  general public could be asked to limit video streaming, gaming, and peer- to-peer and other bandwidth-intensive applications during daytime work  hours. They could also be encouraged to use broadcast news sources in  place of online news. A similar campaign developed by another agency\u2014 HHS\u2014to publicize pandemic awareness strategies showed that such  public education efforts can require months to prepare and cost millions  of dollars to test and implement. For example, as part of creating various  radio and television messages to provide information to the public about  how to prepare for a pandemic, HHS conducted market research using  various techniques, including focus groups, to gauge the public\u2019s opinion  about a pandemic. In 2005-2006, when they began this effort, HHS staff  stated that it took the agency about 6 months to develop the public service  announcements (PSA). In 2006-2007 HHS staff spent about 4 months  planning and producing PSAs. The cost of running radio PSAs in 137 cities  over an 11-month period in 2007 was about $1.5 million dollars.", "DHS staff acknowledged that such a campaign would also require  cooperation and coordination among multiple federal and other agencies  to be effective and avoid conflicting goals and activities. For example,  agencies would need to work together to ensure that some were not  planning to recommend increased use of the Internet to provide  information, education, or for other purposes during a pandemic. For  example, HHS may advocate using the Internet to maintain social ties  during a pandemic, which would make the goal of easing congestion by  staying off-line more challenging. However, DHS staff told us they had not  begun efforts to evaluate the feasibility or effectiveness of such a  campaign or taken steps to begin developing such an effort because other  activities supporting its operational mission have taken priority.

Health authorities, including WHO and CDC, have  issued phased timelines that track the progress of a pandemic from  earliest detection to widespread global illness. Because being able to  operate effectively at the height of a pandemic could require an  organization to have taken steps in advance, an effective pandemic plan  should contain more and stronger measures that would be taken as the  phases of the pandemic progress. Such a strategy provides sufficient time  to take steps that require more planning or lead time, such as purchasing  needed supplies or conducting training in advance of the actual pandemic.  Gradually implementing responses as the pandemic progresses also could  prevent organizations from generating undue expenses if what appears to  be a pandemic early on does not turn out to be one that significantly  disrupts operations.", "Our analysis of the seven critical organizations\u2019 pandemic plans showed  that each included activities that escalated as the pandemic progressed.  All the organizations are currently monitoring the information regarding  the potential spread of viruses that could lead to a pandemic through the  CDC or WHO Web sites and communicate closely with local authorities,  such as the New York City Office of Emergency Management. In the early  stages of a pandemic these organizations would take preventive actions,  such as monitoring the world pandemic situation and creating awareness  of wellness practices before widespread outbreaks begin (i.e., WHO  Phases 1 through 3). But as the pandemic levels advance, the  organizations\u2019 plans generally call for them to implement more extensive  responses, such as relocating staff to increase social distancing or sending  some staff home to telework. For example, one organization\u2019s pandemic  plan describes efforts to impose business travel restrictions; prepare  additional communications to employees, customers, and regulatory  bodies; and stock up on additional critical supplies during WHO Phase 4 in  case a pandemic disrupts supply chains. As the alert level rises to Phase 5,  the plan escalates the actions to initiate daily absenteeism tracking,  expand the deployment of hand-sanitizing gel, and do additional facility  cleaning. When WHO declares a pandemic (i.e., WHO Phase 6), the  organizations will take steps to implement social distancing, such as  sending a number of employees to the backup facility and designating  people to work from home. All of the plans follow this general design, and  during the H1N1 outbreak, all the organizations began implementing some  of these steps. In particular, as the alert level escalated from WHO Phase 4  to Phase 5 in April of 2009, several organizations communicated to staff on  additional measures they were taking, which included placing more hand  sanitizers in the workplace and cleaning facilities more often. As WHO  raised its pandemic phase further to the highest level (i.e., WHO Phase 6),  indicating that a broad outbreak of an influenza epidemic was believed to  be imminent, organizations, according to SEC staff, were prepared to take  further steps that correspond with an outbreak\u2014such as performing  medical screenings of staff reporting to work\u2014although such measures  ultimately were not necessary due to the milder nature of the H1N1  outbreak here in the United States.", "As a result of their experiences with the recent H1N1 flu outbreak, some  market organizations and financial regulators told us they were  considering developing modified trigger points in the plans that might not  follow the WHO designations exactly. Officials from these organization  said they had made this decision because of their experience with the  relatively benign nature of the H1N1 virus in the United States. The health  authorities\u2019 pandemic phases were designed for a disease that causes high  levels of severe illness, and even deaths, like some of the previous flu  pandemics have caused. However, even though the United States  continues to report the largest number of novel H1N1 cases of any country  worldwide, most people who have become ill in 2009 have recovered  without requiring medical treatment. As a result, staff from several of the  critical market organizations did not need to fully implement their plans at  that time because their employees were not seriously ill, if at all, and the  plans could be modified to adapt to such a scenario.", "Our analysis indicated that all seven critical organizations also had fully  addressed another key element of pandemic planning by instituting  preventive programs intended to reduce the impact of a pandemic on their  organizations. Because an organization has a much greater chance of  continuing operations during a pandemic if fewer of its employees are ill,  an effective pandemic plan should include a preventive program to reduce  the likelihood of employees becoming sick. The steps the organizations  took included providing information and educational campaigns to keep  employees informed of pandemic news and developments. For example,  during the recent H1N1 outbreak, staff at these seven organizations  developed memos to employees on the status of the outbreak and steps  the organizations were taking based on news and briefings from the  federal, state, and local authorities. Further, all the organizations have  developed internal Web sites to educate employees on general information  on preventing spread of disease, including hand-washing techniques and  coughing etiquette and provided personal hygiene items such as hand  sanitizers and masks. In addition, three of the organizations prepared  extensive education outreach campaigns (e.g., hand-washing awareness  week) shortly after the financial regulators\u2019 pandemic planning  requirements were issued, in mid-2007. Most of the organizations have also  developed policies regarding restricting travel as a way to reduce illness  among their employees. For example, the organizations\u2019 plans typically  called for curtailing international travel at WHO Phase 4, and some  required staff returning from abroad to quarantine themselves for a period,  such as 7 days, to lower the chance of spreading illness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Critical Organizations Reviewed Have Plans to Continue Operations with High Absenteeism, but Some Have Limitations in Their Staffing Plans and Teleworking Alternatives", "paragraphs": ["All seven critical securities market organizations we reviewed have  developed plans with procedures intended to allow them to continue the  functions critical to their operations despite high levels of absenteeism,  but not all have fully analyzed or thoroughly documented their staffing  levels or developed formal alternatives if teleworking proves unfeasible  due to Internet congestion. Although congestion during a pandemic could  interfere with individuals\u2019 ability, including teleworkers and others, to  access the Internet, the primary communications of the critical markets  organizations would not be affected because these organizations and their  participants communicate via high-capacity, proprietary networks that do  not traverse the public Internet infrastructure. According to the health  authorities, one of the most significant challenges of a pandemic will be  staffing shortages due to absenteeism caused by employees either too ill to  work, taking care of ill family members, or afraid to come to work because  of the chance of infection. Unfortunately, organizations could also  permanently lose critical staff if the pandemic causes significant levels of  deaths. Therefore, a responsive pandemic plan should include procedures  for ensuring that an organization can continue performing its critical  functions even with as much as a 40 percent reduction in its workforce for  a prolonged period\u2014the level that the federal government has advised  should be used for planning for a severe pandemic.", "In general, the seven critical organizations that we reviewed all intend to  use existing geographically dispersed facilities to increase the distance  among staff who perform critical functions. Staff from all seven critical  organizations are spread among facilities located across the United States,  including data centers, which are monitored by computer operators, and  office or business centers with key staff that assist customers. Each of  these organizations has created duplicate sites with redundant staffed data  centers and locations or space for other critical staff. For example,  officials from one organization told us that their three facilities are  considerably distant from each other (i.e., hundreds of miles) in order to  mitigate the effect of natural disasters, power and telecom outages, and  other wide-scale regional disruptions, including a pandemic. The  organizations plan to use these geographically dispersed sites to maximize  social distancing and increase their ability to continue operating during a  pandemic. Having sites with staff that perform critical functions in more  than one location also provides these organizations with pools of cross- trained employees that they can draw on during a pandemic. For example,  one organization\u2019s pandemic plan relies on staff performing critical  activities that are evenly divided across two geographically distant  facilities in different regions of the country. This organization also has an  alternate facility in the same metropolitan area as its primary location.  Under its plan, during the final stage of a pandemic, when the United  States is experiencing sustained transmission of the disease, some staff  from its primary site are to report to the nearby alternate facility to do  their critical activities, thus allowing the organization to increase the  physical distance between the individual members of its critical staff."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staffing Analyses or Documentation Can Be Improved", "paragraphs": ["Although each organization has developed plans for continuing operations  during a pandemic, our analysis indicated that three of the seven have not  fully analyzed or documented the number of staff able to perform critical  functions who would be available during a pandemic. With the federal  government indicating that organizations should plan for absenteeism of  40 percent at the peak of a severe pandemic, under such circumstances  approximately one in every three of an organization\u2019s employees could be  ill or caring for ill family members. Although regulators\u2019 guidance does not  specify the extent of cross-training required, we believe that, at a  minimum, an organization would need two staff capable of performing  each critical activity to allow for one to be absent while the other  continues working. Organizations should probably have three staff capable  of performing or cross-trained to take over these tasks to provide  additional assurance that enough staff would be available. For example,  the federal guidance on continuity of operations planning recommends  that organizations should probably have three staff capable for key  positions.", "Because these organizations have multiple operating sites with staff  located in each that are capable of performing many of their critical  activities, they have some assurance that they likely have enough  employees to continuing operating during a pandemic. But, not all  organizations have fully analyzed or documented the number of staff that  could be available across all critical positions and tasks. All the  organizations have identified their critical functions and all have lists of at  least some of the essential staff for each of the departments performing  those functions. Four critical organizations have developed lists that show  the current staff for each critical function, backup staff, and sufficient  numbers of staff who are cross-trained or already know these functions  who could serve as additional backup support. One of these organizations  rotates the performance of its critical functions through three  geographically distant operation sites on an ongoing basis, ensuring a large  group of cross-trained staff. For example, this organization has a list of 36  staff for one of the critical departments, all of whom are trained to  perform functions normally requiring 8 staff. Thus the organization has 8  backup staff as well as 20 additional trained staff that it can draw upon.  Another of the four organizations identified seven essential services that  its organization needs to perform and prepared listings for each of these  departments that identify the primary staff performing the functions, the  backups for these staff, and additional staff that are knowledgeable or  cross-trained to perform these duties. For example, one of the essential  departments has a list of 19 staff that are trained to perform one set of  critical functions that normally require only 5 employees\u2014a surplus of 14.  In addition, this organization cross-trained an additional 7 staff to serve as  further backup support. Henceforth, these organizations identified  additional staff beyond the primary and backup employees for each  critical function\u2014producing more than two staff capable of performing  each critical activity\u2014to have greater assurance of being able to perform  their critical functions.", "The importance of sufficiently analyzing and documenting the adequacy of  critical staffing was demonstrated by one of the critical organizations that  has comprehensively identified its staff and backups. This organization  participated in an industry-wide pandemic exercise that revealed it needed  to identify even larger numbers of trained staff for some departments. The  exercise simulated the impact of a pandemic by declaring that all staff  with last names beginning with certain letters would be unavailable for  work. Although at one point in the exercise the scenario called for 40 to 50  percent absenteeism, this organization found that in one of its critical  departments, as many as 78 percent of its staff were projected to be  unavailable. As a result, this organization has re-examined its staffing  arrangement to identify staff that currently perform other activities that  could be used to perform critical functions if needed. The results from the  exercise demonstrated the need to determine, in advance of an outbreak,  sufficient numbers of staff capable of performing critical functions.", "In contrast, three of the seven critical organizations have not fully  developed lists of staff capable of performing critical functions. For  example, at one organization each critical department listed essential staff,  but only at a managerial level (e.g., vice president of a department, and  one backup) but did not identify staff that perform the department\u2019s  functions on a day-to-day basis. The other two organizations created lists  of essential staff by department, but the lists were completed only during  the recent H1N1 outbreak rather than in advance. None of these three  organizations listed primary, backup, or other staff for the critical  functions. Officials at one of these organizations told us they have staff at  several geographic locations and that business continuity tests for one of  their critical departments demonstrated they can operate their  organization\u2019s critical information systems. As a result, they said that the  geographic distance among locations and testing efforts provided them  with a group of cross-trained staff that would be sufficient to continue  operations even if 40 percent were absent. While this provides some  assurance that this organization may be able to withstand a pandemic, as  one organization learned, undergoing more extensive analysis and  documentation allows organizations to identify gaps in staffing levels that  would be unique to a pandemic, when large numbers of staff could be  unavailable for prolonged periods.

As noted previously, the critical market  organizations included in our review generally rely on proprietary  communications networks that will not likely be affected by any  pandemic-related congestion. However, five of the seven critical  organizations plan to have some of their critical staff telework during a  pandemic, and the readiness of these organizations to successfully have  employees telework varies. Based on our reviews, only one of the five  organizations fully developed suitable alternatives to teleworking in case  of Internet congestion. This organization identified hotels with increased  broadband Internet access capability in the employees\u2019 residential  neighborhoods that staff could report to in order to improve their ability to  telework. Another of the five organizations developed a plan for some of  the critical staff that would be teleworking to come into one of its facilities  that is currently prepared as a backup site. This facility is currently ready  for operations and has ample space to provide adequate social distance for  employees that find they cannot successfully telework due to congestion.  However, the organization has not made adequate preparations for some  critical staff in another geographic area to telework during a pandemic. If  these employees are not able to telework, the organization plans to have  them report to its office there and work in an unused part of the facility.  But it has not outfitted this area with additional workstations that would  allow its staff to work there effectively.", "Furthermore, three of the critical organizations whose plans include  possibly having some of their critical employees telework have not fully  developed plans for alternatives to teleworking should congestion arise.", "Our review of their plans show that the three organizations have not  designated the necessary positions or employees who would telework.  Determining the total number of teleworkers in advance of an outbreak  would allow the organizations to confirm that their network systems can  fully support that number, which would likely be higher than it might be in  the course of a normal work day, and that these employees have full  access to all the applications or systems they need in order to perform  their critical duties effectively from home. These organizations have also  not developed and assessed the feasibility of alternatives to teleworking in  their plans. For example, one of these organizations told us that, if  congestion occurs, they would bring staff back into their facilities and  have them conduct their work wirelessly. However, they have not  documented this in their planning or tested the feasibility of this approach  for all potential critical activities. The other two organizations have not  determined in their plans what steps they would take to respond to  congestion problems experienced by their teleworking employees. Until  all the critical organizations develop additional measures to ensure they  have viable alternative strategies if teleworking proves difficult, they might  be at greater risk of having some aspects of their operations disrupted  during a pandemic."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Critical Organizations Reviewed Have Tested Plans and Ensured Ongoing Review to Varying Extents", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis shows that while all seven of the critical organizations we  reviewed participated in an industry-wide pandemic scenario test, some  have not conducted similar tests internally. All of the organizations  reported that they participated in a 3-week industry-wide pandemic  exercise, sponsored jointly by FBIIC, FSSCC, Treasury, and the Securities  Industry and Financial Markets Association, which began in September  2007. The exercise simulated a pandemic occurring in three waves and  reaching an absenteeism rate as high as 49 percent. As previously  mentioned, each scenario update included an absenteeism distribution  specified by first letters of employees\u2019 last names, as a way to approximate  the scenario\u2019s target absenteeism rate. The scenario updates were  provided to participants 1 week in advance so that each organization had  adequate time to review its human resources records, identify the absent  individuals, and determine the distribution of the absent employees among  their various departments and units as appropriate. This method provided  a probable picture of the range of absent employees, which could be from  the lowest levels to the top of an organization. Organizations that did not  want to carry out such a review of their records were allowed to simply  use the provided absenteeism rate (25 percent, 49 percent, and 35 percent)  for each scenario update.", "Officials from the critical organizations indicated that the exercise was  useful in planning for a possible pandemic. As noted previously, one  organization participating in this exercise experienced as much as 78  percent absenteeism in some of its departments\u2014higher than the  expected 49 percent projection\u2014and has taken steps to identify additional  staff capable of performing its critical functions. Officials from another  organization said the exercise highlighted variation in human resource  policies\u2014for example, in the distribution of antiviral medication and the  use of hazard pay across regional offices. As a result, the organization  convened relevant staff to discuss consistent policy issues and  infrastructure resiliency across regions. In addition to the industry-wide  effort, three of the organizations have conducted or plan to conduct  additional internal pandemic tests to ensure readiness. One of the  organizations has conducted pandemic exercises for managers and staff at  each facility, using a set of questionnaires corresponding to various  scenarios. Another organization told us that it planned to conduct a full- day pandemic response test at all of its facilities in 2009. However, four of  the organizations have not run internal pandemic scenario tests. As  discussed earlier, the results from the industry-wide test demonstrated the  need for the critical organizations to assess their staffing, backup, and  cross-training levels to ensure they are sufficient to meet the  organization\u2019s needs during a pandemic. Internal pandemic scenario tests  would give organizations just such an opportunity.", "In addition to pandemic scenario testing, all seven organizations have  tested their abilities to run critical applications and functions at their  alternate backup facilities as part of their business continuity testing.  These efforts will provide further assurance that these sites will be viable  for use during a pandemic. Some of the organizations rotate operations  between the primary and the backup facility on a regular basis, while  others operate certain processes simultaneously at the primary and the  secondary facilities. For example, one of the organizations conducts six  remote-site recovery tests per year, simulating failure of applications.  Meanwhile, another organization has begun recovery testing by alternating  its full production cycle between the two key facilities. Further, all but one  of the five firms that intend to employ teleworking as part of their  pandemic plan have assessed their work-from-home capabilities\u2014an  essential part of planning for extensive teleworking to ensure that the  organizations\u2019 telecommunications systems can support the large amounts  of traffic that would be generated. One organization in particular tested  work-from-home infrastructure to ensure continuity of daily production as  early as mid-2007 and continues to test connectivity as its  telecommunications infrastructure is upgraded. Another organization told  us it conducted several work-from-home tests in 2008, including server  stress test and tests featuring full-volume transaction levels. This kind of  testing is critical to pandemic planning, especially for those organizations  that intend to have some of their critical staff work from home.", "Our analysis also indicates that six of the seven of the organizations have  procedures in place to ensure their pandemic plans are being reviewed  and updated. Because pandemic plans should be sufficiently flexible to  effectively address a wide range of possible effects that could result from a  pandemic, ongoing review and updates will ensure a plan has up-to-date  policies, standards, and procedures. Officials from the six organizations  told us that the pandemic plans are reviewed on a regular basis, either at  the business-department level or in some cases by the audit committee or  the Board of Directors. For example, at one organization the audit  committee reviews the pandemic plan and reports its assessment and  findings to the Board of Directors on an annual basis. At another  organization, the departmental plan is prepared by the department  manager and is approved by the director. However, at one organization  executives have seen the pandemic plan, but it has not been formally  approved. This organization told us it recently instituted a pandemic flu  committee that will formally review and approve the pandemic plan.  Regular review and approval by senior management helps to ensure that  adequate resources are dedicated to implementing the plan. Furthermore,  with the changes occurring across financial organizations due to the  recent market turmoil, regular review helps an organization confirm that  its plan is still aligned effectively to its organizational structure."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "SEC Has Taken Significant Steps to Assess Securities Market Organizations\u2019 Pandemic Preparedness, but Could Do More", "paragraphs": ["As the regulator that oversees stock and options exchanges, clearing  organizations, and broker-dealers, SEC has taken various actions to ensure  that market organizations are preparing for a pandemic, including issuing  guidance and conducting examinations of market participants\u2019  preparations, but could take additional steps to better oversee firms\u2019  readiness. To ensure the readiness of the participants in the securities  markets, SEC has issued various communications that provided guidance  outlining its expectations for these entities\u2019 pandemic preparation efforts.  For example, in April 2006, SEC sent a letter to securities exchanges and  clearing organizations advising them to plan for a pandemic and make  preparations intended to keep the markets operating. SEC\u2019s letter noted  that the organizations\u2019 existing business continuity programs were usually  designed to address a discrete event and therefore could prove inadequate  to address the potentially long-lasting impact of a pandemic. SEC staff also  spoke at conferences, meetings with market participants, and other  forums, such as those sponsored by industry trade associations, to share  information about pandemic issues. Although securities regulators had  taken various actions to help the financial markets prepare, our 2007  report indicated that additional actions could further improve the financial  market\u2019s readiness to withstand an influenza pandemic. In response to  our recommendation, SEC provided more specific guidance between July  and October 2007 to the securities exchanges, clearing organizations, and  broker-dealers that indicated that these organizations\u2019 pandemic plans  include various key elements, such as procedures for continuing  operations during even severe pandemics, and that the plans be in place by  the end of 2007.", "To ensure that securities market organizations are taking adequate steps  to be ready for a pandemic, SEC has been conducting examinations of  various market participants\u2019 preparations that cover, among other things,  pandemic preparedness plans.

From January 2007 to June  2009, SEC\u2019s Division of Trading and Markets staff had conducted nine  examinations addressing business continuity planning and pandemic  preparedness at the critical organizations included in our review.

However, after examining one of the  organizations in October 2008, SEC staff made various recommendations  to direct this organization to improve its pandemic planning.

However, as noted earlier, our reviews of the critical  market organizations indicate that three of the five critical securities  market organizations have not adequately documented the number of staff  who could perform critical functions if many of the staff that currently  perform those functions are unavailable during a pandemic. Our reviews  of SEC\u2019s examination reports show that SEC staff identified weaknesses in  the staffing analysis at one of these critical organizations but not at the  other two. SEC staff acknowledged that ensuring adequate numbers of  critical staff is important. But they said they had not expected the  organizations to document the adequacy of their staffing for all their  positions because staff in critical departments were likely to be  interchangeable and thus could fill in for each other.

As the attacks showed, the inability of individual  securities market participants to promptly clear and settle transactions  can pose significant financial risks to other participants. In response, SEC,  the Federal Reserve, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  jointly issued the Interagency Paper on Sound Practices to Strengthen the  Resilience of the U.S. Financial System (Sound Practices) in April 2003.

Telecommunications providers will have  limited options to expand network infrastructure during an outbreak, and  possible network management techniques would likely require  government action in order for providers to avoid violating existing  customer service agreements. DHS is the federal agency responsible for  working with the private sector to ensure that the critical communications  sector, which includes the networks that comprise the Internet, is  protected from attacks and other disasters. Although DHS has taken some  actions relating to pandemic and possible Internet congestion, it has not  taken the necessary steps to develop a strategy for addressing such  congestion.", "In addition, developing an effective Internet congestion response plan will  likely require coordination with various other federal agencies, including  the Department of Education, HHS, and FCC. As the experience of  Hurricane Katrina showed, working in advance of a crisis to understand  the proper roles and responsibilities of various federal and other entities is  important for ensuring an effective response, but DHS has not taken  extensive actions to coordinate with other relevant federal and private  sector entities about actions that could potentially reduce Internet  congestion and how best to respond. In addition, an important step for  ensuring the federal government is prepared to address pandemic-related  Internet congestion will be identifying whether any federal entity currently  has the needed authority to take any actions determined to be necessary.  However, whether DHS, FCC, or others have sufficient existing authorities  to direct private sector Internet providers to take the actions necessary to  relieve congestion is not clear. Similarly, although its own study showed  that obtaining public cooperation in reducing nonessential use of the  Internet could greatly resolve the potential pandemic-related congestion,  DHS has not taken steps to assess the effectiveness and feasibility of  mounting such a campaign to begin developing one. Until DHS develops  an effective response strategy, coordinates with federal and other partners  on actions to take, determines whether sufficient authorities to act exist or  are sought, and evaluates the need for a public campaign, employees in  critical sectors of the nation\u2019s economy, including those in financial  services, might not be able to effectively telework or otherwise  communicate or transmit data over the Internet during a pandemic.", "Seven critical securities market organizations that we reviewed have taken  significant steps to better ensure they would be able to continue operating  during a pandemic, including by developing plans that address the key  elements of pandemic planning. However, some of these organizations  could better document the adequacy of their staffing levels and ensure  they have prepared viable alternatives in the event that their teleworkers  experience Internet congestion. SEC has taken various steps, including  issuing guidance and conducting examinations, to ensure that financial  market organizations, including those critical to the overall functioning of  the markets, are prepared to continue operating during a pandemic.  However, taking additional steps during their examinations to ensure that  these organizations have fully documented the adequacy of their staffing  analyses, developed formal alternatives to teleworking, and tested these  would provide greater assurance that the financial markets\u2019 full range of  operations will not be disrupted by a pandemic."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better ensure that securities market participants as well as  organizations in other critical sectors of the economy will continue to have  access to the Internet during a pandemic, we recommend that the  Secretary of Homeland Security take the following four actions:    develop a strategy outlining actions that could be taken to address    coordinate with other relevant federal and private sector entities about  actions that could potentially reduce Internet congestion,   work with other federal partners to determine if sufficient authority exists  for one or more relevant agencies to take any contemplated actions to  address Internet congestion, and   assess the effectiveness and feasibility, and undertake if warranted, a  public education campaign to reduce such congestion.", "To better ensure that important securities market participants are making  adequate preparations for pandemic, we recommend that the Chairman,  SEC, ensure that SEC staff take steps to ensure that critical financial  market organizations are fully documenting the adequacy of their staffing  levels to withstand high absenteeism and have formally developed  alternative strategies in the event that congestion limits teleworking  effectiveness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Secretary of Homeland Security,  the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of the Treasury,  the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the  Chairman of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Comptroller of  the Currency, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission,  and the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission for their  review and comment.

She noted that she also  agrees that critical market organizations can take steps to improve their  existing pandemic plans. Accordingly, the Chairman indicated that SEC will  issue letters to these organizations recommending that they further  document their staff cross-training arrangements and their plans to maintain  operations if Internet congestion impairs their ability to rely on telework for  support functions. Further, SEC staff will review compliance with this  recommendation in future examinations of these organizations. The  Chairman also noted that SEC is prepared to assist other agencies to help  address the problem of potential Internet congestion.", "In a written response to a draft of this report, the Director of DHS\u2019s  Departmental GAO/OIG Liaison Office concurs in part with our  recommendations that DHS should, among other things, develop a strategy  outlining actions that could be taken to address potential Internet congestion.   The Director\u2019s letter states that the agency agrees to take these steps to  mitigate the impact of any pandemic-related congestion on the systems that  the federal government uses to communicate critical national  security/emergency preparedness (NS/EP) information, but that addressing  Internet congestion for other communications, as a general matter, does not  fall within DHS\u2019s responsibilities, and that DHS does not have the  responsibility for developing an Internet congestion strategy separate and  apart from assuring NS/EP communications. While we agree that DHS should  ensure that NS/EP communications are maintained, DHS has been broadly  tasked with leading efforts to prevent disruptions to the nation\u2019s overall  telecommunications infrastructure and is the agency best positioned to do so.   As discussed in this report, federal policies and plans assign DHS lead  responsibility for facilitating a public/private response to and recovery from  major Internet disruptions. DHS was designated under HSPD-7 as the lead  agency for coordinating the protection of the communications sector\u2014a role  it plays for several of the other sectors that have been identified as the  nation\u2019s critical infrastructures and key resources.  As lead agency for this  sector, DHS is to conduct vulnerability assessments and encourage risk  management strategies to protect and mitigate against attacks.  HSPD-7 also  notes that agencies are responsible for working with their sectors to reduce  the consequences of catastrophic failures not cased by terrorism.  Similarly,  the 2009 National Infrastructure Protection Plan notes that risk in the 21st  century results from a complex mix of man-made and naturally occurring  threats and hazards, including terrorist attacks, accidents, natural disasters,  and other emergencies.  Under this plan\u2019s risk analysis and management  framework, sector-specific agencies are to combine consequence,  vulnerability, and threat information to produce assessments of risks to a  sector and enhance protection by setting goals and objectives, establishing  priorities for mitigating risks, and implementing protective programs and  resiliency strategies.  Based on the study that DHS itself led, congestion  resulting from a pandemic appears to be one of the threats for which DHS is  tasked with ensuring an adequate governmental response.  Furthermore, for  example, The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace notes that the Internet  is at the core of the information infrastructure upon which we depend,  connecting millions of other computer networks and making most of the  nation\u2019s essential services and infrastructures work.  According to this  strategy, DHS has important responsibilities to develop plans to secure these  key resources and infrastructures and provide assistance to the private sector  and other government entities with respect to recovery plans for failures in  critical information systems.  DHS has already been working to address  threats to the Internet, for example, by establishing an Internet Disruption  Working Group to work with the private sector to establish priorities and  develop action plans to prevent major disruptions of the Internet and to  identify recovery measures in the event of a major disruption.  DHS also has  an ongoing relationship with the communications sector coordinating  council, which consists of various private sector telecommunications  providers, that could assist in assessing and developing solutions to this issue.   As a result of these responsibilities and its existing capabilities, we believe  that DHS is the appropriate agency to take the lead in developing a strategy to  address potential pandemic-related Internet congestion and to coordinate  with other relevant federal and private sector entities about actions that could  reduce such congestion.", "DHS also commented that congestion that affects the Internet outside of  NS/EP communications falls within the operational and administrative  interests of other federal agencies.  While we agree that other agencies,  such as FCC, should play a role in addressing the potential negative impact  on our nation\u2019s commerce and economy from pandemic-related Internet  congestion, under the existing governmental policies, DHS is the agency  that is specifically tasked with addressing threats that have the potential to  disrupt the critical communications sector.  Furthermore, this report notes  the uncertainty that exists over whether FCC has the authority to act to  address Internet-related congestion problems.  The uncertainty of roles  and authorities regarding this issue is the reason we recommended that  DHS work with other federal partners to determine if sufficient authority  exists for one or more relevant agencies to take any actions necessary to  address Internet congestion that may occur during and because of a severe  pandemic crisis. While other agencies could play critical roles in  addressing this issue, we believe that DHS, as the communications sector  lead agency, should provide this leadership and coordinate a response.   The Director\u2019s letter also includes some additional technical comments  that we address as appropriate in appendix V.", "We also received technical comments from FCC and HHS, which are  incorporated as appropriate in the report.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Homeland  Security, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and  other interested parties.

In addition, we  interviewed relevant officials at the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS), Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and the Department  of the Treasury to discuss their efforts and authorities to address potential  Internet congestion. We also interviewed representatives from  telecommunications and Internet providers that are members of the U.S.  Communications Sector Coordinating Council that provides input to DHS  regarding critical infrastructure protection issues. We also interviewed  staff at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\u2014including  staff from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2014to learn about  their efforts to educate the public about pandemic strategies. To assess the  potential Internet congestion that could occur during a pandemic, we  conducted a literature search and reviewed relevant studies and reports.  Specifically, we reviewed a study conducted by DHS in cooperation with  various government, communication sector, and financial sector  representatives. The study evaluated the technical feasibility of the  pandemic strategy advocated by the government and identified action  plans to better prepare the nation for telecommuting during a pandemic  influenza. Our review of the study included an evaluation of the study\u2019s  methodology, and interviews with the DHS staff who oversaw the research  on this study, including the Director and Chief of Staff of the Office of  Cyber Security and Communications. To confirm the accuracy of the  study\u2019s findings, we interviewed communication sector representatives  who participated in the study. We also reviewed after action reports from  two pandemic exercises\u2014one sponsored by the Financial Services Sector  Coordinating Council, Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure  Committee, and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association,  and another conducted by the United Kingdom financial sector to test the  financial sectors\u2019 resilience to pandemic influenza.", "To assess the actions that critical securities market organizations and key  market participants are taking to prepare pandemic plans, we reviewed  the actions of seven organizations\u2014including exchanges, clearing  organizations, and payment processors\u2014whose ability to operate is  critical to the overall functioning of the financial markets. To maintain the  security and the confidentiality of their proprietary information, we agreed  with these organizations that our report would not discuss their efforts to  address pandemic readiness and ensure business continuity in a way that  could identify them. To assess how these organizations ensure they can  continue operations in the face of a pandemic outbreak, we discussed  their business continuity and pandemic preparedness plans with their staff  and visited their facilities. We reviewed and analyzed their pandemic plans  and supporting business continuity documents and compared the plans to  the key elements that banking and securities regulators have issued as  guidance to financial organizations regarding pandemic planning. In  evaluating these organizations\u2019 pandemic readiness, we attempted to  determine whether these organizations\u2019 pandemic plans adequately  address the five elements required by the regulators, including: (1) a  process for monitoring the pandemic\u2019s progress and a plan that escalates  response steps as various pandemic phases are reached; (2) a preventive  program to minimize, to the extent possible, illness among employees,  including social distancing of employees by curtailing meetings; (3) a  documented strategy of facilities or procedures designed to allow the  organization to continue its critical operations in the event that large  numbers of its staff are unavailable for prolonged periods, including an  analysis of staffing levels needed for critical functions and, as applicable,  an alternative to teleworking; (4) a testing program to ensure that the  practices and capabilities will be effective and allow it to continue its  critical operations; and (5) an oversight program to ensure ongoing review  and updates to the pandemic plan.", "To assess financial regulators\u2019 efforts to assess the readiness of securities  market organizations to continue operating during a pandemic, we  reviewed relevant regulations and guidance and interviewed officials at  the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Board of Governors  of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), and the New York  Federal Reserve Bank, the Office of Comptroller of the Currency, and the  Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). We also collected and  reviewed data and reports from SEC, FINRA, and the Federal Reserve on  the examinations they conducted of exchanges, clearing organizations,  and broker-dealers. Furthermore, we reviewed a random sample of exams  conducted by FINRA of business continuity practices at clearing firms that  provide order routing and post-trade clearance and settlement processing  for other broker-dealers (introducing firms) from 2006 through 2008. We  randomly selected 9 firms of varying sizes from a total population of 56. To  assess whether the level of preparations varied by firm size, we reviewed  examinations for 3 large firms (that provided clearing for 100 or more  other broker-dealer firms), 3 medium-sized firms (those that cleared for  between 20 and 99 firms), and 3 small firms (those clearing for 19 or fewer  firms). We also interviewed officials at one of the larger clearing firms.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2008 to October 2009 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: FINRA Efforts to Oversee Pandemic Readiness of Broker-Dealers", "paragraphs": ["Although the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)\u2014the self- regulatory organization that oversees most broker-dealers in the United  States\u2014undertook some actions to improve broker-dealers\u2019 awareness of  the potential impact of a pandemic, it has only recently begun to take steps  to more fully ensure such firms are making adequate preparations. In  addition to oversight by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),  FINRA oversees broker-dealers conducting business domestically in the  United States. The broker-dealers that FINRA oversees include, but are not  limited to, two different types:  Introducing broker-dealer firms whose staff open customer accounts and  accept orders to buy and sell securities, but whose firms are not usually  members of the exchanges or clearing organizations.", "Clearing firms that maintain accounts at the central securities clearing  organization and process trades on behalf of their own customers as well  as those for the customers of the introducing brokers that use them for  trade execution or clearing processing. Clearing firms also maintain the  cash and securities holdings for their introducing firms\u2019 customers.", "According to data from FINRA, as of June 2009, 56 firms that clear for  other broker-dealers (clearing firms) were operating in the U.S. markets,  with some clearing for hundreds of firms but many clearing for less than  20 firms.", "Although most broker-dealers are not required to recommence operations  after disasters, FINRA expects its member firms to have business  continuity plans that, among other things, assess how pandemic risks  could affect the firm. Unlike the core exchanges and clearing  organizations and critical broker-dealers covered by the Interagency  Paper on Sound Practices to Strengthen the Resilience of the U.S.  Financial System, which SEC requires to be able to resume operations on  the same business day on which a wide-scale disruption occurs, broker- dealers have the option of recommencing their operations or shutting  down if they are unable to continue. Since 2004, FINRA has had rules that  require broker-dealers to have a business continuity plan in place that  describes how the firm will: maintain appropriate backup and recovery  functions for critical data; alternate communications between the member  and the employees; and maintain all mission critical systems, such as  those that process taking orders, and clearing and settling securities  trades. As a result, at a minimum the FINRA business continuity rule  requires all of its member broker-dealers to have adequate plans for  ensuring customers have prompt access to their funds and securities in the  event that the broker-dealer discontinues business operations. Although  FINRA\u2019s business continuity rules were issued before a pandemic was  widely recognized as a potential threat to the financial markets, the  organization issued guidance in 2006 that encourages broker-dealers to  ensure that they assess whether or not their business continuity plans  would be suitable for prolonged, widespread public health emergencies,  such as a pandemic outbreak. Also in 2006, FINRA requested comment on  potential regulatory relief granted in response to a pandemic. FINRA  officials told us they have also emphasized the importance of addressing  pandemic as part of business continuity planning to the broker-dealer staff  that attend industry conferences and workshops.", "However, prior to June 2009, FINRA had not begun to actively assess the  readiness of broker-dealers, including clearing firms. FINRA examines  firms on a rotational basis\u2014depending on the risk level and complexity of  firms\u2019 operations\u2014every 1, 2, or 4 years for compliance with a broad range  of regulatory issues, including business continuity planning. According to  data submitted to us by FINRA, across the 56 firms that clear for other  broker-dealers, their staff conducted 40 examinations for compliance with  the business continuity rules in 2006, 39 in 2007, 46 in 2008, with 33  completed or scheduled for 2009. When FINRA conducts the business  continuity examinations, the inspectors use 1 or more of 13 business  continuity planning examination modules to guide the inspection.  However, the initial set of business continuity examination modules that  FINRA staff have been using in their examinations to assess firms\u2019  compliance with the business continuity rule did not include questions  related to pandemic preparedness.", "In addition, our own review of FINRA-conducted inspections found that  FINRA officials have not been addressing pandemic issues to a great  extent in business continuity examinations conducted through June 2009.  We reviewed FINRA business continuity exams from 2006 to 2008 for a  randomly selected sample of 9 of the 56 clearing firms that clear for other  firms to assess the extent to which pandemic issues were being addressed.  To assess whether the level of preparations varied by firm size, we  reviewed examinations for 3 large firms (that provided clearing for 100 or  more introducing brokers), 3 medium-sized firms (those that cleared for  between 20 and 99 firms), and 3 small firms (those clearing for 19 or fewer  firms). Our review found that the inspections for 8 of the 9 firms showed  evidence the FINRA examiner reviewed the firm\u2019s plan for compliance  with the 10 business continuity elements required to be addressed by  FINRA\u2019s business continuity rule. However, we found limited evidence  that the examiners reviewed pandemic readiness at the firms. For three of  the firms, the examination documentation included some general  discussions about these firms\u2019 pandemic planning, and in three cases we  saw evidence that pandemic plans were included in the documents  reviewed by the FINRA examiners.", "Although the full extent to which clearing firms are ready to continue  operating during a pandemic has not been assessed, some evidence raised  concerns that not all are making adequate preparations. We did not  attempt to systematically determine clearing firms\u2019 pandemic readiness,  but we did interview staff at one of the largest clearing firms. This firm\u2019s  staff described a pandemic plan and procedures that appeared reasonably  likely to be able to continue operations even in the face of significant  absenteeism. However, as noted earlier, a limited review by SEC staff  conducted in 2008 found that three of four midsized clearing firms have  not developed plans for continuing operations during a pandemic. If  clearing firms such as these are not able to continue operating, customers  of the introducing broker-dealers that use the clearing firms experiencing  such problems potentially could find access to their funds and securities  curtailed for significant periods of time. For example, FINRA staff told us  transferring the customer accounts of broker-dealers that cease operations  can take several days or weeks, depending on the circumstances.", "In response to the recent H1N1 outbreak and our inquiries in relation to  this review, FINRA staff told us they have begun various efforts to more  broadly assess the readiness of broker-dealers, including clearing firms,  for a pandemic. Beginning in June 2009, FINRA conducted a voluntary  survey of broker-dealer firms to determine preparedness for a pandemic.  The survey included questions asking, among other things, whether the  firm has conducted a review of the potential impact of a pandemic, and  whether the firm has a business continuity plan specifically addressing a  pandemic, and if so, how that plan is being tested. The survey results show  that almost all respondents report having conducted a review of the  potential impact of a pandemic, and have business continuity plans that  specifically address pandemic preparedness. FINRA is using the results of  the survey to develop additional guidance on pandemic preparedness  practices for the industry. In addition, FINRA staff told us they have  developed a new examination module that addresses pandemic  preparedness. This module requires their examiners to determine whether  the firm\u2019s business continuity arrangements for resuming business  operations appear reasonable given the conditions likely to prevail during  a pandemic. For example, the module directs the examiner to review the  firm\u2019s business continuity planning to determine if the procedures address  risks associated with pandemic, such as taking steps to limit the spread of  influenza among its staff, and assessing the firm\u2019s operational capabilities  using teleworking and the impact of requiring employees to work  remotely. The new module was piloted by FINRA examiners during the  summer of 2009, and then, once revised as needed, will be used in  upcoming exams. FINRA officials told us they will conduct a pandemic  preparedness review at all the firms that clear for other broker-dealers by  the end of 2011."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Steps Taken by Bank Regulators to Assess Pandemic Preparedness in Key Clearing Banks", "paragraphs": ["Banking regulators for the key clearing banks have taken actions to assess  pandemic readiness among banks, including those that clear transactions  for the securities markets. The Federal Reserve and the Office of  Comptroller of the Currency issued guidance in 2006 that call for all banks  under their supervision to include the unique impacts of a pandemic in  their business continuity planning. Similar to securities regulators, the  bank regulators had taken actions to help banks and thrifts address  pandemic efforts in our last review. For example, in a joint notice from the  regulators that oversee banks and thrifts, the agencies indicated that their  institutions should review the U.S. government\u2019s national pandemic  strategy to consider what actions may be appropriate for their particular  situations, and whether such actions should be included in their event  response and contingency strategies. Furthermore, banking regulators  had also begun to review pandemic planning in the context of their  ongoing supervisory activities. However, in response to the  recommendation we made in our 2007 report, the Federal Reserve and the  Office of the Comptroller of the Currency subsequently notified  institutions that play systemically important roles in securities and other  markets that these entities should have plans that address even severe  pandemics. In addition, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination  Council issued an updated examination manual regarding information  technology and business continuity issues that includes steps that banks  should be taking related to pandemic planning.", "Banking regulators have also been conducting reviews to ensure that  banks are preparing for possible pandemics, and through these efforts  confirmed that the critical market institutions under their supervision met  the 2007 deadline to have a pandemic plan in place, and that those plans  include the required elements. For example, the Federal Reserve began a  series of reviews\u2014using a set of questionnaires to collect information on  the planning elements established in the guidance\u2014in January 2008 to  assess the progress made by the top 15 banking organizations in the  country and concluded that considerable progress has been made among  its member banks in pandemic planning. The review objectives were to  provide a broad perspective of the state of pandemic preparedness at  systemic institutions, identifying trends within the pandemic preparedness  planning process, and to provide peer benchmarking attributes to the  participating institutions. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  officials told us they continue to monitor progress on pandemic planning  in national banks through ongoing supervision rather than targeted exams,  and they have been evaluating the banks\u2019 efforts using the newly issued  business continuity planning guidance that includes the requirements for  pandemic plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of Homeland  Security\u2019s letter dated October 14, 2009."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  The likely usefulness of teleworking as a way for government agencies  and businesses to continue operations during a pandemic is one of the  reasons we believe that DHS should take the lead in addressing  potential Internet congestion that could arise during a severe  pandemic, including working with private sector providers to  encourage them to take proper steps to be prepared not only to ensure  that NS/EP communications are not affected, but that any adverse  impact on all other communications is also mitigated.   2.  Although not citing the FCC opinion and order by number, our report  does discuss some of the network management techniques noted by  those documents that providers might be able to use to relieve  pandemic-related congestion. However, as our report notes, these  techniques may have limitations in resolving the type of congestion  envisioned to occur in residential neighborhoods. In addition,  providers told us that they would require government direction to  implement such techniques to reduce congestion, which is why we  recommend that DHS begin taking steps to determine what strategies,  actions, and authorities are needed to address this issue so that if it  appears that private sector providers must be asked to take steps, such  direction can come from the appropriate government source.", "Furthermore, as the report notes, providers told us their remote  network management tools may be a way for them to continue their  operations with reduced workforces resulting from pandemic-related  absenteeism and that these tools could be used to re-route traffic  around congested areas in regional networks or the national backbone,  but not to relieve congestion in the residential neighborhoods.    3.  As our report states, the DHS study of the impact of pandemic on  Internet access notes that obtaining the cooperation of the general  public in limiting bandwidth-intensive Internet activities was shown by  the study\u2019s modeling to be an effective way to relieve congestion.   Uncertainty over whether such cooperation could be obtained is the  reason that we recommend that DHS assess the effectiveness and  feasibility of implementing a public information campaign, and if  warranted, begin developing one.  Regarding DHS\u2019s suggested addition  of the techniques noted in the FCC order, as we noted above, we  discussed these techniques with providers and learned they may have  limitations in addressing the type of congestion envisioned to arise in a  pandemic and providers would likely require government direction to  take such actions.   4.  This comment was sent to us earlier as a part of DHS\u2019s technical  comments and we have revised the text to note that some of this  information has been made available publicly.  The best practices that  DHS cites in response would likely improve telecommunication  providers\u2019 readiness for a pandemic, but likely would not be sufficient  to relieve the congestion in residential neighborhoods.  5.  This statement was intended to serve as an example of the types of  comments FCC received regarding the prioritization issue.  We did not  assess whether this suggestion was feasible or comports with other  FCC practices.   6.  As noted above, the best practices DHS cites could assist providers in  being better prepared for a pandemic. However, they are not likely  sufficient to address residential neighborhood congestion, which is  why DHS\u2019s own study also proposed best practices for enterprises,  teleworkers, and the public. Providers did not provide us information  on any steps they were taking to advise the public about practices that  could relieve congestion during a pandemic. In fact, one provider told  us a good approach to manage Internet congestion effectively would  be for the government to work with providers to publicize appropriate  best practices and issue related guidance. As a result, we recommend  that DHS assess the effectiveness and feasibility of such practices and  implement such a campaign if warranted. 7.  We changed the language in this report to note that DHS has not taken  action related to evaluating a public education campaign because other  activities supporting its operational mission have taken priority.   Nevertheless, we believe that such activities should be undertaken to  address potential pandemic-related congestion.  8.  As this report discusses, much of the securities market\u2019s critical  communication would not be affected by congestion of the public  Internet infrastructure because it travels over dedicated proprietary  networks.  However, financial sector organizations are planning to use  teleworking to varying degrees as part of their plans to continue  operations during a pandemic.  As a result, these staff, as a well as the  staff of other U.S. federal, state, or local governments and private  businesses that plan to use teleworking from home during a pandemic  would be affected by the congestion that is envisioned to affect  residential neighborhoods.  As a result, we recommend that DHS to  take actions to address this issue.", "Furthermore, our report discusses securities market organizations\u2019  activities to prepare themselves to effectively telework during a  pandemic and describes the limitations we found in these efforts.
