The program is developing and fielding three aircraft variants for the Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and eight international partners. The F-35 is critical to long-term recapitalization plans as it is intended to replace hundreds of existing aircraft. This will require a long-term sustained funding commitment. Total U.S. investment is nearing $400 billion to develop and procure 2,457 aircraft through 2037. Fifty-two aircraft have been delivered through 2012. The F-35 program has been extensively restructured over the last 3 years to address prior cost, schedule, and performance problems. DOD approved a new acquisition program baseline in March 2012. GAO's prior reviews of the F-35 made numerous recommendations to improve outcomes, such as increasing test resources and reducing annual procurement quantities.", "This testimony is largely based on GAO's recently released report, GAO-13-309 .

Overall, the program progressed on several fronts during 2012 to further improve the current outlook. The program achieved 7 of 10 key management objectives and made substantial progress on one other. Two objectives on aircraft deliveries and a corrective management plan were not met. The F-35 development test program substantially met expectations with some revisions to flight test plans and made considerable progress addressing key technical risks. Software management practices and some output measures improved, although deliveries to test continued to lag behind plans. Manufacturing and supply processes also improved--indicators such as factory throughput, labor efficiency, and quality measures were positive. While initial F-35 production overran target costs and delivered aircraft late, the latest data shows labor hours decreasing and deliveries accelerating.", "The F-35 program still faces considerable challenges and risks. Ensuring that the F-35 is affordable and can be bought in the quantities and time required by the warfighter will be a paramount concern to the Congress, DOD, and international partners. With more austere budgets looming, F-35 acquisition funding requirements average $12.6 billion annually through 2037. Once fielded, the projected costs of sustaining the F-35 fleet have been deemed unaffordable by DOD officials; efforts to reduce these costs are underway. Software integration and test will be challenging as many complex tasks remain to enable full warfighting capability. The program is also incurring substantial costs for rework-currently projected at $1.7 billion over 10 years of production-to fix problems discovered during testing. With two-thirds of development testing still to go, additional changes to design and manufacturing are likely. The program continues to incur financial risk from its plan to procure 289 aircraft for $57.8 billion before completing development flight testing."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO has made prior recommendations to help reduce risk and improve outcomes, which DOD has implemented to varying degrees."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our work on the F-35 Lightning II,  also known as the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF).

The program is developing and fielding  three aircraft variants for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps and eight  international partners. The F-35 is the linchpin of U.S. and partner plans  to replace existing fighters and support future combat operations. In a  time of austere federal budgets, DOD continues to project significant  long-term sustained funding requirements for the F-35 while, at the same  time, pursuing several other expensive systems. Over the past 3 years,  DOD has extensively restructured the F-35 program to address poor cost,  schedule, and performance outcomes. Most recently, in March 2012,  DOD established a new, more realistic, F-35 acquisition program baseline  that reflects increased costs, longer schedule times, and deferred  procurement of 410 aircraft to the future.

My testimony  today is largely based on the results of our latest review, and addresses  (1) the progress the F-35 program made in 2012 and (2) the major risks  that the program faces going forward. To conduct our work, we reviewed  program status reports and briefings, management objectives, test plans  and results, and internal DOD analyses with a focus on accomplishments  in calendar year 2012 compared to original plans for that year. We  obtained manufacturing data and cumulative outputs from the start of  production in 2007 through the end of 2012, and discussed development  and production issues and results to date, future expansion plans, and  improvement efforts with DOD, F-35 program, and contractor officials. We  toured the aircraft manufacturing plant, obtained production and supply  performance indicators, identified cumulative and projected engineering  changes, and discussed factory improvements and management controls  with members of the contractor\u2019s work force and DOD plant  representatives. We evaluated DOD\u2019s restructuring actions and impacts  on the program, tracked cost and schedule changes from program start to  the March 2012 baseline, and determined factors driving the changes.

However, additional  work remains to fully address those risks. These risk areas and the  actions taken in 2012 are discussed below:  1.  Helmet mounted display (HMD)\u2014DOD continued to address technical  issues with the HMD system. The original helmet mounted display,  integral to mission systems, encountered significant technical  deficiencies and did not meet warfighter requirements. The program is  pursuing a dual path by developing a second, less capable helmet  while working to fix the first helmet design. In 2012, DOD began  dedicated ground and flight testing to address these issues. Both  variations of the helmet mounted display are being evaluated and  program and contractor officials told us that they have increased  confidence that the helmet deficiencies will be fixed. DOD may make  a decision in 2013 as to which helmet to procure.  2.  Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS)\u2014ALIS is an important  tool to predict and diagnose aircraft maintenance and supply issues.  ALIS systems with limited capability are in use at training and testing  locations. More capable versions of ALIS are being developed and  program and contractor officials believe that the program is on track to  fix identified shortcomings and field the fully capable system in 2015.  Limited progress was made in 2012 on developing a smaller,  transportable version needed to support unit level deployments to  operating locations.  3.  Arresting hook system\u2014The carrier variant arresting hook system  was redesigned after the original hook was found to be deficient,  which prevented active carrier trials. The program accomplished risk  reduction testing of a redesigned hook point to inform this new design.  The preliminary design review was conducted in August 2012 and the  critical design review in February 2013. Flight testing of the  redesigned system is slated for late 2013.  4.  Structural durability\u2014Over time, testing has discovered bulkhead and  rib cracks on the aircraft. Structural and durability testing to verify that  all three variants can achieve expected life and identify life-limited  parts was completed in 2012. The program is testing some  redesigned structures and planning other modifications. Officials plan  to retrofit and test a production aircraft already built and make  changes to the production line for subsequent aircraft.

The program also  began prioritizing and focusing its resources on incremental software  development as opposed to the much riskier concurrent development  approach. In addition, the program began implementing improvement  initiatives recommended by an independent software review, and  evaluated the possible deferral of some of the aircraft\u2019s capabilities to  later blocks or moving them outside of the current F-35 program  altogether. At the same time, program data regarding software output  showed improvement.
