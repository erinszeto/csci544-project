Our  September report included three objectives, including one on the extent to  which DOD considers ANDSF input and meets their needs when  identifying equipment requirements. DOD deemed the information related  to that objective to be sensitive, requiring that it be protected from public  disclosure. Consequently, we removed that objective and a related  recommendation from this public report. This version includes information  on the other two objectives: (1) what has been reported about ANDSF  capabilities and capability gaps and (2) the extent to which DOD has  information about the ANDSF\u2019s ability to operate and maintain U.S.- purchased equipment.

For example, DOD has reported that the Afghan  ministries have improved in operational planning, strategic  communications, and coordination between the Ministry of Interior and  Ministry of Defense at the national level. In general, the ANA is more  capable than the ANP, according to DOD reporting.

DOD officials also noted  that the Ministry of Interior, which oversees the ANP, and Afghanistan\u2019s  justice system are both underdeveloped, hindering the effectiveness of  the ANP. Corruption, understaffing, and training shortfalls have also  contributed to the ANP\u2019s underdevelopment, according to DOD and  SIGAR reporting. The Afghan Special Security Forces are the most  capable within the ANDSF and can conduct the majority of their  operations independently without coalition enablers, according to DOD  reporting. DOD and SIGAR reports have attributed the Afghan Special  Security Forces\u2019 relative proficiency to factors such as low attrition rates,  longer training, and close partnership with coalition forces.

Our September report  included three objectives, including one on the extent to which DOD  considers ANDSF input and meets their needs when identifying  equipment requirements. DOD deemed the information related to that  objective to be sensitive, which must be protected from public disclosure.  Consequently, we removed that objective and a related recommendation  from this public report. This version includes information on the other two  objectives: (1) what has been reported about ANDSF capabilities and  capability gaps and (2) the extent to which DOD has information about  the ANDSF\u2019s ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment.  Although the information provided in this report is more limited, the report  uses the same methodology for the two objectives as the sensitive report.", "To identify what has been reported about ANDSF capabilities and  capability gaps, we reviewed North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  and DOD documents and reports, such as DOD\u2019s semiannual Section  1225 reports to Congress, produced after the start of the NATO-led  Resolute Support mission on January 1, 2015. To determine what steps  DOD and NATO have taken to try to address gaps, we reviewed reports  the Center for Naval Analyses produced for DOD, as well as DOD and  NATO documents and reports produced after January 1, 2015, and  reports from GAO, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan  Reconstruction (SIGAR), and the DOD Inspector General. We also  interviewed Center for Naval Analyses representatives and DOD officials  in the United States and Afghanistan, including DOD officials at the  Combined Security Transition Command\u2013Afghanistan (CSTC-A) and in  the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy (OSD-P) who  helped create the DOD reporting we reviewed.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has information about the  ANDSF\u2019s ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment, we  reviewed DOD documents and reports and interviewed DOD officials in  the United States and Afghanistan, including DOD officials who advise the ANDSF. We also reviewed federal internal control standards to  determine what responsibilities agencies have specifically related to  information collection. To provide illustrative examples of information  DOD has about the ANDSF\u2019s ability to operate and maintain U.S.- purchased equipment and what that information indicates about the  ANDSF\u2019s abilities and challenges, we interviewed and analyzed written  responses from DOD officials, including DOD officials who provide  procurement and lifecycle management for some ANDSF aircraft and  vehicles, about three equipment types\u2014MD-530 helicopters, Mobile  Strike Force Vehicles (MSFV), and radios. We selected these three  equipment types from a list that we developed, for an August 2017 report,  of key ANDSF equipment the United States purchased from fiscal years  2003 through 2016. We made our selections after reviewing DOD  documentation and interviewing DOD officials regarding a number of  considerations, such as (1) how critical the equipment is to the ANDSF\u2019s  ability to achieve its mission; (2) which ANDSF component uses the  equipment (i.e., Afghan National Police, Afghan National Army, or both);  (3) whether DOD intends to continue procuring the equipment for the  ANDSF; and (4) whether the equipment had been in use at least 5 years.", "We collected detailed information about the ANDSF\u2019s ability to operate  and maintain MD-530 helicopters, MSFVs, and radios, as well as other  key statistics DOD provided about the equipment, such as inventory,  average lifespan, average cost, role, and training. This information was  based mainly on DOD responses collected from January 2018 to  February 2018 as well as DOD documents and reports produced after  January 1, 2015. The total amount of MD-530s and radios authorized for  procurement was based on DOD data that we collected for our August  2017 report on key ANDSF equipment the United States purchased in  fiscal years 2003 through 2016, which we supplemented with additional  data DOD provided on U.S.-purchased equipment from October 1, 2016,  through December, 31, 2017.", "The performance audit upon which this report is based was conducted  from August 2016 to September 2018 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that  we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate, evidence  to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on  our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We subsequently worked with DOD from September 2018 to  October 2018 to prepare this public version of the original sensitive report  for public release.

In 2014, the United States purchased 12 armed  MD-530s and began retrofitting the 5 remaining trainer helicopters with  armament for operational missions to address a close air attack gap. MD- 530s were chosen to fill the gap over other aircraft, in part because they  could be delivered relatively quickly as the AAF awaited A-29 light attack  aircraft that were experiencing procurement delays, according to Department  of Defense (DOD) officials. The United States procured additional MD-530s  in 2015, 2016, and 2017 because of the aircraft\u2019s positive impact on the  battlefield, according to DOD officials (see fig. 3).", "Key Statistics   Variants: All can be armed with  .50-cal machine gun pods and/or  2.75 inch rocket pods.", "Total Authorized for  Procurement: 60 as of December  31, 2017  Inventory: 25 as of January 2018  (30 are scheduled for delivery;  attrition of 5 due to crashes and  enemy fire)", "Average Lifespan: Absent  mishaps, and with good  maintenance, there is no defined  lifespan limit for MD-530s,  according to DOD officials.", "National Army and Afghan National Police, depending on the mission, in  all but one region of Afghanistan, which is supported by other aircraft.", "MD-530s are typically tasked two at a time for missions, according to  DOD officials.", "An MD-530 crew consists of a pilot and co-pilot, according to DOD.", "Average cost: $6.3 million per  aircraft, including all electronic  devices, weapons management  systems, and weapons (excluding  ordnance), according to DOD  officials. o  Division of labor is based on the individual crew members'  capabilities, with one pilot handling navigation and communication  while the other identifies targets and operates the weapon systems.", "Army pilot advisors at Kandahar Air Field, according to DOD officials.  o  MD-530 pilot training takes about 3 years (see fig. 4)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.
