GAO's report on the results of this work (GAO-03-351) is being released today along with this testimony.

The Free Speech  Coalition, ruling that the expansion of the act to material that did not  involve and thus harm actual children in its creation is an unconstitutional  violation of free speech rights. According to government officials, this  ruling may increase the difficulty of prosecuting those who produce and  possess child pornography.

Under the traditional  Internet client/server model, access to information and services is  accomplished by interaction between clients\u2014users who request  services\u2014and servers\u2014providers of services, usually Web sites or portals.  Unlike this traditional model, the peer-to-peer model enables consenting  users\u2014or peers\u2014to directly interact and share information with each  other, without the intervention of a server. A common characteristic of  peer-to-peer programs is that they build virtual networks with their own  mechanisms for routing message traffic.", "The ability of peer-to-peer networks to provide services and connect users  directly has resulted in a large number of powerful applications built  around this model. These range from the SETI@home network (where  users share the computing power of their computers to search for  extraterrestrial life) to the popular KaZaA file-sharing program (used to  share music and other files).", "As shown in figure 4, there are two main models of peer-to-peer  networks: (1) the centralized model, in which a central server or broker  directs traffic between individual registered users, and (2) the  decentralized model, based on the Gnutella network, in which individuals  find each other and interact directly.", "As shown in figure 4, in the centralized model, a central server/broker  maintains directories of shared files stored on the computers of registered  users. When Bob submits a request for a particular file, the server/broker  creates a list of files matching the search request by checking it against its  database of files belonging to users currently connected to the network.  The broker then displays that list to Bob, who can then select the desired  file from the list and open a direct link with Alice\u2019s computer, which  currently has the file. The download of the actual file takes place directly  from Alice to Bob.", "This broker model was used by Napster, the original peer-to-peer network,  facilitating mass sharing of material by combining the file names held by  thousands of users into a searchable directory that enabled users to  connect with each other and download MP3 encoded music files. Because  much of this material was copyrighted, Napster as the broker of these  exchanges was vulnerable to legal challenges, which eventually led to its  demise in September 2002.", "In contrast to Napster, most current-generation peer-to-peer networks are  decentralized. Because they do not depend on the server/broker that was  the central feature of the Napster service, these networks are less  vulnerable to litigation from copyright owners, as pointed out by Gartner.", "In the decentralized model, no brokers keep track of users and their files.  To share files using the decentralized model, Ted starts with a networked  computer equipped with a Gnutella file-sharing program such KaZaA or  BearShare. Ted connects to Carol, Carol to Bob, Bob to Alice, and so on.  Once Ted\u2019s computer has announced that it is \u201calive\u201d to the various  members of the peer network, it can search the contents of the shared  directories of the peer network members. The search request is sent to all  members of the network, starting with Carol; members will in turn send  the request to the computers to which they are connected, and so forth. If  one of the computers in the peer network (say, for example, Alice\u2019s) has a  file that matches the request, it transmits the file information (name, size,  type, etc.) back through all the computers in the pathway towards Ted,  where a list of files matching the search request appears on Ted\u2019s  computer through the file-sharing program. Ted can then open a  connection with Alice and download the file directly from Alice\u2019s  computer.", "The file-sharing networks that result from the use of peer-to-peer  technology are both extensive and complex. Figure 5 shows a map or  topology of a Gnutella network whose connections were mapped by a  network visualization tool. The map, created in December 2000, shows  1,026 nodes (computers connected to more than one computer) and 3,752  edges (computers on the edge of the network connected to a single  computer).
