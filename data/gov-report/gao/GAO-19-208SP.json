These subnational  governments rely on the federal government for significant portions of  their revenue. Given the nature of the partnership among levels of  government in providing services, understanding potential future fiscal  conditions of the state and local government sector is important for  federal policymaking.", "To provide Congress and the public with this broader context, we  developed a fiscal model of the state and local government sector, which  we first reported on in 2007 and have regularly updated since.

The state and local government sector\u2019s operating balance is a  measure of its ability to cover expenditures in a given year using  revenues collected in the same year. Because subnational governments  are generally required to balance or nearly balance their operating  budgets, the design of our operating balance measure reflects this  characteristic of subnational governments\u2019 operating budgets.

These think tanks include the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of  Government, the Pew Charitable Trusts, the Tax Foundation Center for  Federal Tax Policy, and the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution Tax  Policy Center. We also conducted semistructured interviews on federal  and intergovernmental policy issues and related data with associations  representing state government officials, including the National Association  of State Budget Officers, the National Conference of State Legislatures,  the National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers and Treasurers;  specialists from credit rating agencies and their research divisions, such  as Moody\u2019s Analytics and Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Ratings; and senior officials from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, BEA, and the  Congressional Budget Office (CBO). We selected these organizations  and related reports based on a literature review and our prior work on  state and local government fiscal issues. These interviews primarily  focused on tax- and health-related federal policies because of their  relevance to our simulation results. Specifically, our simulations have  continually suggested that trends in tax revenues and health care  spending have contributed to large and recurring fiscal challenges for the  sector.

Specifically, CBO reported that  between 2019 and 2028, Medicaid spending is projected to grow at an  average rate of 5.5 percent per year\u2014nearly 5 percentage points of this  growth is due to an increase in per capita costs and about 1 percentage  point of this growth is due to an increase in enrollment. Data from CBO  and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) also suggest  that growth in Medicaid spending per capita is generally expected to  outpace GDP growth in the future\u2014referred to as excess cost growth.  Our estimates of Medicaid excess cost growth using CMS data suggest  that Medicaid spending per capita will grow, on average, about 0.5  percent faster than GDP per capita for the period from 2018 through  2067.", "Our simulations also suggest that health benefits for state and local  government employees and retirees\u2014a type of employee compensation  spending\u2014are likely to rise, on average, by 0.9 percentage points more  than GDP each year. Growth in these health benefits also reflects growth  in the projected number of employees and retirees and growth in the  projected amount of health benefits for each employee and retiree.  Growth in spending by states and local governments on health care per  capita, which includes spending on employee and retiree health benefits,  is generally expected to outpace GDP per capita. Data from CMS suggest  that national health expenditures per capita are likely to grow on average  about 0.8 percent faster than GDP per capita each year during the  simulation period from 2018 through 2067.

From 1998  through 2007, state and local governments\u2019 pension contributions  amounted to about 8 percent of wages and salaries on average. In  addition, for the period from 2008 through 2017, pension contributions  amounted to about 12.3 percent of wages and salaries on average. Our  simulations suggest that those pension contributions will need to be about  12.9 percent of wages and salaries for state and local governments to  meet their long-term pension obligations. This is the case even though  pension asset values have increased in recent years, from about $2.4  trillion in 2008 to about $4.2 trillion in 2017 (adjusted for inflation and  measured in 2012 dollars). This suggests that state and local  governments may need to take additional steps to manage their pension  obligations by reducing benefits or increasing employees\u2019 contributions.", "Along with pension contributions, other types of state and local  government expenditures are projected to grow more slowly than GDP.  For example, in 2017, wages and salaries of state and local government  employees constituted a large expenditure for the sector.

Our simulations  also suggest that federal investment grants (i.e., grants intended to  finance capital infrastructure investments) and other federal grants  unrelated to Medicaid (i.e., grants intended to finance education, social  services, housing, and community investment) are likely to decline as a  share of GDP.", "Further, our simulations suggest that if historical relationships between  state and local governments\u2019 tax revenues and tax bases persist, total tax  revenues for the state and local government sector will increase from 8.8  percent of GDP in 2018 to 9.4 percent of GDP by the end of the  simulation period. This increase is driven largely by the growth in  personal income taxes, as shown in figure 8. Specifically, our simulations  suggest that personal income tax revenues will increase as a share of  GDP by about 1 percentage point during the simulation period.

Enacted in December 2017, TCJA included significant  changes to corporate and individual tax law, with implications for state  and local government tax collections. In particular, for individual  taxpayers, for tax years 2018 through 2025, tax rates were lowered for  nearly all income levels, some deductions from taxable income were  changed (personal exemptions were eliminated, while the standard  deduction was increased), and certain credits, such as the child tax credit,  were expanded.", "The effect of TCJA on the long-term state and local fiscal outlook is still  evolving, and will likely depend on how states incorporate the law\u2019s  changes into their state income tax rules. That is, because some states  link their state income taxes to federal income tax rules, states must  decide whether to let the changes from TCJA flow through to their state  income tax systems, or establish new state income tax rules. For  example, some states have adopted the federal definition of taxable  income as a starting point for state tax calculations, while other states use  the federal definition of adjusted gross income as a starting point. The  choices states make to continue to link to these definitions could have  long-term implications for their state tax revenues. In addition, under  TCJA, the amount of the federal itemized deductions allowed for all state  and local income, sales, and property taxes (commonly referred to as the  state and local tax (SALT) deduction) is now capped at $10,000 for tax  years 2018 to 2025. The magnitude or net effect of these changes is  uncertain in that states are still working to understand the impact of the  tax laws on their revenues. It remains to be seen whether and how states  will see changes in their revenues in the future.", "Moreover, a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision involving state sales  taxes could have implications for states\u2019 ability to collect revenue.  Specifically, the court\u2019s ruling in June 2018 in South Dakota v. Wayfair,  Inc. held that states could require out-of-state sellers to collect and remit  sales taxes on purchases made from those out-of-state sellers, even if  the seller does not have a substantial physical presence in the taxing  state. Prior to this ruling, a seller that did not have a substantial physical  presence in a state could not be required to collect and remit a sales tax  on goods sold into the state. Instead, a purchaser may have been  required to pay a use tax (i.e., a tax levied on the consumer for the  privilege of use, ownership, or possession of taxable goods and services)  in the same amount to his or her state government. In 2017, we  reported that states could realize between an estimated $8.5 billion and  $13.4 billion in additional state sales tax revenue across all states if all  sellers were required to collect taxes on all remote sales at current  rates. The extent to which states realize changes in sales tax revenue  will likely depend on how they revise their state laws and enforcement  efforts in response to this June 2018 ruling."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Health Care Policies", "paragraphs": ["Enacted health care legislation could also affect the long-term fiscal  position of state and local governments. As we have reported in prior  work, the effect of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  (PPACA) on the long-term state and local fiscal outlook could depend on  how states implement PPACA, and on future rates of health care cost  growth. For example, consider the states that have opted, under  PPACA, to expand Medicaid program coverage to millions of lower  income adults. While the federal government is expected to cover a large  share of the costs of the Medicaid expansion, these states are ultimately  expected to bear some of the costs. Specifically, the federal government  reimbursed 100 percent of the costs of the expanded population  beginning in 2014. This reimbursement rate will decline from the 2018  reimbursement rate of 94 percent to 90 percent by 2020. As such, the  reduced federal reimbursement rate may affect those states that  expanded their Medicaid populations in recent years.", "As discussed earlier in this report, our simulations suggest that Medicaid  spending will make up an increasing share of the state and local  government sector\u2019s operating expenditures in the future. A weakening of  the economy could add to the fiscal pressures states face in funding  these Medicaid obligations. As our prior work has shown, past recessions  in 2001 and 2007 hampered states\u2019 ability to fund increased Medicaid  enrollment and maintain their existing services. Specifically, Medicaid  enrollment increased during these recessions, in part due to increased  unemployment, which led more individuals to become eligible for the  program.", "We have also reported on the use of Medicaid demonstrations, which  allow states to test new approaches to coverage to improve quality and  access, or generate savings or efficiencies. Specifically, CMS may  waive certain Medicaid requirements and approve new types of  expenditures that would not otherwise be eligible for federal Medicaid  matching funds. For example, under demonstrations, states have  extended coverage to certain populations, provided services not  otherwise eligible for Medicaid, and made payments to providers to  incentivize delivery system improvements. We previously reported that,  as of November 2016, nearly three-quarters of states have CMS- approved demonstrations. In fiscal year 2015, federal spending under  demonstrations represented a third of all Medicaid spending nationwide.  We also reported that in 10 states, federal spending on demonstrations  represented 75 percent or more of all federal spending on Medicaid.  Joint financing of Medicaid is a fixture of this federal-state partnership.  Demonstration waivers hold the potential for changing state Medicaid  spending.

Using these projections, our simulations suggest that  maintaining current policies will cause the sector\u2019s expenditures to  exceed its revenues, and that the difference between revenues and  expenditures will become increasingly negative during the next several  decades. However, simulations developed using alternative projections of  excess cost growth in Medicaid and national health expenditures suggest  that the difference between revenues and expenditures may be reduced  but not eliminated within the simulation period if excess cost growth in  health care is zero.

Based on an inflation-adjusted rate of  return on pension assets of 5 percent, our simulations suggest that state  and local governments will need to make pension contributions equivalent  to about 12.9 percent of their wages and salaries to meet their long-term  pension obligations. However, this estimate is sensitive to the rate of  return on state and local governments\u2019 pension assets. Simulations we  developed using a higher rate of return\u20147.5 percent\u2014suggest that  pension contributions needed to meet pension obligations would be about  3 percent of state and local government employees\u2019 wages and salaries.  In addition, under this scenario, our simulations suggest that the  difference between revenues and expenditures will be reduced, but not  eliminated within the simulation period. Alternatively, we estimated that if  the rate of return on pension assets is relatively low\u2014at 2.5 percent\u2014 required pension contributions would need to be about 23 percent of state  and local government employees\u2019 wages and salaries during the  simulation period. Under this scenario, our simulations show that the  sector\u2019s negative operating balance will continue to grow larger  throughout the simulation period.
