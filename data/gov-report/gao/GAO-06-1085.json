Our review of over 3,400 deployment records at eight component locations found that components lacked documentation that some federal civilian personnel who deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq had received, among other things, required pre- and post-deployment health assessments and immunizations. These deficiencies were most prevalent at Air Force and Navy locations, and one Army location. As a larger issue, DOD lacked complete and centralized data to readily identify its deployed federal civilians and their movement in theater, further hindering its efforts to assess the overall effectiveness of its force health protection and surveillance capabilities. In August 2006, DOD issued a revised policy which outlined procedures that are intended to address these shortcomings. However, these procedures are not comprehensive enough to ensure that DOD will know the extent to which its components are complying with existing health protection requirements. In particular, the procedures do not establish an oversight and quality assurance mechanism for assessing the implementation of its force health protection and surveillance requirements. Until DOD establishes a mechanism to strengthen its force health protection and surveillance oversight, it will not be effectively positioned to ensure compliance with its policies, or the health care and protection of deployed federal civilians. DOD has also established medical treatment policies for its deployed federal civilians which provide those who require treatment for injuries or diseases sustained during overseas hostilities with care that is equivalent in scope to that provided to active duty military personnel under the DOD military health system. GAO reviewed a sample of seven workers' compensation claims (out of a universe of 83) filed under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act by DOD federal civilians who deployed to Iraq. GAO found in three cases where care was initiated in theater, that the affected civilians had received treatment in accordance with DOD's policies. In all seven cases, DOD federal civilians who requested care after returning to the United States had, in accordance with DOD's policies, received medical examinations and/or treatment for their deployment-related injuries or diseases through either military or civilian treatment facilities. DOD provides certain special pays and benefits to its deployed federal civilians, which generally differ in type and/or amount from those provided to deployed military personnel. For example, both civilian and military personnel are eligible to receive disability benefits for deployment-related injuries; however, the type and amount of these benefits vary, and some are unique to each group. Further, while the survivors of deceased federal civilian and military personnel generally receive similar types of cash survivor benefits, the comparative amounts of these benefits differ."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As the Department of Defense (DOD) has expanded its involvement in  overseas military operations, it has grown increasingly reliant on its  federal civilian workforce to provide support in times of war or national  emergency. In recent years, DOD has undertaken efforts to expand the  use of its civilian workforce to perform combat support functions  traditionally performed by military personnel. Since fiscal year 2004, it has  been in the process of converting thousands of military positions to  civilian positions, with additional conversions planned in the future.  DOD\u2019s 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review Report has acknowledged the  department\u2019s growing dependence on its civilian personnel to support  contingency operations beyond Afghanistan and Iraq.", "However, DOD\u2019s use of its civilian personnel to support military  operations has long raised questions about its policies relating to the  deployment of civilians in support of contingency operations. In 1994, we  reported on the adequacy of DOD\u2019s planning for the future use of civilian  personnel to support military operations in combat areas and noted a  number of problems in deploying civilians to the Gulf War and caring for  them in theater. For example, we noted that many civilians had not been  screened to ensure that they were medically fit to serve in desert  conditions. Thus, some had arrived in the desert with medical and physical  limitations, such as severe heart problems and kidney disorders that  precluded them from effectively performing their duties. Other problems,  while not as grave, indicated a lack of preparation for civilians in theater.  For example, clear procedures did not exist to ensure that civilians  received medical care comparable to that received by military personnel.  In addition, procedures were not in place to provide for overtime or  danger pay that the deployed civilians were eligible to receive. Questions  had also existed concerning whether civilian life insurance policies  contained war exclusion clauses that would preclude survivors of  deceased civilian personnel from receiving accidental death benefits if  civilians were killed while deployed in support of the Gulf War.", "The Senate Armed Services Committee required us to examine DOD\u2019s  policies concerning its federal civilians who deploy in support of  contingency operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. In accordance with that  requirement and agreements with your offices, we examined the extent to  which DOD has established and the military services and one defense  agency (hereafter referred to as DOD components) have implemented   (1) force health protection and surveillance policies for the department\u2019s  deployed federal civilians and (2) medical treatment policies and  procedures for the department\u2019s deployed federal civilians who require  treatment for injuries and diseases. In addition, per your request, we  examined the special pays and benefits provided to DOD\u2019s deployed  federal civilian personnel, including the extent to which these special pays  and benefits differ from those provided to deployed active duty military  personnel. We provided briefings on the preliminary results of our work to  congressional committees in March 2006. This report updates our  preliminary observations and provides further information regarding DOD  federal civilian deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has established force health  protection and surveillance policies for its deployed federal civilians, we  reviewed DOD deployment health requirements for contingency  operations in Afghanistan and Iraq and discussed these policies with the  appropriate DOD officials. Our review focused on DOD federal civilians  who (1) deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq for 30 continuous days or more  between June 1, 2003, and September 30, 2005, and (2) returned to the  United States by February 28, 2006. Because DOD had difficulty  identifying the total number of federal civilians who had deployed to  Afghanistan or Iraq, we assessed the implementation of DOD\u2019s deployment  health requirements at eight component locations that were selected using  a number of approaches. Given that DOD components have flexibility in  where they conduct deployment processing, we selected the locations for  our review accordingly. Specifically, the Army uses a centralized  approach, deploying its federal civilians at three primary locations;  therefore, we selected all three locations for review. By contrast, the Navy  and Air Force use a decentralized approach, deploying their federal  civilians at their home stations. For these components, we selected five  locations based on data which indicated that these locations had deployed  the largest numbers of federal civilian personnel to Afghanistan and Iraq.  Through an informal agreement between DCMA and Army, the Army  processes DCMA\u2019s federal civilians for deployment through two of the  Army\u2019s three deployment locations. Therefore, DCMA deployment data in  this report are included in the Army results to the extent that DCMA  federal civilian deployments were documented at the two relevant Army  locations. At all eight component locations, we reviewed either all  available hard copy or electronic deployment records, or in one instance, a  sample of the deployment records for deployed federal civilian personnel  who met our criteria above. In total, we reviewed hard copies of records  for 454 (out of the reported 822) federal civilian deployments at seven  component locations and electronic records for 2,977 (out of the reported  2,977) federal civilian deployments at the other location where all  deployment records were being maintained electronically. Deployed  federal civilians included in our review may have deployed more than once  during our selected deployment time frame; consequently, there may be  fewer unique civilians than deployments reviewed. The results of these  deployment record reviews, however, could not be projected beyond the  reviewed records to all federal civilians who had deployed during this time  frame. To facilitate our review of federal civilian deployment records at  the selected component locations, we developed a data collection  instrument to review and collect deployment health information from each  individual civilian\u2019s deployment record. After our review of hard copy  deployment records, we requested each component\u2019s medical personnel to  reexamine those hard copy deployment records that were missing  required health documentation, and we adjusted our results where  documentation was subsequently provided. We also obtained and analyzed  other documentation from information systems used by the components  to capture deployment and related health information, making  adjustments to our results where documentation was subsequently found  in the systems. We took steps to assess the reliability of the civilian  deployment and related health data for the purposes of this review,  including consideration of issues such as the completeness of the data  from the respective information systems\u2019 program managers and  administrators. We also examined whether the data were subjected to  quality control measures, such as periodic testing of the data against  deployment records to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data.  In addition, we reviewed existing documentation related to the data  sources and interviewed knowledgeable agency officials about the data.  Although we found these deployment and health data not sufficiently  reliable for (1) identifying the universe of deployed DOD federal civilians  or (2) use as the sole source for reviewing the health and immunization  information for DOD federal civilian deployments, we found the data in  the information systems sufficiently reliable when used as one of several  sources in our review of deployment records. In those instances where we  did not find evidence of a deployment health assessment or immunization  in either the deployment records or in the electronic data systems, we  concluded that the health assessment or immunization was not  documented.", "To determine the extent to which DOD and the selected components had  established medical treatment policies for deployed federal civilian  personnel who required treatment for injuries, illnesses, and diseases, we  analyzed DOD policies and guidance related to defense health care and  discussed these with senior DOD and service surgeon general officials. To  assess the implementation of the policies, we requested all of the workers\u2019  compensation claims that had been filed under the Federal Employees\u2019  Compensation Act by DOD federal civilians who had deployed to  Afghanistan and Iraq. However, our actual review of claims filed by DOD  federal civilian personnel was limited to those who had deployed to Iraq  because the responsible DOD officials were unable to identify the specific  claims that had been filed by those federal civilians who had deployed to  Afghanistan. We selected and reviewed a non-probability sample of  workers\u2019 compensation claims to reflect a range of casualties, including  injuries, physical and mental illnesses, and diseases. The scope of our  review did not extend to the Department of Labor\u2019s claims review process,  which covers the workers\u2019 compensation claims process.", "To determine the types of and differences in special pays and benefits  provided to DOD federal civilian and military personnel who deploy in  support of contingency operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, we examined  the major provisions for special pays and disability and death benefits for  civilian and military personnel, relying primarily on statutes, Department  of State regulations, and DOD guidance. To illustrate how special pays  affected overall compensation provided to DOD federal civilian and  military personnel, we modeled scenarios for both groups based on similar  circumstances, such as pay grades, length of deployment, and special pays.  With regard to disability benefits, we compared benefits provided to DOD  federal civilians for line-of-duty injuries with benefits provided to military  personnel for service-connected injuries, focusing on three main  categories of disability: (1) temporary disability, (2) permanent partial  disability, and (3) permanent total disability. With regard to death benefits,  we primarily reviewed statutes governing both cash and noncash  government-provided benefits. In this report, we do not take a position  regarding the adequacy or appropriateness of the special pays and benefits  provided to DOD federal civilian and military personnel.", "We performed our review from March 2006 through August 2006 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The Defense  Manpower Data Center (DMDC) is responsible for maintaining the  department\u2019s centralized system that currently collects location-specific  deployment information for military servicemembers, such as grid  coordinates, latitude/longitude coordinates, or geographic location codes.  However, DOD has not taken steps to similarly maintain centralized data  on its deployed federal civilians. In addition, DOD had not provided  guidance that would require its components to track and report data on  the locations and movements of DOD federal civilian personnel in theaters  of operations. In the absence of such a requirement, each DOD component  collected and reported aggregated data that identified the total number of  DOD federal civilian personnel in a theater of operations, but each lacked  the ability to gather, analyze, and report information that could be used to  specifically identify individuals at risk for occupational and environmental  exposures during deployments.", "In previously reporting on the military services\u2019 implementation of DOD\u2019s  force health protection and surveillance policies in 2003, we highlighted  the importance of knowing the identity of servicemembers who deployed  during a given operation and of tracking their movements within the  theater of operations as major elements of a military medical surveillance  system. We further noted the Institute of Medicine\u2019s finding that  documentation on the location of units and individuals during a given  deployment is important for epidemiological studies and appropriate  medical care during and after deployments. For example, this information  allows epidemiologists to study the incidences of disease patterns across  populations of deployed servicemembers who may have been exposed to  diseases and hazards within the theater, and health care professionals to  treat their medical problems appropriately. Without location-specific  information for all of its deployed federal civilians and centralized data in  its department-level system, DOD limits its ability to ensure that sufficient  and appropriate consideration will also be given to addressing the health  care concerns of these individuals.", "DOD also had not provided guidance to the components that would  require them to forward completed deployment health assessments for all  federal civilians to the Army Medical Surveillance Activity (AMSA), where  these assessments are suppose to be archived in the Defense Medical  Surveillance System (DMSS), integrated with other historical and current  data on personnel and deployments, and used to monitor the health of  personnel who participate in deployments. The overall success of  deployment force protection and surveillance efforts, in large measure,  depends on the completeness of health assessment data.

The department acknowledged the necessity  for all deployed civilians to receive required medical assessments and  immunizations, and that documentation must be available in every  instance. The department outlined several steps it intends to take to  determine appropriate implementation of our recommendation.  Specifically, the department stated that it has written and coordinated a  new DOD instruction, scheduled to become effective before the end of  2006, that establishes a comprehensive DOD force health protection  quality assurance program that will apply to DOD civilian personnel  accompanying deploying military forces. While DOD\u2019s response is  encouraging, we remain concerned that the department\u2019s description of  the actions it plans to take to assess the components\u2019 compliance with its  requirements lacks sufficient detail. DOD was unable to provide us with a  copy of the new instruction; thus, we could not evaluate the  comprehensiveness of its new force health protection quality assurance  program or determine whether the program identifies specific actions the  department plans to take for assessing and ensuring the full  implementation of the force health protection and surveillance  requirements by all DOD components. DOD also stated that proposed  revisions to its directives and instructions that address the planning,  preparation, and utilization of DOD civilians include, among other things,  annual assessments for compliance with pre-and post-deployment medical  assessment requirements. However, the department did not describe what  actions, if any, it plans to take to ensure that it will be sufficiently  informed of the extent to which its components are complying with  existing health protection requirements for its deployed federal civilians.  In the absence of more specific details on its planned actions, we continue  to emphasize the department\u2019s need for a comprehensive oversight and  quality assurance mechanism without which it will not be effectively  positioned to ensure compliance with its policies, or ensure the health  care and protection of its deployed federal civilians as they continue to  support contingency operations.", "In addition to its comments on our recommendation, the department took  issue with some of our specific findings. DOD questioned our findings that  in many cases DOD components were unable to produce documentation  confirming that deployed federal civilians had received necessary pre- or  post-deployment medical assessments, or immunizations. The department  stated that DOD activities, particularly regarding the Army Corps of  Engineers, Transatlantic Programs Center (TPC), had determined that  documentation did exist for many records included in our review, thus  raising reservations about our findings. In particular, the department  stated that the number (and percent) of records missing two or more  immunizations that we reported for TPC was inaccurate. It stated that  based on TPC\u2019s review of the specific documentation that we used to  support our findings, we had actually identified 69 records (54.3 percent)  as missing two or more immunizations, rather than 85 (66.9 percent) noted  in our draft report. We disagree. TPC overlooked 16 records included in  our review that lacked documentation of any immunizations. Moreover, as  we noted in our report, to provide assurances that the results of our  review of hard copy deployment records at the selected component  locations were accurate, we requested that each component\u2019s designated  medical personnel reexamine those deployment records that we  determined were missing required health documentation. We then  adjusted our results in those instances where documentation was  subsequently provided. To provide additional assurances regarding our  determinations, we requested that each component\u2019s designated medical  personnel review and sign the data collection instrument that we used to  collect deployment health information from each individual civilian\u2019s  deployment record attesting to our conclusions regarding the existence of  health assessment or immunization documentation.", "DOD also stated that we inappropriately mixed discussion of Veterans  Affairs and DOD benefits without distinguishing between the two.  However, our report appropriately discusses two broad categories of  \u201cgovernment-provided\u201d benefits: (1) those provided by DOD and (2) those  provided by VA. Nonetheless, to further clarify this section of our report,  we added \u201cVA\u201d and \u201cDOD\u201d to our discussions of disability compensation  and retirement benefits for military personnel. DOD also stated that our  discussion of military disability benefits presented incorrect information  in many cases, indicating that our statements that compensation payments  for military personnel were based on a disability rating, regardless of  salary level is only true with regard to VA disability benefits. DOD also  stated that DOD disability payments do, in fact, take into account salary  level, and that if a former member is entitled to both, there is an offsetting  mechanism. We agree. As we state in our report, under veterans\u2019  compensation programs, benefits typically include cash payments to  replace a percentage of the individual\u2019s loss in wages while injured and  unable to work. We also state that disability retirement benefits for  military personnel are based on a percent of salary in addition to  compensation benefits, and that the amount of retirement payment is  offset dollar for dollar by the amount of monthly compensation payment  unless military personnel have at least 20 years of service and a disability  rating of 50 percent or more, or have combat-related disabilities.", "Further, DOD submitted detailed comments related to our analysis of  special pays and benefits provided to deployed DOD federal civilian and  military personnel. In particular, the department stated that our selection  and presentation of the associated data on the special pays and benefits  provided to DOD federal civilian and military personnel could easily  mislead the reader into drawing erroneous conclusions. The department  also stated that our comparisons did not take into account the relative  value of certain key benefits for which explicit dollar amounts cannot be  measured, such as retirement systems, health care systems, and military  commissary exchange privileges. To the contrary, our report did discuss  this limitation, and as is the case with any modeled scenarios based on  certain assumptions, some of the factors with the potential to affect the  overall outcomes of our comparisons could not be included because of, as  DOD pointed out, the relative value of certain key benefits for which  explicit dollar amounts cannot be measured. It is partly for this reason that  we acknowledged in the report that we do not take a position on the  adequacy or appropriateness of the special pays and benefits provided to  DOD federal civilian and military personnel. DOD also requested that we  clearly acknowledge the fundamental differences between the military and  civilians systems. We believe that we have done so. As we noted in our  report, we did not make direct analytical comparisons between  compensation and benefits offered by DOD to deployed federal civilian  and military personnel because such comparisons must account for the  demands of the military service, such as involuntary relocation, frequent  and lengthy separations from family, and liability for combat.", "DOD provided other technical comments, which we have incorporated as  appropriate.

Because DOD had difficulty identifying the total number of  federal civilians who deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq, we assessed the  implementation of DOD\u2019s deployment health requirements at eight  component locations that were selected using a number of approaches.  Given that DOD components have flexibility in where they conduct  deployment processing, we selected locations for our review accordingly.  Specifically, the Army uses a centralized approach, deploying its federal  civilians at three primary locations; therefore, we selected all three  locations for review. By contrast, the Navy and Air Force use a  decentralized approach, deploying their federal civilians from their home  stations. For these components, we selected five locations based on data  that indicated that these locations had deployed the largest numbers of  federal civilian personnel. DCMA was included in our review because it  had deployed the largest number of federal civilian personnel compared to  other defense agencies. DCMA has an informal agreement with the Army  to process its federal civilians through two of the Army\u2019s three deployment  locations. Therefore, DCMA federal civilian deployment data in this report  are included in the Army results to the extent that DCMA federal civilian  deployments were documented at the two relevant Army locations. At all  eight component locations, we reviewed either all available hard copy or  electronic deployment records, or in one instance, a sample of the  deployment records for deployed federal civilian personnel who met our  criteria above. Table 11 shows the locations included in our review and the  number of deployment records reviewed at each location.", "In total, we reviewed 3,431 hard copy and automated records for federal  civilian personnel who deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq.

The results of deployment  record reviews, however, could not be projected beyond the samples to all  DOD federal civilians who had deployed during this time frame. To  facilitate our review of federal civilian deployment records at the selected  component locations, we developed a data collection instrument to review  and collect deployment health information from each individual civilian\u2019s  deployment record.", "For federal civilians in our review at each location, we reviewed  deployment records for documentation that the following force health  protection and surveillance policy requirements were met:    Pre-and post-deployment health assessments;    Tuberculosis screening test (within 1 year of deployment);    Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) screening test;    Pre-deployment immunizations:    hepatitis A (first and second course);   influenza (within 1 year of deployment);   tetanus-diphtheria (within 10 years of deployment);   typhoid; and    smallpox (within 5 years of deployment)", "After our review of hard copy deployment records, we requested each  component\u2019s medical personnel to reexamine those hard copy deployment  records that were missing required health documentation, and we adjusted  our results where documentation was subsequently provided. We also  requested and queried other documentation from information systems  used by the components to capture deployment and related health  information, making adjustments to our results where documentation was  found in the systems. These data sources included the Army\u2019s Medical  Protection System (MEDPROS), the Army\u2019s medical database (MedBase),  the Air Force\u2019s Preventive Health Assessment and Individual Medical  Readiness (PIMR) system and its Comprehensive Immunization Tracking  Application (CITA), DOD\u2019s Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting  System (DEERS), which is used by the Navy, and the Army Medical  Surveillance Activity\u2019s Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS).", "At the Army\u2019s Fort Benning, we created a sampling frame (i.e., total  population) of records for 606 federal civilian deployments between June  1, 2003, and September 30, 2005. Our study population was limited to DOD  federal civilians who deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq. We then drew a  stratified random sample of 288 deployment records and stratified the  sample to isolate potential duplicate deployment records for the same  federal civilian. We found two duplicate records and removed them from  both the population and sample, as shown in table 12. We also removed  another 14 deployment records from our sample because those DOD  federal civilians had been deployed to locations other than Afghanistan or  Iraq, and were not eligible for the duty population. In addition, we  removed another 13 deployment records that were originally selected as  potential replacement records; however, we found that those  replacements were not needed.  Ultimately, we identified 238 in-scope  responses, for a weighted response rate of 87 percent. Each sampled  record was subsequently weighted in the analysis to represent all DOD  federal civilians deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq. The disposition of the  federal civilian deployment records we reviewed at Fort Benning are  summarized in the following table: Our probability sample is only one of a large number of samples that we  might have drawn.  Because each sample could have provided different  estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our particular  sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence interval.

We also  examined whether the data were subjected to quality control measures  such as periodic testing of the data against deployment records to ensure  the accuracy and reliability of the data. In addition, we reviewed existing  documentation related to the data sources and interviewed knowledgeable  agency officials about the data. We did not find these deployment and  health data to be sufficiently reliable for (1) identifying the universe of  DOD federal civilian deployments or (2) use as the sole source for  reviewing the health and immunization information for all DOD federal  civilian deployments, but we found the information systems to be  sufficiently reliable when used as one of several sources in our review of  deployment records.

In addition, we discussed the statutes and guidance with  cognizant officials of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness, military services\u2019 headquarters, and the Defense  Contract Management Agency involved with the administration of active  duty and federal civilian personnel entitlements. We did not perform a  comprehensive review of all compensation\u2014comprised of a myriad of  pays and benefits\u2014offered to active duty military and federal civilian  personnel in general. Our analysis focused on selected elements of  compensation such as special pays (e.g., hostile fire/imminent danger pay).  Also, we did not make direct analytical comparisons between  compensation and benefits offered by DOD to deployed federal civilian  and military personnel because such comparisons must account for the  demands of the military service, such as involuntary relocation, frequent  and lengthy separations from family, and liability for combat.", "After reviewing documents and interviewing officials, we then compiled  and analyzed the information on the types and amounts of special pays  and benefits available to active duty military and DOD federal civilian  personnel who deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq. We interviewed DOD  officials to discuss the basis for any differences in compensation. In  addition, to illustrate how special pays affect overall compensation  provided to DOD federal civilian and military personnel, we modeled  scenarios for both groups using similar circumstances, such as length of  deployment, pay grades, special pays (e.g., post differential pay, danger  pay, overtime pay, family separation allowance, basic allowance for  housing, basic allowance for subsistence), and duty location. Through  discussions with senior DOD officials, we made an assumption that  deployed DOD federal civilians worked 30 hours of overtime per week.  For deployed DOD federal civilians, we subtracted a contribution of  $15,000 to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) to obtain the adjusted gross  income. We assumed that DOD federal civilians, temporarily at a higher  tax bracket, would take maximum advantage of the opportunity to defer  taxes. We assumed that the military personnel would contribute a smaller  percentage of pay, 5 percent of gross income, to TSP. We made this  assumption because much of the military pay was not subject to federal  taxes, which removes the incentive to contribute to TSP, and because  unlike for federal workers, military TSP does not have a matching  component. For military personnel, we also deducted the amount of pay  not subject to taxes due to the combat zone exclusion, family separation  allowance, basic allowance for subsistence, and basic allowance for  housing. Using these assumptions, we generated an adjusted gross income  and used that as input into a commercial tax program, Turbo Tax, to  obtain federal taxes owed. We assumed that both DOD federal civilian and  military personnel were married, filing jointly, with a spouse that earned  no income. We assumed that the family had two children and qualified for  two child tax credits, and the Earned Income Tax Credit, if at that income  level. This resulted in four exemptions and a standard deduction of  $10,000 in 2005.
