Alternative financing means such as internal funding, fund raising campaigns, and bank financing options generally were inadequate for significant construction and renovation projects.

Repayment periods typically are 20 to 30 years.", "Municipal bonds are typically divided into two categories: general obligation bonds and revenue bonds. General obligation bonds usually finance public projects and are backed by the taxing authority of the state or local government that issues the bonds; the principal and interest are paid from tax receipts. The principal and interest on revenue bonds, by contrast, are generally paid from income (revenues) produced by the project that the bonds finance. For example, the principal and interest on a revenue bond issued to finance a college dormitory would be paid from fees collected from residents of the dormitory.", "Some municipal bonds issued to finance public projects may not be funded from state appropriations.

Other credit rating firms use similar rating categories.", "Credit rating firms generally consider revenue bonds to have a higher risk of nonpayment than general obligation bonds because revenue bonds are not backed by the taxing authority of the state or local government and usually depend on the project funded to produce sufficient revenues to make interest and principal payments when due. In addition, Standard and Poor\u2019s generally considers hospitals and private colleges and universities to be among the relatively riskier categories of institutions that issue municipal bonds. Private schools lack the backing of any taxing authority, and some of these schools have limited resources.

Through such insurance, an insurer guarantees investors that it will pay the bond interest and principal when due if the issuer defaults. Rating firms that rate bonds also rate bond insurance companies on their ability to pay claims for defaulted interest or principal payments. Consequently, insured bonds are issued with the rating of the insurer rather than the rating of the issuer. Enhancing the quality of a bond in this manner may persuade investors to accept lower interest rates than they might otherwise. The lower interest cost may more than offset the cost to the issuer of obtaining insurance.", "Rating firms use a variety of criteria to evaluate the creditworthiness of bond insurers. They are judged on capital adequacy, which is the amount of capital they have relative to the amount of debt they have insured; their management experience; their underwriting policies; their financial performance; and other organizational factors. The key area in the assessment, however, is capital adequacy.

Nine of the companies, including Connie Lee, are rated AAA by one or more of the major rating firms. The one exception has a AA rating. The municipal bond insurance market is dominated by three insurers that have captured more than 90 percent of the bond insurance market. In 1994, insured municipal bonds totaled about $61 billion, about 37 percent of all municipal bonds that were issued.

Generally, it is not cost-effective to issue bonds of less than $4 million, according to Connie Lee. Costs\u2014such as fees for financial advisers, underwriters, attorneys, credit rating firms, brokers, and others; and insurance premiums\u2014can add substantially to the total cost of a bond. Many schools, especially small schools, either (1) do not need facilities costing millions of dollars or (2) are unwilling or unable to take on debt of that magnitude or to commit to repayment periods of 20 to 30 years.

Structuring support in this way would preclude Connie Lee from violating state licensing requirements for the proportion of debt it insures that must be investment grade, Connie Lee officials suggested.", "A one-time federal subsidy for Connie Lee was yet another suggestion. Although Connie Lee currently has sufficient capital to continue insuring only BBB-rated bonds, it would need considerably more capital to insure bonds rated below BBB, its officials said.

In reaffirming Connie Lee\u2019s rating in May 1995, Standard and Poor\u2019s said Connie Lee\u2019s AAA rating is based on Connie Lee\u2019s very strong ratio of capital resources to insurance in force, stable financial performance, pragmatic strategic and business planning, and proven underwriting practices.", "In Standard and Poor\u2019s May 1995 ranking of the 10 major municipal bond insurers, however, it most often ranked Connie Lee seventh or below in 16 performance categories assessed. But Standard and Poor\u2019s noted that Connie Lee\u2019s rankings, compared with the other companies, reflect that it is (1) a new insurer and, therefore, suffers from the disproportionately high expense base of a start-up company; (2) a small company; and (3) an insurer restricted to the higher-education sector of the bond market.", "During 1992, the first full year that Connie Lee insured bonds, and continuing into 1993, falling interest rates sparked an increase in bond refinancing that caused the volume of municipal bond insurance and profits to surge throughout the bond insurance industry. However, as interest rates increased in 1994, the overall municipal bond and associated insurance volume dropped, as bond refinancing significantly decreased, causing profits to decline industrywide. Connie Lee\u2019s net premiums written declined 36 percent in 1994, after having increased 148 percent in 1992 and decreased 22 percent in 1993. But net premiums written fell 29 percent for municipal bond insurers as a whole in 1994, after having increased 25 percent in 1993.", "Despite this, Connie Lee\u2019s key financial indicators have shown positive trends. As reflected in Connie Lee\u2019s audited financial statements, as of December 31, 1994, Connie Lee\u2019s total insurance in force was $6.6 billion, an increase of 25 percent since December 31, 1992. For the year ended December 31, 1994, Connie Lee\u2019s total revenue was $19.7 million, an increase of 8 percent since the end of 1993. Total revenue had shown an increase of 18 percent during 1993. Net income for 1994 was $8 million, an increase of only 9 percent over 1993, although the increase from 1992 to 1993 was 27 percent. Connie Lee\u2019s total assets rose 3 percent between 1993 and 1994, totaling $225 million on December 31, 1994. Total assets had shown an increase of 13 percent during 1993.", "In 1994, Connie Lee reported its return on equity as 5.6 percent and its return on assets as 3.6 percent. Both indicators rose slightly in 1994, but both are below estimates of the industry averages, as reported by industry analysts, which were 13.7 percent for return on equity and 5.3 percent for return on assets.", "At the end of 1994, Connie Lee held $1 in capital for every $57 of exposure to loss, that is, every $57 it was obligated to pay in case of defaults, whereas the average for the industry as a whole was $1 of capital for every $134 of exposure to loss. Since its inception, Connie Lee has not incurred any losses from bond defaults. However, in 1994, Connie Lee set up a loss reserve of $1.5 million to cover potential losses due to the default of a hospital it reinsured.", "According to Standard and Poor\u2019s and other industry analysts, the amount of capital held by bond insurers is so far in excess of minimum levels required to maintain a AAA rating that it represents a problem for the industry\u2014too much idle capital. Because of the slowdown in the bond market and associated bond insurance business, Standard and Poor\u2019s is urging municipal bond insurers to put unutilized capital to use by opening new lines of business instead of lowering premiums or insuring riskier projects. Among the new lines of business that Standard and Poor\u2019s suggests are investment management services and international insurance.
