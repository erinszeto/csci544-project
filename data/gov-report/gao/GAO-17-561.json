Some barriers to self-employed gig work have been reduced by online platforms, and while the public workforce system is accessible to all job seekers, it is unclear how the system is helping gig workers obtain the necessary skills and training to be successful. GAO was asked to review the skill and training supports needed by gig workers.", "GAO examined (1) what is known about the characteristics of gig workers and the work they perform, including its benefits and downsides, (2) the non-occupational skills and training that stakeholders indicate are needed by gig workers and how they are provided, and (3) the challenges that selected federal agencies and workforce development boards cite in providing supports for gig workers. GAO conducted a literature review and interviewed officials at federal agencies and a nongeneralizable sample of 8 state and 11 local workforce boards\u2014locations selected based on the likelihood of a large number of gig workers, among other factors\u2014and gig company officials, gig workers, researchers, and other stakeholders. GAO also reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Studies GAO reviewed suggest that workers who engage in on-demand, or \u201cgig\u201d work, differ in their characteristics and types of work performed, but each of these defined these workers differently. There is no universally accepted or official definition of gig workers; but, for its report, GAO has identified their characteristics as follows: self-employed individuals providing labor services and completing single projects or tasks on demand for pay. Gig work can be obtained or performed either offline or online. According to the three quantitative studies GAO reviewed, up to about 40 percent of workers earning money through online gig work (i.e., applications or websites that connect workers with customers) were 34 years old or younger. They worked in a variety of occupations ranging from providing legal services to moving furniture. According to stakeholders GAO interviewed, benefits of gig work included flexibility in scheduling and autonomy, while downsides included a lack of financial security and benefits, such as health and unemployment insurance.", "According to stakeholders, gig workers need soft skills and business skills, many of which can be provided by the Department of Labor's (DOL) existing programs. Soft skills include customer service, time management, and self-motivation, and business skills include marketing and financial literacy and management. In addition, gig workers need an understanding of legal matters (e.g., contracts) associated with gig work. The nation's public workforce system, including workforce boards, which DOL oversees, and other partners can provide some of these self-employment skills based on local area needs. Officials at the local workforce boards GAO interviewed said they served gig workers either directly, for example, through recruitment events and by providing career services, or indirectly, such as through general self-employment services. For instance, the Chicago board recruited drivers for a ridesharing company and the San Francisco board helped gig workers in the media and visual arts develop their portfolios and build their networks.", "Officials from selected state and local workforce boards cited two broad challenges in providing supports for gig workers: a lack of information on promising practices related to gig workers and difficulties in reporting their employment-related outcomes. Officials from all 19 state and local boards GAO interviewed expressed interest in other boards' efforts to serve gig workers. DOL shares promising practices through its searchable online portal, but has not fully linked \u201cgig\u201d and related terms to relevant information on self-employment. Helping boards easily find and share promising practices relevant to gig workers would allow boards that want to help gig workers to do so more fully and efficiently. State and local board officials also explained that it is challenging to verify employment and earnings outcomes for the self-employed as they are required to do under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA). Because these outcomes for gig workers may be difficult to verify, a board's performance under WIOA may be negatively affected and result in penalties. Consequently, DOL officials said workforce boards had asked for guidance on collecting outcome information. In June 2017, DOL issued clarifying guidance to boards on how to collect information that can be used to report outcomes required under WIOA."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOL take steps to help workforce boards find and share information on promising practices related to serving gig workers.

More  recently, however, companies offering work through online platforms have  made gig work more accessible, lowering the entry and operating costs  for workers who want or need to supplement or replace more traditional  work. For example, in the past a freelancer might have needed to build a  client base through advertising or referrals, but now online platforms can  facilitate this process with workers beginning a project or task very  quickly. While gig work may bring new opportunities, it may also bring  challenges. Because gig workers are self-employed, they might not  receive employer-provided benefits, such as retirement or health  insurance, or be covered by other safeguards, such as job-protected  leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.", "With this new ease of entry into gig work, it is unclear whether workers  have the appropriate skills and training to be successful.

Although other definitions have been used to measure the number of gig  workers, our focus was on the non-occupational skills and training  needed by workers who participate in gig work. We characterized gig  workers as being self-employed and who participate in gig work part-time  or full-time. However, not all self-employed individuals are gig workers.  For example, we did not consider self-employed individuals who own their  own storefront business, such as a restaurant owner, as gig workers  because they do not generally work on a project basis. However, our  characterization would include a caterer who works on a project basis  with multiple clients.

Programs administered by DOL and Education provide  services such as job search assistance, career counseling, occupational  skills training, classroom training, and on-the-job training. In addition,  WIOA provides for a workforce system that is accessible to all job  seekers to make it easier for them to access the services they need to  obtain skills and employment. Basic career services include eligibility  determinations, initial skill assessments, and program referrals. WIOA  also provides for state workforce development boards (state boards) to  help oversee a system of over 550 local workforce development boards  (local boards) that, in turn, deliver services through a network of over  2,400 American Job Centers. Under WIOA, state and local boards have  the flexibility to respond to the needs of their local labor markets, which  they do, in part, through the analysis of local labor market information.", "Federal funding under WIOA for core programs is allocated to states  using statutory formulas that, in part, generally reflect state and local  unemployment data. According to DOL, in program year 2017, total  appropriated funding for activities related to Adult and Dislocated Worker  programs and Wagner-Peyser Employment Services was more than $2.7  billion. Local boards may also leverage other funding sources, such as  DOL discretionary grants and state and local government funding, among  other sources.", "WIOA included new performance measures for states and local areas  generally related to participants who exit WIOA programs. These include  the percentage of participants employed in unsubsidized employment in  the second and fourth quarters after program exit, and median earnings in  unsubsidized employment in the second quarter after exit, among other  measures. Generally, performance outcome targets are negotiated  between DOL\u2019s regional offices and state workforce boards and take into  consideration the characteristics of the job seekers being served as well  as the local labor market conditions. Both states and local areas are  subject to certain consequences for failing to achieve their negotiated  targets. To support performance outcomes, states must use, consistent  with state law, quarterly wage records to verify participants\u2019 employment  and earnings. States typically satisfy this requirement by using their  Unemployment Insurance (UI) wage record data. Earnings from self- employment, however, are generally not included in state UI wage  records because self-employed workers are not considered to be in  employment that is covered by the unemployment insurance system. In  these cases, boards are allowed to use supplemental wage information\u2014 for example, case management notes, administrative records, and  surveys of participants, among other things\u2014to support employment and  earnings outcomes.", "DOL has long encouraged workforce boards to provide entrepreneurship  and self-employment training by funding several projects and grants to  demonstrate the role of the workforce development system in this area  (see table 1).", "DOL also provides technical assistance to workforce boards through  online training, other training events, and its WorkforceGPS website.

Further, officials from one board that works with short- term contractors in the information technology field said it can be  challenging for U.S. workers to make sufficient pay from work obtained  through professional online platforms because workers face global  competition from those in other countries who are willing to do the same  work for less pay. Similarly, lack of financial security was a concern  among workers in three of our four discussion groups who said low or  unpredictable income was a downside, and this factor was also  mentioned by two of the gig companies we interviewed. workers said they have performed work using an online platform for which  they did not receive payment.", "All stakeholder groups we interviewed said the lack of employer-provided  benefits\u2014such as health insurance, unemployment insurance, vacation  pay, and sick pay, among other benefits\u2014was a downside to gig work.

This knowledge is important because according to one  stakeholder we interviewed, drivers for ridesharing companies are  building their own business, but some do not realize the consequences of  engaging in this type of work. Further, officials from one local workforce  board said because barriers to engaging in gig work are low, workers may  enter into this type of work before knowing how to manage their self- employment or understanding its ramifications.

They said gig work is not as viable in the long run for  workers who do not have the necessary technical skills. As a result, they  could remain caught in lower-skilled gig work even though their ultimate  goal might be to develop a career.

In the past, we reported a lower level of  tax compliance by self-employed individuals than by employees. Even  workers who understand that they need to pay their own taxes but then  fail to plan appropriately could face paying a large amount in taxes at the  end of the year.

For example, a gig company official said  that some of its gig workers have asked to speak to the company\u2019s  human resources manager when they have an issue even though the  company considers them to be self-employed business owners. The  official said the company has to remind these workers that they are not  represented by the company\u2019s human resources department. Further, the  Pew Research Center study found that an estimated 26 percent of gig  workers who used online platforms considered themselves to be  employees of the platform they used to find work.

Gig workers need to understand  they are selling their skills, or, in other words, are in the \u201cbusiness of you,\u201d  and how they present themselves online can affect their opportunities,  said one official from an organization that helps low-income workers  navigate the gig economy. Accurate cost estimating and pricing were also  considered to be important. A gig company official said that pricing is a  skill that involves including all expenses, while leaving room for profit and  accounting for some risk.", "Not all workers may be suited for gig work even when provided training in  these skills, according to officials from one workforce board. Using a DOL  Workforce Innovation Fund grant, this board provided a program to help  workers become self-employed and engage in gig work. Board officials  said about 30 to 50 percent of the participants leave the program because  they decide that this type of work is not for them. These officials said they  consider this a positive outcome because the training helps participants  recognize the challenges of self-employment before taking steps that  might have long-term consequences, such as using their life savings to  start a business."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Workforce Boards and SBA Programs Provide Self- Employment Skills and Training for Gig Workers Based on Perceived Local Area Needs", "paragraphs": ["The 11 local workforce boards we interviewed all served gig workers in  some way. In some cases, local workforce boards directly provided  services to gig workers, and in other cases they indirectly provided  services to gig workers through efforts that more broadly targeted workers  in specific sectors or who were engaged or interested in self-employment  (see fig. 1). Direct services ranged from recruitment to career services,  including providing job coaching and workshops on finding gig work and  developing self-employment skills. Overall, officials from 9 of the 11  boards described these efforts as responses to perceived needs in their  local labor markets.", "Among the selected boards that offered workshops, several covered  similar information related to self-employment. The most common topics  included (1) marketing strategies, such as the use of social media; (2)  financial management, including pricing and tax implications; and (3) the  basics of contracting. In addition, one of New York City\u2019s workshops  provided information on the legal aspects of participating in gig work,  and Gainesville\u2019s provided information on obtaining work through online  platforms.", "Selected boards also provided indirect support services that were not  specifically targeted to gig workers but served populations that could  include them. For example, Miami\u2019s construction sector initiative did not  specifically train workers for gig work, but the skills it supported could be  applied to gig work in the construction industry, according to officials.  The Seattle board provided self-employment workshops on starting or  growing a small business and marketing that were not specifically  designed for gig workers but could help them obtain gig work, or involved  skills that are transferable to gig work, according to board officials.  Furthermore, Seattle has a tool that can help individuals determine how  much income is needed to be self-sufficient in their local area, which  could also be helpful for individuals engaging in gig work.", "The selected boards\u2019 activities varied in the degree to which they focused  on those enrolled in WIOA programs. Some board activities, such as  recruitment events for ride-sharing services in Chicago and Dallas, were  open to the community, including WIOA participants. In Chicago, the  workforce board recruited job seekers for a ridesharing company, and  some of them then used this work as an income source while they  received WIOA services, scheduling it around their WIOA training  activities, according to board officials. In Northern Virginia, by contrast, all  participants in the board\u2019s self-employment initiative were enrolled in  WIOA.", "Boards varied in their practices for listing gig work at job centers. Officials  from five local boards said that their job centers could list opportunities  with gig companies, but they were not always sure if the job centers did  so. State and local board officials in two states, however, cited federal  and state provisions as the reason why they required a traditional  employer-employee relationship to list jobs at their job centers. DOL  officials said that the department does not set requirements for the types  of jobs that states can post in their job centers, other than certain  nondiscrimination requirements. They said that states might impose  their own limitations, but most states aim to increase the number of  businesses listing jobs with their job centers.", "While officials from all local boards that we interviewed said they provided  services to gig workers either directly or indirectly, some nonetheless  raised concerns about placing job seekers in gig work, questioning the  appropriateness of this type of work under WIOA. Specifically, officials  from some local boards said they saw their primary mission under WIOA  as helping job seekers with barriers to employment find traditional work  rather than task- or project-based work that may lack benefits or job  security. Additionally, an official from one local board said that using  WIOA training funding for services for gig workers would not be a good  use of taxpayer dollars because the ultimate goal for job seekers is  permanent employment. In addition, officials from five local boards noted  that their staff may not be prepared to share information about gig work  opportunities or may be uncomfortable doing so. Because of these  concerns, officials from one state and one local board said that serving  self-employed workers would require a change in \u201cmindset\u201d on the part of  the workforce system as local boards may be cautious about offering  such services.", "Officials from other boards, some of which were not included in our  analysis of board services for gig workers, expressed interest in studying  the gig economy.

Officials at two Small Business Development Centers and a  Women\u2019s Business Center said that the centers provide workshops,  counseling, and referrals at no or low cost and are serving gig workers.

This  learning center also includes a forum where gig workers can post  questions, share advice, and network with each other. Officials at an  online platform company that allows professional gig workers to access  and perform projects said that they provide information on pricing and tax  filing as well as a suite of business tools to help these gig workers track  tax payments and number of hours billed. Company officials said that  they provide this service to address gaps in information that hindered  these workers in the past, such as documenting a steady income for the  purposes of obtaining a mortgage. An official at a ridesharing company  said that it has partnered with other organizations to provide information  to help drivers, for example, by helping them understand their tax filing  obligations and save for retirement. Nongovernmental organizations have  also played other roles in supporting training for gig workers.

Officials from all of the state boards we interviewed said that they lacked  labor market information on gig workers. An official with one local  workforce board said that getting good, reliable data about who is looking  for gig work is a challenge. If boards do not have these data, it could be  difficult for them to determine the prevalence of gig workers in the local  labor market and to design services for them. Officials from the local  workforce boards that undertook specific efforts to serve gig workers said  that they did so because they perceived that gig workers were important  to the local labor market (e.g., technology workers in San Francisco and  media and entertainment workers in New York City) or because the local  area faced high levels of unemployment and under-employment (e.g.,  Gainesville, Florida). Officials from most local boards we interviewed  said that their job centers had not necessarily seen much interest in gig  work, which, in their opinion, could be a reflection of the fact that clients  are typically seeking traditional employment, are unaware of the gig  economy, or may not see job centers as the appropriate place to obtain  gig work, among other reasons.

Linking \u201cgig\u201d and related terms to  self-employment may be particularly important because DOL officials  indicated that recent and soon-to-be issued evaluations from self- employment initiatives funded through the Workforce Innovation Fund  grants may yield information relevant to gig workers.
