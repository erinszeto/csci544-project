CBP inspectors at ports of entry are responsible for the primary inspection of travelers to determine their admissibility into the United States and to enforce laws related to preventing the entry of contraband, such as drugs and weapons of mass destruction. Our investigation was conducted at Congressional request as a result of widespread congressional and public interest in the security of our nation's borders, given today's unprecedented terrorism threat environment.

We will also provide our observations regarding  the procedures that CBP inspectors followed when the radiation portal  monitors detected such material. We are releasing a detailed report today  with corrective action briefings to CBP and the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission (NRC) on the results of our undercover border crossing  tests.", "We selected two land ports of entry that had radiation portal monitors  installed: one at the U.S.-Canadian border and one at the U.S.-Mexican  border. Radiation portal monitors are large pieces of stationary equipment  that CBP uses as part of its overall strategy to thwart radiological  terrorism by detecting the presence of radioactive sources by screening  people, vehicles, and cargo as they pass through ports of entry. In order to  safely plan and execute our undercover operation, several of our  investigators attended training at the National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Our investigators received  training on the safe handling, storage, and transport of radioactive  sources.", "When considering the type of radioactive sources to use in our undercover  operation, we decided to use one of the most common radioisotopes used  in industry for its strong radioactivity and also used in medical therapy to  treat cancer. After consulting with an outside expert, we used an amount  of radioactive sources that we determined was sufficient to manufacture a  dirty bomb. A dirty bomb would most likely result in small radiation  exposures and would typically not contain enough radiation to kill people  or cause severe illnesses. However, by scattering the radioactive material,  the dirty bomb has the effect of contaminating an area. The extent of local  contamination depends on several factors, including the size of the  explosive, the amount and type of radioactive material used, and weather  conditions. While there could be an increase in the cancer risk among  those exposed to radiation from a dirty bomb, the more significant effect  of a dirty bomb could be the closing of contaminated areas. The direct  costs of cleanup and the indirect losses in trade and business in the  contaminated areas could be large. Hence, dirty bombs are generally  considered to be weapons of mass disruption instead of weapons of mass  destruction.", "As part of our investigation, we purchased a small quantity of the  radioactive sources from a commercial source by posing as an employee  of a fictitious company. This was to demonstrate that anyone can purchase  small quantities of radioactive sources for stockpiling because suppliers  are not required to exercise due diligence to determine whether the buyer  has a legitimate use for the radioactive sources and suppliers are not  required to ask the buyer to produce an NRC document when making  purchases in small quantities. We then deployed two teams of  investigators to the field to make simultaneous border crossings at the  northern and southern borders in an attempt to transport radioactive  sources into the United States.", "While making our simultaneous crossings, we focused our investigation on  whether the radiation portal monitors would detect the radioactive  sources we carried and whether CBP inspectors exercised due diligence to  determine the authenticity of paperwork presented by individuals  attempting to transport radioactive sources across our borders. Although  we offer observations on the procedures that CBP inspectors followed for  our two border crossings, we did not evaluate the adequacy of the design  or effectiveness of those procedures. Our investigation also tested whether  an NRC document could be counterfeited using data easily accessible and  available to the public.
