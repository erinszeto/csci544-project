A cost estimate is a forecast, and as  such, there is always a chance that the actual cost will differ from the  estimate. Uncertainty is the indefiniteness about the outcome of a  situation. Uncertainty is assessed in cost estimate models to estimate  the risk (or probability) that a specific funding level will be exceeded.  We found the Bureau performed an uncertainty analysis on a portion  of the estimate to determine whether estimated costs were realistic  and to establish the probability of achieving projections outlined in the  estimate. The Bureau used a combination of modeling based on  Monte Carlo analysis and allocations of funding for risks. The Monte  Carlo simulation was performed on a portion of the estimate to  account for uncertainty around various operational parameters for  which a range of outcomes was possible, including Internet response  rates and the extent to which data collection issues might be resolved  using administrative records.

According to the Bureau, cross- checks were not performed because the Bureau considered the  independent cost estimates as overall cross-checks on the reliability  of their methodology and did not conduct additional cross-checks.

Changes in assumptions for expected self- response rates contributed to increases in the response category, as  the assumed rate decreased from 63.5 percent in 2015 to 60.5  percent in 2017, thereby increasing the anticipated percentage and  associated cost of nonresponse follow-up. When the Bureau does  not receive responses by mail, phone, or Internet, census  enumerators visit each nonresponding household to obtain data.  Thus, reduced self-response rates lead to increases in the amount of  data collected in the field, which is more costly to the Bureau. Bureau  officials attributed this decrease to a forecasted reduction in Internet  response due to added authentication steps at log in and the  elimination of the function allowing users to save their responses and  return later to complete the survey.", "Productivity rates. The productivity of enumerators collecting data  for NRFU is another variable in the cost estimate that was updated,  contributing to cost increases in the response category. Expected  productivity rates for NRFU decreased from the 2015 estimate of 4  attempts per hour to 2.9. According to Bureau documentation, this  more conservative estimate is based on historical data, rather than  research and test data.", "In-office address canvassing rates. The Bureau will not go door-to- door to conduct in-field address canvassing across the country to  update address and map information for every housing unit, as it has  in prior decennial censuses. Rather, some areas would only need a  review of their address and map information using computer imagery  and third-party data sources\u2014what the Bureau calls \u201cin-office\u201d  address canvassing procedures. However, in March 2017, citing  budget uncertainty the Bureau decided to discontinue one of the  phases of in-office review address canvassing for the 2020 Census.  The cancellation of that phase of in-office review is expected to  increase the number of housing units canvassed in-field by 5 percent  (from 25 to 30 percent of all canvassed housing units). In-field  canvassing is more labor intensive compared to in office procedures.  The 2017 version of the cost estimate reflects this increase in  workload for in-field address canvassing, though overall changes in  estimated costs for the Frame category, of which Address Canvassing  is a part, were minimal.", "Staffing.

The Bureau  developed some of its contingency based on proven risk management  techniques, including Monte Carlo analysis and allocated funding for  known risk scenarios.

For both objectives we reviewed  documentation from the Bureau on the 2020 life-cycle cost estimate and  interviewed Bureau and Department of Commerce officials.", "For the first objective, we relied on our Cost Estimating and Assessment  Guide as criteria. Our cost specialists assessed measures consistently  applied by cost-estimating organizations throughout the federal  government and industry and considered best-practices for developing  reliable cost estimates.

The cost estimate should include both government  and contractor costs of the program over its full life-cycle, from  inception of the program through design, development, deployment,  and operation and maintenance to retirement of the program. It should  also completely define the program, reflect the current schedule, and  be technically reasonable. Comprehensive cost estimates should be  structured in sufficient detail to ensure that cost elements are neither  omitted nor double counted. Specifically, the cost estimate should be  based on a product-oriented work breakdown structure (WBS) that  allows a program to track cost and schedule by defined deliverables,  such as hardware or software components.

Finally, the  documentation should include evidence that the cost estimate was  reviewed and accepted by management.", "Accurate. The cost estimate should provide for results that are  unbiased, and it should not be overly conservative or optimistic. An  estimate is accurate when it is based on an assessment of most likely  costs; adjusted properly for inflation; and contains few, if any, minor  mistakes. In addition, a cost estimate should be updated regularly to  reflect significant changes in the program\u2014such as when schedules  or other assumptions change\u2014and actual costs, so that it is always  reflecting current status. During the update process, variances  between planned and actual costs should be documented, explained,  and reviewed. Among other things, the estimate should be grounded  in a historical record of cost estimating and actual experiences on  other comparable programs.", "Credible. The cost estimate should discuss any limitations of the  analysis because of uncertainty or biases surrounding data or  assumptions. Major assumptions should be varied, and other  outcomes recomputed to determine how sensitive they are to changes  in the assumptions. Risk and uncertainty analysis should be  performed to determine the level of risk associated with the estimate.
