This documentation included the  amount of income reported for lobbying activities, the amount of  expenses reported, the houses of Congress or federal agencies lobbied,  lobbying issue areas, and the names of lobbyists listed in the report. We  also reviewed whether lobbyists listed on the LD-2 reports properly  disclosed prior covered official positions, and whether the lobbyists filed  the semiannual report of federal political contributions. Two lobbying firms  in our sample, Fierce Government Relations and Cardinal Infrastructure,  declined to meet with us following our initial letter, sent in September  2017. After multiple follow up contacts in October and November 2017,  we informed both firms that because they declined to meet, we would  supply their names to Congress, as provided for in HLOGA.

It was last revised January 31, 2017,  to (among other issues) update the registration threshold to reflect  changes in the Consumer Price Index, and clarify the identification of  clients and covered officials and issues related to rounding income and  expenses.

To  assess whether these disclosure data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report, we reviewed relevant documentation and  consulted with knowledgeable officials. Although registrations and reports  are filed through a single web portal, each chamber subsequently  receives copies of the data and follows different data-cleaning,  processing, and editing procedures before storing the data in either  individual files (in the House) or databases (in the Senate). Currently,  there is no means of reconciling discrepancies between the two  databases caused by the differences in data processing. For example,  Senate staff told us during previous reviews they set aside a greater  proportion of registration and report submissions than the House for  manual review before entering the information into the database. As a  result, the Senate database would be slightly less current than the House  database on any given day pending review and clearance.", "House staff told us during previous reviews that they rely heavily on  automated processing. In addition, while they manually review reports  that do not perfectly match information on file for a given lobbyist or client,  staff members approve and upload such reports as originally filed by each  lobbyist, even if the reports contain errors or discrepancies (such as a  variant on how a name is spelled). Nevertheless, we do not have reasons  to believe that the content of the Senate and House systems would vary  substantially. Based on interviews with knowledgeable officials and a  review of documentation, we determined that House disclosure data were  sufficiently reliable for identifying a sample of quarterly disclosure reports  (LD-2) and for assessing whether newly filed lobbyists also filed required  reports. We used the House database for sampling LD-2 reports from the  third and fourth quarters of 2016 and the first and second quarters of  2017, as well as for sampling year-end 2016 and midyear 2017 political  contributions reports (LD-203). We also used the database for matching  quarterly registrations with filed reports. We did not evaluate the Offices  of the Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of the House, both of which  have key roles in the lobbying disclosure process. However, we did  consult with officials from each office. They provided us with general  background information at our request.", "To assess the extent to which lobbyists could provide evidence of their  compliance with reporting requirements, we examined a stratified random  sample of 98 LD-2 reports from the third and fourth quarters of 2016 and  the first and second quarters of 2017. The sample size of 98 LD-2  reports for this year\u2019s review represents an increase from the sample size  selected for the 2015 and 2016 reviews, and is a return to the sample  size selected in reviews prior to 2015. We increased the sample size  because, in 2016, we observed a change in the estimate of the  percentage of reports that had documentation of income and expenses  (83 percent down from 92 percent in 2015). At that time, we were unable  to state that this was a statistically significant change because, in part, the  reduced sample size of 80 did not give us enough power to detect and  report on the change of that size. We excluded reports with no lobbying  activity or with income or expenses of less than $5,000 from our sampling  frame. We drew our sample from 45,818 activity reports filed for the third  and fourth quarters of 2016 and the first and second quarters of 2017  available in the public House database, as of our final download date for  each quarter.", "Our sample of LD-2 reports was not designed to detect differences over  time. However, we conducted tests of significance for changes from 2010  to 2017 for the generalizable elements of our review. We found that  results were generally consistent from year to year and there were few  statistically significant changes after using a Bonferroni adjustment to  account for multiple comparisons. For this year\u2019s review, we identified  that the estimated change in the percent of LD-2 reports that provided  written documentation for the income and expenses from 2016 to 2017 is  notable. In recent years, our findings show some variation in the estimate  percentage of reports with documentation. Specifically, our estimate for  2017 (99 percent) represents a statistically significant increase from 2016.  These changes are identified in the report. The inability to detect  significant differences from year to year in our results may be related to  sampling error alone or the nature of our sample, which was relatively  small and was designed only for cross-sectional analysis.", "Our sample is based on a stratified random selection and is only one of a  large number of samples that we may have drawn. Because each sample  could have provided different estimates, we express our confidence in the  precision of our particular sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence  interval. This interval would contain the actual population value for 95  percent of the samples that we could have drawn. The percentage  estimates for LD-2 reports have 95 percent confidence intervals of within  plus or minus 12 percentage points or fewer of the estimate itself.", "We contacted all the lobbyists and lobbying firms in our sample and,  using a structured web-based survey, asked them to confirm key  elements of the LD-2 and whether they could provide written  documentation for key elements in their reports, including  the amount of income reported for lobbying activities;  the amount of expenses reported on lobbying activities;  the names of those lobbyists listed in the report;  the houses of Congress and federal agencies that they lobbied, and  the issue codes listed to describe their lobbying activity.", "After reviewing the survey results for completeness, we interviewed  lobbyists and lobbying firms to review the documentation they reported as  having on their online survey for selected elements of their respective LD- 2 report.", "Prior to each interview, we conducted a search to determine whether  lobbyists properly disclosed their covered position as required by the  LDA. We reviewed the lobbyists\u2019 previous work histories by searching  lobbying firms\u2019 websites, LinkedIn, Leadership Directories, Legistorm, and  Google. Prior to 2008, lobbyists were only required to disclose covered  official positions held within 2 years of registering as a lobbyist for the  client. The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007  amended that time frame to require disclosure of positions held 20 years  before the date the lobbyists first lobbied on behalf of the client. Lobbyists  are required to disclose previously held covered official positions either on  the client registration (LD-1) or on an LD-2 report. Consequently, those  who held covered official positions may have disclosed the information on  the LD-1 or a LD-2 report filed prior to the report we examined as part of  our random sample. Therefore, where we found evidence that a lobbyist  previously held a covered official position, and that information was not  disclosed on the LD-2 report under review, we conducted an additional  review of the publicly available Secretary of the Senate or Clerk of the  House database to determine whether the lobbyist properly disclosed the  covered official position on a prior report or LD-1. Finally, if a lobbyist  appeared to hold a covered position that was not disclosed, we asked for  an explanation at the interview with the lobbying firm to ensure that our  research was accurate.", "In previous reports, we reported the lower bound of a 90 percent  confidence interval to provide a minimum estimate of omitted covered  positions and omitted contributions with a 95 percent confidence level.  We did so to account for the possibility that our searches may have failed  to identify all possible omitted covered positions and contributions. As we  have developed our methodology over time, we are more confident in the  comprehensiveness of our searches for these items. Accordingly, this  report presents the estimated percentages for omitted contributions and  omitted covered positions, rather than the minimum estimates. As a  result, percentage estimates for these items will differ slightly from the  minimum percentage estimates presented in prior reports.", "In addition to examining the content of the LD-2 reports, we confirmed  whether the most recent LD-203 reports had been filed for each firm and  lobbyist listed on the LD-2 reports in our random sample. Although this  review represents a random selection of lobbyists and firms, it is not a  direct probability sample of firms filing LD-2 reports or lobbyists listed on  LD-2 reports. As such, we did not estimate the likelihood that LD-203  reports were appropriately filed for the population of firms or lobbyists  listed on LD-2 reports.", "To determine if the LDA\u2019s requirement for lobbyists to file a report in the  quarter of registration was met for the third and fourth quarters of 2016  and the first and second quarters of 2017, we used data filed with the  Clerk of the House to match newly filed registrations with corresponding  disclosure reports. Using an electronic matching algorithm that includes  strict and loose text matching procedures, we identified matching  disclosure reports for 2,995, or 87.2 percent, of the 3,433 newly filed  registrations. We began by standardizing client and lobbyist names in  both the report and registration files (including removing punctuation and  standardizing words and abbreviations, such as \u201ccompany\u201d and \u201cCO\u201d).  We then matched reports and registrations using the House identification  number (which is linked to a unique lobbyist-client pair), as well as the  names of the lobbyist and client.", "For reports we could not match by identification number and standardized  name, we also attempted to match reports and registrations by client and  lobbyist name, allowing for variations in the names to accommodate  minor misspellings or typos. For these cases, we used professional  judgment to determine whether cases with typos were sufficiently similar  to consider as matches. We could not readily identify matches in the  report database for the remaining registrations using electronic means.", "To assess the accuracy of the LD-203 reports, we analyzed stratified  random samples of LD-203 reports from the 30,594 total LD-203 reports.  The first sample contains 80 reports of the 9,474 reports with political  contributions and the second contains 80 reports of the 20,335 reports  listing no contributions. Each sample contains 40 reports from the year- end 2016 filing period and 40 reports from the midyear 2017 filing period.  The samples from 2017 allow us to generalize estimates in this report to  either the population of LD-203 reports with contributions or the reports  without contributions to within a 95 percent confidence interval of within  plus or minus 11 percentage points or fewer. Although our sample of LD- 203 reports was not designed to detect differences over time, we  conducted tests of significance for changes from 2010 to 2017 and found  no statistically significant differences after adjusting for multiple  comparisons.", "While the results provide some confidence that apparent fluctuations in  our results across years are likely attributable to sampling error, the  inability to detect significant differences may also be related to the nature  of our sample, which was relatively small and designed only for cross- sectional analysis. We analyzed the contents of the LD-203 reports and  compared them to contribution data found in the publicly available  Federal Elections Commission\u2019s (FEC) political contribution database. We  consulted with staff at FEC responsible for administering the database.  We determined that the data are sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  our reporting objectives.", "We compared the FEC-reportable contributions on the LD-203 reports  with information in the FEC database. The verification process required  text and pattern matching procedures so we used professional judgment  when assessing whether an individual listed is the same individual filing  an LD-203. For contributions reported in the FEC database and not on  the LD-203 report, we asked the lobbyists or organizations to explain why  the contribution was not listed on the LD-203 report or to provide  documentation of those contributions. As with covered positions on LD-2  disclosure reports, we cannot be certain that our review identified all  cases of FEC-reportable contributions that were inappropriately omitted  from a lobbyist\u2019s LD-203 report. We did not estimate the percentage of  other non-FEC political contributions that were omitted because they tend  to constitute a small minority of all listed contributions and cannot be  verified against an external source.", "To identify challenges to compliance, we used a structured web-based  survey and obtained the views from 88 different lobbying firms included in  our sample on any challenges to compliance. The number of different  lobbying firms is 88, which is less than our original sample of 98 reports  because some lobbying firms had more than one LD-2 report included in  our sample. We calculated responses based on the number of different  lobbying firms that we contacted rather than the number of interviews.  Prior to our calculations, we removed the duplicate lobbying firms based  on the most recent date of their responses. For those cases with the  same response date, the decision rule was to keep the cases with the  smallest assigned case identification number. To obtain their views, we  asked them to rate their ease with complying with the LD-2 disclosure  requirements using a scale of \u201cvery easy,\u201d \u201csomewhat easy,\u201d \u201csomewhat  difficult,\u201d or \u201cvery difficult.\u201d In addition, using the same scale we asked  them to rate the ease of understanding the terms associated with LD-2  reporting requirements.", "To describe the resources and authorities available to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s  Office for the District of Columbia (USAO) and its efforts to improve its  LDA enforcement, we interviewed USAO officials. We obtained  information on the capabilities of the system officials established to track  and report compliance trends and referrals and on other practices  established to focus resources on LDA enforcement. USAO provided us  with reports from the tracking system on the number and status of  referrals and chronically noncompliant lobbyists and lobbying firms.", "The mandate does not require us to identify lobbyists who failed to  register and report in accordance with the LDA requirements, or  determine for those lobbyists who did register and report whether all  lobbying activity or contributions were disclosed. Therefore, this was  outside the scope of our audit.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2017 to March 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
