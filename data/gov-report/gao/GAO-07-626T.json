Because about 85 percent of the nation's critical infrastructure is owned by the private sector, it is vital that the public and private sectors work together to protect these assets. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for coordinating a national protection strategy including formation of government and private sector councils as a collaborating tool. The councils, among other things, are to identify their most critical assets, assess the risks they face, and identify protective measures, in sector-specific plans that comply with DHS's National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP). This testimony is based primarily on GAO's October 2006 sector council report and a body of work on cyber critical infrastructure protection. Specifically, it addresses (1) the extent to which these councils have been established, (2) key facilitating factors and challenges affecting the formation of the council, (3) key facilitating factors and challenges encountered in developing sector plans, and (4) the status of DHS's efforts to fulfill key cybersecurity responsibilities. GAO has made previous recommendations, particularly in the area of cybersecurity that have not been fully implemented. Continued monitoring will determine whether further recommendations are warranted."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["To better coordinate infrastructure protection efforts as called for in the NIPP, all 17 critical infrastructure sectors have established their respective government councils, and nearly all sectors have initiated their voluntary private sector councils. But council progress has varied due to their characteristics and level of maturity. For example, the public health and healthcare sector is quite diverse and collaboration has been difficult as a result; on the other hand, the nuclear sector is quite homogenous and has a long history of collaboration. As a result, council activities have ranged from getting organized to refining infrastructure protection strategies. Ten sectors, such as banking and finance, had formed councils prior to development of the NIPP and had collaborated on plans for economic reasons, while others had formed councils more recently. As a result, the more mature councils could focus on strategic issues, such as recovering after disasters, while the newer councils were focusing on getting organized. Council members reported mixed views on what factors facilitated or challenged their actions. For example, long-standing working relationships with regulatory agencies and within sectors were frequently cited as the most helpful factor. Challenges most frequently cited included the lack of an effective relationship with DHS as well as private sector hesitancy to share information on vulnerabilities with the government or within the sector for fear the information would be released and open to competitors. GAO's past work has shown that a lack of trust in DHS and fear that sensitive information would be released are recurring barriers to the private sector's sharing information with the federal government, and GAO has made recommendations to help address these barriers. DHS has generally concurred with these recommendations and is in the process of implementing them. All the sectors met the December 2006 deadline to submit their sector-specific plans to DHS, although the level of collaboration between the sector and government councils on the plans, which the NIPP recognizes as critical to establishing relationships between the government and private sectors, varied by sector. Issuing the NIPP and completing sector plans are only first steps to ensure critical infrastructure is protected. Moving forward to implement sector plans and make progress will require continued commitment and oversight. While DHS has initiatives under way to fulfill its many cybersecurity responsibilities, major tasks remain to be done. These include assessing and reducing cyber threats and vulnerabilities and coordinating incident response and recovery planning efforts. Effective leadership by the Assistant Secretary for Cyber Security and Telecommunications is essential to DHS fulfilling its key responsibilities, addressing the challenges, and implementing recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for inviting us to participate in today\u2019s hearing on infrastructure  protection issues. The nation\u2019s critical infrastructures and key resources\u2014 including those cyber and physical assets essential to national security,  national economic security, and national public health and safety\u2014have  been and continue to be vulnerable to a wide variety of threats. In 2005,  Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, damaging critical  infrastructure such as oil platforms, pipelines, and refineries; water mains;  electric power lines; and cellular phone towers. The chaos resulting from  this infrastructure damage disrupted the functioning of government and  business alike and produced cascading effects far beyond the physical  location of the storm. In 2004, authorities discovered a plan to target  financial institutions in New York, and in 2005 suicide bombings struck  London\u2019s public transportation system, disrupting the city\u2019s transportation  and mobile telecommunications infrastructure. Because the private sector  owns approximately 85 percent of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure\u2014 such as banking and financial institutions, telecommunications networks,  and energy production and transmission facilities\u2014it is vital that the  public and private sectors form effective partnerships to successfully  protect these assets.", "A key player in these partnerships is the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS). The Homeland Security Act of 2002 created DHS and gave it wide- ranging responsibilities for leading and coordinating the overall national  critical infrastructure protection effort. The act required DHS to develop a  comprehensive national plan for securing the nation\u2019s critical  infrastructures and recommend measures to protect key resources.  Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) further defined  critical infrastructure protection responsibilities for DHS and those federal  agencies given responsibility for particular industry sectors, such as  transportation, energy, and telecommunications, known as sector-specific  agencies. DHS is to establish uniform policies, approaches, guidelines, and  methodologies to help ensure that critical infrastructure within and across  the 17 infrastructure sectors is protected, and is to use a risk management  approach to coordinate protection efforts. This includes using risk  assessments to set priorities for protective measures by the department;  sector-specific agencies; tribal, state, and local government agencies and  authorities with critical assets and resources in their jurisdiction, owners  and operators of these assets; and other entities.", "HSPD-7 required DHS to develop a comprehensive and integrated plan by  December 2004 that outlines national protection goals, objectives,  milestones, and key initiatives necessary to fulfilling these responsibilities.  In response, DHS developed the National Infrastructure Protection Plan  (NIPP). Issued in June 2006, the NIPP is a base plan that is to serve as a  road map for how DHS and other relevant stakeholders should use risk  management principles to prioritize protection activities within and across  sectors in an integrated, coordinated fashion. In particular, the NIPP  required the individual sector-specific agencies, working with relevant  government and private sector representatives, to submit plans to DHS by  the end of December 2006 that would establish the means by which the  sectors will identify their critical assets, assess risks of terrorist attacks or  other hazards on them, assess and prioritize those which have national  significance, and develop protective measures for the sector. DHS is to use  these individual plans to evaluate whether any gaps exist in the protection  of critical infrastructures on a national level and, if so, to work with the  sectors to address the gaps. defense industrial base; drinking water and water treatment systems; emergency services;  energy; government facilities; information technology; national monuments and icons;  postal and shipping; public health and health care; telecommunications; and transportation  systems.

We reported then that the ability to share  security-related information is critical and necessary because it can unify  the efforts of federal, state, and local government agencies and the private  sector in preventing or minimizing terrorist attacks. In April 2006, we  reported that DHS continued to face challenges that impeded the private  sector\u2019s willingness to share sensitive security information with the  government. In this report, we assessed the status of DHS efforts to  implement the protected critical infrastructure information (PCII)  program created pursuant to the Homeland Security Act. This program  was specifically designed to establish procedures for the receipt, care, and  storage of critical infrastructure information voluntarily submitted to the  government. We found that while DHS created the program office,  structure, and guidance, few private sector entities were using the  program. Challenges DHS faced included being able to assure the private  sector that such information will be protected and specifying who will be  authorized to have access to the information, as well as to demonstrate to  critical infrastructure owners the benefits of sharing the information. We  concluded that if DHS were able to surmount these challenges, it and  other government users may begin to overcome the lack of trust that  critical infrastructure owners have in the government\u2019s ability to use and  protect their sensitive information. We recommended that DHS better  define its critical infrastructure information needs and better explain how  this information will be used. DHS concurred with our recommendations.  In September 2006 DHS issued a final rule that established procedures  governing the receipt, validation, handling, storage, marking, and use of  critical infrastructure information voluntarily submitted to DHS.", "Four government and four sector council representatives stated that the  lack of prior working relationships either within their sector or with the  federal government created challenges in forming their respective  councils.

According to the sector- specific agency representative of the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS), historically, there was relatively little collaboration on  critical infrastructure protection-related issues among sector members.  Despite these reported challenges, the public health and health care sector  has been able to form a sector council that is in the early stages of  organization. The commercial facilities sector, which also involves varied  and often unrelated stakeholders nationwide, similarly reported that the  disparities among stakeholders made forming a council challenging. This  sector encompasses owners and operators of stadiums, raceways, casinos,  and office buildings that have not previously worked together. In addition,  the industries composing the commercial facilities sector did not function  as a sector prior to the NIPP and did not have any prior association with  the federal government.

According to some of these representatives, it is impossible and cost- prohibitive to try to protect every asset from every possible threat.  Instead, industries in these sectors prefer to invest resources in protecting  the most critical assets with the highest risk of damage or destruction and  to plan for recovering quickly from an event.

For example, DHS had established working  groups to facilitate coordination among government and industry  infrastructure officials and fostered exercises in which government and  private industry could practice responding to cyber events, but many of its  efforts lacked time frames for completion and the relationships among its  various initiatives are not evident.", "DHS faces a number of challenges that have impeded its ability to fulfill its  cybersecurity responsibilities, including establishing effective partnerships  with stakeholders, achieving two-way information sharing with  stakeholders, demonstrating the value it can provide to private sector  infrastructure owners, and reaching consensus on DHS\u2019s role in Internet  recovery and on when the department should get involved in responding  to an Internet disruption. In addition, we reported that DHS faced a  particular challenge in attaining the organizational stability and leadership  it needed to gain the trust of other stakeholders in the cybersecurity  world\u2014including other government agencies as well as the private sector.", "In July 2005, DHS undertook a reorganization that established the position  of the Assistant Secretary of Cyber Security and Telecommunications\u2014in  part to raise the visibility of cybersecurity issues in the department. In  September 2006, DHS announced the appointment of an Assistant  Secretary for Cyber Security and Telecommunications. Since the  appointment, the Assistant Secretary has led efforts to ensure the  inclusion of cybersecurity in each critical infrastructure sector\u2019s sector  specific plan. The Assistant Secretary has set priorities that include (1)  preparing for and deterring attacks by encouraging entities, through  implementation of the sector specific plans, to systematically assess their  network vulnerabilities and take steps to fix them, (2) responding to cyber  attacks of potentially national significance by leveraging operational  expertise and building situational awareness and incident response  capabilities of the government and private sector; and (3) building  awareness about the responsibilities for securing networks across the  public and private sectors.", "In addition to the National Cyber Security Division, the Assistant Secretary  is also responsible for the National Communications System, which  ensures continuity of communications and priority service for the  government under conditions of national emergency, and the Office of  Emergency Communications, established pursuant to the fiscal year 2007  DHS appropriations act. This office is responsible for developing a  national strategy and technical assistance and outreach to state and local  governments for ensuring operable and interoperable emergency  communications capabilities for first responders.", "To strengthen DHS\u2019s ability to implement its cybersecurity responsibilities  and to resolve underlying challenges, GAO has made about 25  recommendations over the last several years. These recommendations  focus on the need to (1) conduct important threat and vulnerability  assessments, (2) develop a strategic analysis and warning capability for  identifying potential cyber attacks, (3) protect infrastructure control  systems, (4) enhance public/private information sharing, and (5) facilitate  recovery planning, including recovery of the Internet in case of a major  disruption. DHS concurred with most of the recommendations addressed  to them. Together, the recommendations provide a high-level road map for  DHS to use in working to improve our nation\u2019s cybersecurity posture.  While DHS has made progress in addressing some of these  recommendations many things remain to be done. Until it addresses these  recommendations, DHS will have difficulty achieving results in its role as  the federal focal point for the cybersecurity of critical infrastructures\u2014 including the Internet. Table 3 shows our detailed recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Critical infrastructure protection is vital to our national security, economic  vitality, and public health. Yet a decade after focusing on improving our  ability to protect our key assets and resources, progress has been mixed,  as Katrina demonstrated. It showed that significant damage to critical  infrastructure and key resources could disrupt the functioning of  businesses and government alike, underscoring the need for the private  and public sector to establish stronger partnerships and working  relationships in order to take a coordinated approach to critical  infrastructure protection. DHS has moved out by issuing the National  Infrastructure Protection Plan as a guiding framework for a national effort,  and is providing contractor, technical, and analytical support to sectors,  among other things, to encourage progress. Likewise, some sectors\u2014those  who are more mature, have been regulated, are more homogeneous, or  had economic incentives, such as the threat of Y2K\u2014came together to  collaborate, work effectively, and develop protection strategies, even  before DHS established the national plan. But other sectors\u2014those who  have just been created, who have not worked with federal agencies in the  past, who are not regulated but must volunteer to participate in the  planning process, and who are large and diverse\u2014face bigger challenges  in achieving this coordination and rate of progress. Despite these  challenges, each sector submitted a protection plan to DHS. However,  DHS has yet to release them. Given the wide variance in the maturity of  the sectors, the quality, comprehensiveness, completeness, and  consistency of the plans remain to be seen. In addition, it is important to  realize that in some cases, the sector specific plan is really more of a first  step\u2014a \u201cplan to plan.\u201d In other words, the sectors were only to describe  how they expect to identify and prioritize critical assets, how they expect  to assess their risks, vulnerabilities, threats and consequences, and how  they will approach developing protection programs, not detail how they  will implement them.", "Thus, fulfilling its statutory responsibilities for ensuring the nation\u2019s  critical infrastructure is protected will be a long-term commitment for  DHS. This makes it even more important that DHS address challenges that  our work has identified over the years and for which we have made a  number of recommendations yet to be implemented, including our body of  work assessing the protection of cyber infrastructure. These challenges  include building trusted working relationships and better collaborating  with states and localities, given that the infrastructure is in their  communities, as well as the private sector, given that they own most of the  assets and resources. Challenges also include providing the environment  and incentives for the private sector to voluntarily share information with  DHS on gaps in vulnerabilities and protective measures, information that  the agency must have to be able to ensure assets and resources critical to  the nation are protected. Challenges also include providing organizational  stability and leadership, addressing employee turnover and gaps in  expertise, and enhancing agency capabilities, such as for providing  analysis and warning and identifying and assessing threats and  vulnerabilities.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
