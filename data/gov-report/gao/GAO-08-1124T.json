Reasons offered for changing the existing system focus primarily on the difficulties of adjudicating matters of federal law arising in American Samoa, principally based on American Samoa's remote location, and the desire to provide American Samoans more direct access to justice. Reasons offered against any changes focus primarily on concerns about the effects of an increased federal presence on Samoan culture and traditions and concerns about juries' impartiality given close family ties. During the mid-1990s, several proposals were studied and many of the issues discussed then, such as the protection of local culture, were also raised during the GAO study. Based on previous studies and information gathered for its June 2008 report, GAO identified three potential scenarios, if changes were to be made: (1) establish a federal court in American Samoa under Article IV of the U.S. Constitution, (2) establish a district court in American Samoa as a division of the District of Hawaii, or (3) expand the federal jurisdiction of the High Court of American Samoa. Each scenario would present unique issues to be addressed, such as what jurisdiction to grant the court. The potential cost elements for establishing a federal court in American Samoa include agency rental costs, personnel costs, and operational costs, most of which would be funded by congressional appropriations. Exact details of the costs to be incurred would have to be determined when, and if, any of the scenarios were adopted. The controversy surrounding whether and how to create a venue for adjudicating matters of federal law in American Samoa is not principally focused on an analysis of cost effectiveness, but other policy considerations, such as equity, justice, and cultural preservation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss Federal Court Options for  American Samoa.

According to American  Samoa Department of Commerce data, in 2005, the population of  American Samoa was about 65,500. Unlike residents born in CNMI, Guam,  and USVI, residents born in American Samoa are nationals of the United  States, but many become naturalized U.S. citizens. Like residents of the  other insular areas, residents of American Samoa have many of the rights  of citizens of the 50 states, but cannot vote in U.S. national elections and  do not have voting representation in the final approval of legislation by the  full Congress. According to Census Bureau data for 2000, the median  household income in American Samoa was $18,200, less than half of the  U.S. median household income of almost $41,000.", "American Samoa does not have an organic act that formally establishes its  relationship with the United States. Two deeds of cession were initially  completed between Samoan chiefs, or matai, and the United States in  1900 and 1904 and ratified by the federal government in 1929. In these  deeds, the United States pledged to promote peace and welfare, to  establish a good and sound government, and to preserve the rights and  property of the people. The U.S. Navy was initially responsible for federal  governance of the territory. Then, in 1951, federal governance was  transferred to the Secretary of the Interior, which continues today. The  Secretary exercises broad powers with regard to American Samoa,  including \u201call civil, judicial, and military powers\u201d of government in  American Samoa. American Samoa has had its own constitution since  1960, and since 1983, the local American Samoa constitution may only be  amended by an act of Congress.", "The American Samoa Constitution provides for three separate branches of  government\u2014the executive, the legislative, and the judicial. Since 1977, a  popularly elected Governor heads the American Samoa executive branch  for 4-year terms. Nearly 40 American Samoa departments, offices, and  other entities within the executive branch of the American Samoa  government provide public safety, public works, education, health,  commerce, and other services. The Governor has responsibility for  appointing the Attorney General, Director of Public Safety, and other  executive branch agency leaders. The legislature, or Fono, is comprised of  18 senators and 20 representatives. Each of the senators is elected in  accordance with Samoan custom by the city councils of the counties that  the senator represents. Each of the representatives is popularly elected  from the representative districts. American Samoa exercises authority  over its immigration system through its own locally adopted laws. In fiscal  year 2007, a total of almost $105 million in federal funds were provided  from a variety of federal agencies, including the Departments of the  Interior, Education, Agriculture, Transportation, and Health and Human  Services.

The trial division, which consists of the Chief Justice,  the Associate Justice, and associate judges, is a court of general  jurisdiction, empowered to hear, among other things, felony cases and  civil cases in which the amount in controversy exceeds $5,000. The Chief  Justice and the Associate Justice are appointed by the U.S. Secretary of  the Interior and are required to be trained in the law. There are six  associate judges, who are appointed by the Governor and are not required  to have formal legal training. The associate judges are matai, or chiefs,  and they preside over cases in the High Court, playing a more significant  role in deciding issues of matai titles and land. There is one local district  court judge, who is appointed by the Governor and must also have formal  legal training, who hears matters, such as misdemeanor criminal offenses  and civil cases in which the matter in controversy does not exceed  $5,000.

Prior to 1999, FBI officials told us  that allegations of criminal activity in American Samoa were investigated  by agents based in its Washington, D.C. field office and, due to the  distance and costs involved, very few investigations were initiated. Around  mid-1999, FBI began to assign Hawaii-based agents to investigations in  American Samoa in response to increasing reports of criminal activity.  Then, due to growing caseload and a crime assessment, in December 2005,  FBI opened a resident agency in American Samoa.

We recommended,  among other things, that the Secretary of the Interior coordinate with  other federal agencies to designate the American Samoa government as a  high-risk grantee until it completed all delinquent single audits. In June  2005, DOI designated the American Samoa government as a high-risk  grantee. The American Samoa government subsequently completed all  overdue audits and made efforts to comply with single audit act  requirements. Later, in December 2006, we reported that insular area  governments, including American Samoa, face serious economic, fiscal,  and financial accountability challenges and that their abilities to  strengthen their economies were constrained by their lack of  diversification in industries, scarce natural resources, small domestic  markets, limited infrastructure, and shortages of skilled labor. Again, we  cited the long-standing financial accountability problems in American  Samoa, including the late submission of the reports required by the Single  Audit Act, the inability to achieve unqualified (\u201cclean\u201d) audit opinions on  financial statements, and numerous material weaknesses in internal  controls over financial reporting and compliance with laws and  regulations governing federal grant awards. We made several  recommendations to the Secretary of the Interior, including increasing  coordination activities with officials from other federal grant-making  agencies on issues such as late single audit reports, high-risk designations,  and deficiencies in financial management systems and practices. DOI  agreed with our recommendations, but we have not yet assessed its  progress toward implementing them.", "In addition to these GAO reviews, FBI and various inspector general  agents have conducted a broad investigation into federal grant-related  corruption in American Samoa, which yielded guilty pleas in October 2005  from four former American Samoa government officials, including the  Director of Procurement, the Director of the Department of Education, the  Director of the Department of Health and Social Services, and the Director  of the School Lunch Program. Additionally, recent audits and  investigations by the Inspector General offices of the Departments of  Homeland Security, Education, and the Interior indicate that the American  Samoa government has inadequate controls and oversight over federal  funds, that federal competitive bidding practices have been circumvented,  and that American Samoan officials have abused federal funds for  personal benefit. For example, in September 2007, officials from the U.S.  Department of Education designated the American Samoa government as  a high-risk grantee due to serious internal control issues raised in previous  single audits, and cited a number of underlying fiscal and management  problems. Due to the department\u2019s concerns about the American Samoa  government\u2019s ability to properly administer and provide services with its  funds, the department imposed several special conditions, including  restrictions on the drawdown of grant funds. Also, the American Samoa  legislature, or Fono, has been assisting federal agencies in their efforts to  investigate public corruption and other crimes. Specifically, in early 2007,  the Fono established a Senate Select Investigative Committee to review  and investigate any unlawful, improper, wasteful, or fraudulent operations  involving local and federal funds or any other misconduct involving  government operations within all departments, boards, commissions,  committees, and agencies of the American Samoa government. An official  stated the committee reviews and investigates complaints, holds senate  hearings with relevant witnesses, and can refer cases to either the  American Samoa Attorney General or FBI for investigation and  prosecution."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reasons Offered for Changing the Current System Focus Principally on the Difficulties of Adjudicating Matters of Federal Law and Greater Access to Justice", "paragraphs": ["As was the case in the 1990s, and was repeated in the interviews we  conducted and e-mail comments we received, the reasons offered for  changing the American Samoa judicial system principally stem from  challenges associated with adjudicating matters of federal law arising in  American Samoa and the desire to provide American Samoans with  greater access to justice. Federal law enforcement officials have identified  a number of issues that limit their ability to pursue matters of federal law  arising in American Samoa. These include logistical challenges related to  American Samoa\u2019s remote location. Proponents of changing the judicial  system of American Samoa also cite reasons, such as providing American  Samoans more direct access to justice as in other insular areas, serving as  a possible deterrent to crime, and providing a means to alleviate the  shame, embarrassment, and costs associated with being taken away to be  tried more than 2,000 miles from American Samoa. While the main areas of  concern in the mid-1990s and in our discussions were related to criminal  matters arising in American Samoa, there were also concerns regarding  civil matters, such as federal debt collection, although these were not  addressed in much detail."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Logistical Challenges Related to American Samoa\u2019s Remote Location", "paragraphs": ["Without a federal court in American Samoa, investigators and federal  prosecutors whom we interviewed said they were limited in their ability to  conduct investigations and prosecute cases due to logistical obstacles  related to working in such a remote location.

In some cases, search warrants or wiretaps were not  used by the prosecutors to the extent that they would have been if  American Samoa were in closer proximity to Washington, D.C. or  Honolulu, Hawaii. Federal prosecutors told us that far fewer witnesses  have been called to testify in front of the grand jury, given the burden of  high travel costs from American Samoa. Federal prosecutors also told us  that they must rely on witness observations and summaries from federal  agents stationed in American Samoa rather than meet key witnesses face  to face before bringing charges or issuing subpoenas, as they would  typically do. Further, according to DOJ officials, the cost related to  managing these cases has limited the number of cases they are able to  pursue. Federal law enforcement agents told us that a federal court  located in American Samoa could bring additional investigative and  prosecutorial resources so that they would be able to pursue more cases.

Currently, the ability to  adjudicate federal cases exists only in very limited cases through the High  Court, at a significant cost of time and money to travel to U.S. District  Courts in Hawaii or Washington, D.C.; or not at all, in the case of some  civil matters and bankruptcy. Proponents state that the establishment of a  federal court would provide American Samoa parity with other insular  areas, such as CNMI, Guam, and USVI, which have federal courts. Further,  a legal expert said that a federal court in American Samoa would provide  the community with an opportunity to see first hand how parties can come  together to resolve their differences with regard to federal matters. For  example, some have asserted that if public corruption trials were held in  American Samoa, they would act as a deterrent to others contemplating  fraudulent behavior; increase accountability with regard to government  spending; and provide satisfaction in witnessing wrong doers brought to  justice. Some stated in the February 2006 public hearing held by the Fono  and in e-mail comments we received that they have felt shame and  embarrassment when defendants are taken to distant courts and in our  group discussions, it was stated that American Samoa is perceived by  others as unable to render justice to its own residents. Further, some  officials have noted the significant costs that defendants\u2019 families must  bear in traveling great distances to provide support during trials.

This issue had also been discussed in the  mid-1990s. For example, in his testimony during August 1995  congressional hearings, the then-Governor of American Samoa stated that  the people of American Samoa have the ability to deliver just verdicts  based on the evidence presented.

As noted above, matai hold positions of  authority in the community; for example, only matai may serve as  senators in the American Samoa legislature, and matai control the use and  development of the communal lands and allocate housing to their  extended family members. The land tenure system of American Samoa is  such that the majority of the land in American Samoa is communally  owned, and the sale or exchange of communally owned land is prohibited  without the consent of the Governor. Also prohibited is the sale or  exchange of communally owned and individually owned property to  people with less than one-half Samoan blood.

This division is composed of the Chief Justice and Associate Justice, as  well as associate judges, who are appointed based on their knowledge of  Samoan culture and tradition. Pursuant to the federalist structure of the  U.S. judiciary, if a federal court were established in American Samoa, most  cases arising under local law, such as matai and land disputes, would  likely continue to be heard by the local court. However, some American  Samoa officials stated that they are concerned that if a federal court was  established in American Samoa, a federal judge, without the requisite  knowledge of Samoan culture and tradition, would hear land and title  cases. They stated that they would like to keep matai title and land tenure  issues within the jurisdiction of the High Court.", "Another concern that was raised by government officials and residents of  American Samoa is that the presence of a federal court in American Samoa  may generate constitutional challenges to the matai and land tenure  system.

Another possibility is that, as in other insular area  federal courts, the federal jurisdiction of the court could grow over time.

They point out that they designated judges from the Ninth Circuit to the  District of Guam for over 2 years, when there was an extended judge  vacancy. Further, the Ninth Circuit has designated local judges to handle  federal matters, when necessary. For example, the judges from the  Districts of CNMI and Guam routinely use local Superior Court or  Supreme Court judges to handle federal court matters and trials, in cases  when they must recuse themselves from a court matter or in the case of a  planned or emergency absence.

At the  same time, as it is unprecedented to give federal criminal jurisdiction to a  local court, this scenario could face the most challenges of the three,  according to federal judges and other judicial officials. Legal experts with  whom we met told us that, because this is a unique arrangement, the High  Court and U.S. judiciary may be faced with having to constantly solve  unique problems and develop solutions on a regular basis. For example,  judicial officials stated that the High Court Justices would have to be  cognizant of their roles and responsibilities when shifting from the duties  of a local High Court Justice to the duties of a federal judge. A judicial  official also noted that the High Court justices may have to become  familiar with federal sentencing guidelines, which require a considerable  amount of training. In the August 1995 hearing, the DOJ Deputy Assistant  Attorney General stated that vesting federal jurisdiction in the High Court  runs counter to well-established legislative policy that district courts  should have exclusive jurisdiction over certain types of proceedings to  which the United States is a party. For example, federal law states that  U.S. district courts have exclusive jurisdiction over all offenses against the  criminal laws of the United States and with respect to the collection of  debts owed to the United States, provides for an exclusive debt collection  procedure in the courts created by Congress. Similarly, federal regulatory  statutes often provide for enforcement and judicial review in the federal  courts.", "Another issue to be resolved is the appointment process for justices of the  High Court.

For example, any cost increases associated with the condition  of an unknown site or escalation in construction costs beyond what has  been anticipated will have a direct and proportional impact on the rental  costs, as well as the up-front costs that agencies may be required to pay.", "Preliminary rental costs of $80 to $90 per square foot for a new courthouse  with specialized building requirements would exceed typical federal  government rental charges for offices in American Samoa at the prevailing  market rates of $45 to $50 per rentable square foot in 2007."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Judicial Branch Costs Include Judges, Court Staff, and Federal Defender", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Scenario 1 Costs", "paragraphs": ["District court costs: For yearly district court costs under scenario 1,  AOUSC provided us with district court cost estimates of about $1.5 million  for personnel costs, including the costs of one district court judge and the  full-time equivalent salaries of 2 law clerks and 1 secretary, 11 district  clerk\u2019s office staff, 1 pro se law clerk, 1 court reporter, and recruitment  and training costs.
