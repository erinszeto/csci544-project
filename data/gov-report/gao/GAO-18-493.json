As satellites have become  more complex, they have required larger investments of money and time  to develop, produce, and launch. Some satellites, which have taken more  than a decade to develop due in part to their size and complexity, contain  technologies that are obsolete by the time they are launched. Additionally,  in recent years, threats to DOD space systems have emerged, including  anti-satellite weapons, communications jamming, and increased  environmental hazards in space, such as orbital debris.

Both the  2010 National Space Policy and the 2013 National Space Transportation  Policy call on federal agencies to explore the use of inventive,  nontraditional arrangements for acquiring commercial space services.  One such arrangement is to place a government payload\u2014such as a  sensor or a communications package\u2014on a commercial host satellite. In  addition to launching with the host satellite, the hosted payload uses  available resources from the host satellite, such as power and  communication systems. The hosted payload approach allows both the  government and commercial entity to capitalize on shared development  and launch costs, potentially reducing overall costs for both.

A commercially hosted DOD payload is a DOD payload  on a commercial satellite. In general, hosted payloads may be either  experimental or operational. Experimental payloads demonstrate new or  existing technologies on orbit for potential use on future operational space  systems. Operational payloads deliver required capabilities to end users.  Hosted payload arrangements may be unsuitable for some missions. For  example, some payloads may be too large or need too much power for a  host satellite to feasibly accommodate, or may require unique satellite  maneuvers that, if exercised, would negatively affect a host satellite\u2019s  primary mission.

Recent strategic  and policy guidance government-wide and at DOD have stressed the  need for U.S. space systems to be survivable, or resilient, against  intentional and unintentional threats\u2014both types of which have  increased over the past 20 years. Intentional threats can include  purposeful signal jamming, laser dazzling and blinding of satellite  sensors, missiles intended to destroy satellites, and ground system  attacks. Some unintentional threats to satellites are created by the  harsh space environment itself, like extreme temperature fluctuations  and radiation, and the growing number of satellites, used rocket parts,  and other space debris on orbit, which could collide with orbiting  satellites.", "Continual technology upgrades and industrial base stability\u2014 New technologies may be continually incorporated into space systems  using hosted payloads, which may be uniquely suited for higher rates  of production and launches than traditional DOD satellites.

DOD has been looking at ways to break up  larger satellites into multiple smaller satellites or payloads after decades  of building large, complex satellites to meet its space-based  requirements. The broader concept of breaking up larger satellites into  smaller ones is known as disaggregation. In 2014, we reported that DOD  lacked critical knowledge about the concept of disaggregation, including  how to quantify a broad range of potential effects. At the time, for  example, DOD did not have common measures for resilience, which we  found is a key consideration in making a choice as to whether to continue  with a current system architecture or to change it. Recently, senior DOD  officials have also made public statements that indicate a willingness to  consider innovative acquisition approaches so that acquisition timelines  can be reduced. For example, in a 2016 strategic intent document, the  Commander of Air Force Space Command stated that the Air Force  should seek innovative acquisition approaches that leverage DOD\u2019s  buying power across the industry.

Spectrum is a natural resource used to provide essential  government functions and missions ranging from national defense,  weather services, and aviation communication, to commercial services  such as television broadcasting and mobile voice and data  communications. The frequencies, or frequency bands, of spectrum have  different characteristics that make them more or less suitable for specific  purposes, such as the ability to carry data long distances or penetrate  physical obstacles. Each frequency band has a limited capacity to carry  information. This means that multiple users operating at approximately  the same frequency, location, and time have the potential to interfere with  one another. Harmful interference occurs when two communication  signals are either at the same frequencies or close to the same  frequencies in the same vicinity, a situation that can lead to degradation  of a device\u2019s operation or service.

Some DOD officials added  that the process for all new satellites from initial filing to ITU approval  takes around 7 years. If a satellite owner registers for one frequency band  of spectrum and later requires a different band, the owner has to begin  the registration process from the beginning\u2014restarting the 7-year  timeline.

As  mentioned previously, the Hosted Payload Office is developing a hosted  payload data interface unit to mitigate this challenge by securing payload  data communications from the host satellite."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Department-wide Information on Commercially Hosted Payloads Is Limited and Fragmented Across Offices", "paragraphs": ["DOD, at the department-wide level, has limited information on  commercially hosted payloads\u2014mostly due to a lack of experience in  using hosted payloads and complexities associated with them. For  example, acquisition officials in the Office of the Secretary of Defense told  us that DOD needs more data and analysis of the potential costs and  benefits. However, realistic cost modeling for commercially hosted DOD  payloads is unavailable because costs can vary across potential hosts  and DOD has minimal experience using commercial hosts. Similarly, the  HPO performs market research and cost estimates based on data from  commercial companies, but according to one official in the HPO, the costs  tend to vary based on the supply and demand in the commercial satellite  industry. Additionally, HPO officials said their cost savings analyses are  based on only two real-world commercially hosted DOD payloads\u2014 CHIRP and REACH. HPO officials told us that with additional  government data they could compare the costs of system architectures  that include free-flier satellites with those that use commercially hosted  payloads. Additionally, some potential benefits of using commercially  hosted payloads, such as resilience, may be difficult to measure. In our  2014 report on disaggregation, we recommended that DOD define key  measures related to disaggregation, including developing metrics to  measure resilience. DOD is in the process of developing standard  metrics for resilience.", "DOD\u2019s knowledge of commercially hosted payloads is also fragmented  across the agency. Several DOD offices are independently conducting  activities related to commercially hosted payloads, such as pursuing  commercially hosted payload arrangements, developing lessons learned,  and determining demand for commercial hosts. For example, MDA  officials told us they have developed cost and technical data and lessons  learned based on MDA\u2019s Spacebased Kill Assessment payload\u2014 launched earlier this year\u2014but have not shared it across the agency. On  the other hand, the Space Test Program, also housed within the Air  Force\u2019s SMC develops lessons learned on its payloads, which are  government payloads on government host satellites and officials there  told us they provide lessons learned to the HPO. In October 2017,  SMC\u2019s Launch Office sent a request for data on hosted payloads to DOD  agencies, research laboratories, and universities, but the HPO was not an  active participant in this request. Independent efforts within DOD to  collect and analyze cost, schedule, and performance results from hosted  payloads can create fragmentation in DOD\u2019s knowledge base and can  increase the risk of duplicative efforts within DOD.", "DOD does not collect or consolidate agency-wide knowledge on  commercially hosted payloads and has no plans to do so. Agency officials  stated that DOD does not require programs outside of SMC to consult the  HPO when seeking commercially hosted payload arrangements. The Air  Force established the HPO to facilitate commercially hosted payloads,  however, the 2011 Program Management Directive that established the  HPO states that the HPO will coordinate with SMC directorates for  detailed implementation of hosted payloads but does not address  coordination with agencies or directorates outside of SMC. According to  an HPO official, programs are not required to use HPO expertise or tools  as they pursue using hosted payloads. Further, this official stated that  programs are not required to provide any data or lessons learned to the  HPO, or any other central point within DOD, following the pursuit or  completion of a hosted payload arrangement. The 2011 Program  Management Directive directs the HPO to provide lessons learned to  SMC directorates but does not direct SMC offices to share information\u2014 such as costs, technical data and lessons learned on completed  commercially hosted payload efforts\u2014with the HPO. An HPO official  indicated that the HPO obtains data through informal communication with  those programs using hosted payloads that are willing to share data.", "We found that limitations and fragmentation of data and knowledge are  contributing to resistance within DOD to using hosted payloads. Several  DOD acquisition and program officials we spoke with who did not have  experience with hosted payloads generally stated that the potential risks  to using hosted payloads outweighed the benefits, and that there was  little evidence-based analysis to prove otherwise. They were not aware of  existing tools that could assist them in making decisions even though the  HPO has been developing these tools and has made efforts to share  them within SMC. DOD acquisition and program officials consistently  cited a preference for maintaining the acquisition status quo over  introducing any perceived added risk to their programs. At the same time,  however, officials who have used hosted payloads were able to overcome  logistical and technical challenges and realize cost savings. However,  according to an HPO official, there is currently no requirement in place to  facilitate sharing their approaches to doing so. We have reported in the  past that DOD\u2019s culture has generally been resistant to changes in space  acquisition approaches and that fragmented responsibilities for  acquisitions have made it very difficult to coordinate and deliver  interdependent systems.", "Moreover, our past studies of commercial strategic sourcing best  practices have found that that leading companies centralize procurement  decisions by aligning, prioritizing, and integrating procurement functions  within the organization. Establishing the Hosted Payload Office is one  step in this direction, but the office is organized under the Advanced  Systems and Development Directorate\u2014a research and development  organization\u2014under SMC. Moreover, the 2011 directive that established  the HPO does not address coordination or responsibilities for agencies or  directorates beyond SMC. Consolidating knowledge is important because  it allows organizations to share information and data upon which to  develop consistent procurement tactics, such as ways to overcome  challenges in matching a government payload with a commercial host. As  we found in our work on commercial strategic sourcing best practices,  organizations that struggled with fragmented information in the past  overcame this challenge in part by consolidating their data on costs and  spending. While hosted payload acquisitions are not a typical service  acquisition, successful organizations have found that these techniques  work for highly specialized technical services for which few suppliers  exist."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As DOD considers new architectures and acquisition approaches,  commercially hosted payloads have the potential to play a role in  delivering needed capabilities on orbit more quickly and at a more  affordable cost than traditional DOD space acquisitions. Placing DOD  payloads on commercial satellites might also be an effective method by  which to increase resiliency. However, DOD\u2019s experience and the data  collected so far are limited in informing decisions on the use of these  payloads. DOD would benefit from leveraging the knowledge and  information gained from each hosted payload experience. Centralized  collection and assessment of agency-wide data would help enable DOD  to mitigate the logistical challenges inherent in matching payloads to  hosts, and better position DOD to make reasoned, evidence-based  decisions on whether a hosted payload would be a viable solution to meet  warfighter needs. Without such knowledge, and a way for interested  programs to leverage it, DOD may not be fully informed about using  hosted payloads and may risk missing opportunities to rapidly and  affordably address emerging threats in space."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["The Secretary of Defense should require programs using hosted  payloads to provide cost and technical data, and lessons learned to a  central office.
