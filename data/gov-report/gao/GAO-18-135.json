Consequently, the data are updated on an ad-hoc basis and may not be timely or complete, according to officials. Federal internal control standards call for management to use quality information to achieve the entity's objectives. Until the Coast Guard issues an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that establishes policies and procedures to improve the reliability and completeness of TAP data, it will lack quality information to gauge the extent to which it is meeting TAP participation requirements in the VOW to Hire Heroes Act of 2011.", "According to GAO's survey of Coast Guard installations, various factors affected participation, such as servicemembers serving at geographically remote locations or separating from the Coast Guard rapidly. TAP officials and Coast Guard servicemembers GAO interviewed said commanders and direct supervisors sometimes pulled servicemembers out of TAP class or postponed participation because of mission priorities. TAP managers also said they rely on delivering TAP online because many Coast Guard servicemembers are stationed remotely.", "The Coast Guard cannot effectively measure performance to ensure key TAP requirements are met because it lacks reliable data and does not monitor compliance with several TAP requirements. Further, the Coast Guard has not established a formal performance goal against which it can measure progress, although federal internal control standards stipulate that management should consider external requirements\u2014such as the laws with which the entity is required to comply\u2014to clearly define objectives in specific and measurable terms. Establishing a goal could help the Coast Guard define expected performance. In addition, the Coast Guard does not monitor TAP requirements regarding the timeliness of servicemembers' TAP participation or their access to additional 2-day classes. Consequently, it cannot know whether servicemembers are starting TAP early enough to complete the program or those who elected to attend additional 2-day classes were able to do so before separation or retirement, as required by the Act. Finally, the Coast Guard lacks an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that establishes the roles and responsibilities of Coast Guard staff in implementing TAP. Federal internal control standards stipulate that management should assign responsibility and delegate authority to key roles throughout the entity.

In contrast, according to Coast Guard officials,  Coast Guard has not promulgated any regulations to implement TAP.  Further, Coast Guard issued its most recent Commandant Instruction in  2003, approximately 8 years prior to TAP redesign in 2011.

Given the lack of timely and complete data, we  determined the Coast Guard\u2019s TAP data were not sufficiently reliable for an analysis of participation in TAP classes.

However, Coast Guard  servicemembers and TAP officials we spoke with said unit commanders  or direct supervisors sometimes prevented participation. All three TAP  managers we spoke with (of 12 nationwide) told us that while  commanders generally allowed servicemembers to register for TAP  courses, they occasionally required them to return to their duties before  completing the courses. We observed this during a TAP class at a Coast  Guard installation we visited when a servicemember\u2019s commander  ordered her to return to the unit during TAP training and she missed a  briefing she wanted to attend. Two of three TAP managers we  interviewed also said commanders sometimes required servicemembers  under their command to wait to take TAP classes until close to their  separation date because of mission priorities.", "Two of three TAP managers interviewed said that commanders in the  Coast Guard face unique challenges in ensuring TAP participation. They  said commanders in all branches of the military must balance competing  demands, including their primary mission and the training needs of the  personnel they oversee. They said it can be particularly difficult for Coast  Guard commanders to juggle these priorities because Coast Guard  servicemembers are sometimes assigned to very small units or called to  return to duty for emergency situations during scheduled TAP classes.  One TAP manager said that a commander in a remote location had  collaborated with her to provide a classroom-based TAP class for  transitioning Coast Guard servicemembers within the commander\u2019s unit,  but rescue efforts occurred during the class which resulted in most of  those servicemembers returning to their vessel to respond to the  emergency. In addition, all three TAP managers we spoke with said there  are limited resources for holding TAP in a classroom setting.

For example, one  manager corroborated our survey results, saying that many Coast Guard  servicemembers worked in small units assigned to remote and  geographically dispersed locations, making it difficult to convene a  sufficient number of transitioning Coast Guard servicemembers to meet  minimum class size requirements. In addition, all three managers said  they used the online version of TAP for remotely stationed Coast Guard  servicemembers because the Coast Guard lacked the resources for them  to attend classes in person. Although they preferred that  servicemembers participate in live, classroom-based TAP classes, all of  the managers acknowledged that the online version of TAP played an  integral role in ensuring that more servicemembers could participate in  the program. However, two of them noted that while classroom delivery of  TAP classes provided an interactive learning environment that allowed  participants to ask questions and learn from their peers, online  participants generally clicked quickly through the slides and had difficulty  understanding the information being presented. Two managers told us  that they regularly used the online version to deliver parts of the TAP  curriculum. For example, one TAP manager said she required  participants to complete the crosswalk of military and civilian occupations  class online before attending required classes in person. Two managers  noted that additional 2-day classes were available online, and one noted  that some servicemembers attended these classes in a classroom setting  either on a Coast Guard base or a DOD installation.

As such, the Transition Assistance Program  (TAP) serves a critically important function\u2014to give servicemembers the  tools and information they need to successfully transition to life outside  the military. Federal law requires that the Coast Guard ensure all eligible  servicemembers participate in the program, but thousands of Coast  Guard servicemembers may have transitioned without the support  provided by TAP. Reliably tracking participation has proven to be a  challenge for the Coast Guard, in part because it lacks a current  Commandant Instruction that defines the roles and responsibilities of staff  responsible for implementing TAP and ensuring complete and reliable  data are collected. In preparing to issue an updated Commandant  Instruction, the Coast Guard has taken a positive step toward addressing  the limitations of its current TAP data, and will be better positioned to  ensure compliance with VOW Act requirements using reliable data.", "In addition to collecting reliable data, the Coast Guard could further  demonstrate its commitment to meeting TAP requirements by  establishing formal performance goals that measure the extent to which  Coast Guard servicemembers participate in TAP. By establishing interim  performance goals, the agency would be able to show its progress  towards achieving full compliance. Moreover, communicating  performance goals to unit and installation commanders could enhance  accountability and might spur progress toward meeting federal program  requirements.", "By expanding its monitoring efforts beyond tracking participation in TAP\u2019s  required classes, the Coast Guard could enhance its ability to ensure  other TAP requirements are met and that its servicemembers are able to  access additional transition resources. Monitoring the timeliness of  participation would help ensure Coast Guard servicemembers have  adequate time to complete TAP before leaving the military. Further, by  monitoring requests to participate in additional 2-day classes and 2-day  class attendance, the Coast Guard would be in a better position to identify  whether servicemembers who wish to attend the classes are able to do  so, to determine whether more classes are needed, and to communicate  this information to the interagency partners responsible for delivering  these classes.", "Commanders can also play a key role in bolstering TAP participation.  Having an up-to-date written Commandant Instruction that explicitly  describes commanders\u2019 roles and responsibilities could enhance  commanders\u2019 ability to ensure TAP\u2019s proper implementation and  compliance with VOW Act requirements. Moreover, once data quality  improves, providing commanders a mechanism to readily determine  whether servicemembers under their command have completed TAP  could help them monitor the program to ensure that all TAP-eligible  servicemembers receive the resources they need to successfully  transition to civilian life.", "Finally, once more reliable data on Coast Guard servicemember  participation are available, sharing this information with interagency  partners could improve TAP implementation on a broader scale.
