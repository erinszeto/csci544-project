These revisions decreased DOD's projected O&M and MILPERS funding needs. DOD's revision of the budget rates during these years also decreased the expected gains (that is, buying power) that would have resulted from an increase in the strength of the U.S. Dollar relative to other foreign currencies. DOD did not revise its budget rates in fiscal years 2009 through 2013. For fiscal year 2017, DOD changed its methodology for producing budget rates, resulting in rates that were more closely aligned with market rates. According to officials, that change made it unnecessary to revise the budget rates during the fiscal year.", "DOD has taken some steps to reduce costs in selecting foreign currency rates used to pay (that is, disburse amounts) for goods and services, but DOD has not fully determined whether opportunities exist to achieve additional savings. The Army has estimated potential savings of up to $10 million annually by using a foreign currency rate available 3 days in advance of paying for goods or services rather than a more costly rate available up to 5 days in advance. The Army has converted to the use of a 3-day advanced rate. GAO's analysis suggests that DOD could achieve cost savings if the services reviewed and consistently selected the most cost-effective foreign currency rates when paying for their goods and services. Absent a review, DOD is at risk for paying more than it would otherwise be required to conduct its transactions.", "DOD used the Foreign Currency Fluctuations, Defense (FCFD) account to cover losses (that is, less buying power) due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations in 6 of the 8 years GAO reviewed. Since 2012, DOD has maintained the FCFD account balance at the statutory limit of $970 million, largely by transferring unobligated balances before they are cancelled from certain DOD accounts into the FCFD. However, DOD has not identified the appropriate FCFD account balance needed to maintain program operations by routinely analyzing projected losses and basing any transfers into the account on those expected losses. Thus, DOD may be maintaining balances that are hundreds of millions of dollars higher than needed, and that could have been used for other purposes or returned to the Treasury Department (see figure)."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations, including that DOD review opportunities to achieve cost savings by more consistently selecting the most cost-effective foreign currency rates used for the payment of goods and services, and analyze projected losses to manage the FCFD account balance.

As part of the annual budget  formulation process, DOD selects exchange rates for each of the nine  foreign currencies it uses to develop its O&M and MILPERS funding  requirements. Budget formulation for a particular fiscal year starts  approximately 18 months prior to the beginning of that fiscal year. DOD refers to foreign currency exchange rates established during the budget  formulation process as the budget rates.", "During each fiscal year, DOD\u2019s O&M and MILPERS appropriations incur  new obligations for overseas expenditures at the budget rate for a  particular foreign currency. The fiscal year during which an appropriation  may incur new obligations is known as the period of availability. DOD  liquidates those obligations through disbursements at the foreign currency  market rates available at the time the disbursements are made. DOD  typically disburses funds to liquidate its MILPERS obligations during the  fiscal year of availability because MILPERS appropriations fund service- member salaries, which are paid on a regular basis throughout the fiscal  year. However, O&M appropriations are generally obligated for the  provision of goods and services, and the liquidation of those obligations  may not always occur within the fiscal year of availability. Disbursements  to liquidate O&M obligations also commonly occur during an  appropriation\u2019s 5-year period of expiration, particularly during the first year  of expiration, during which amounts are available only for limited  purposes, such as disbursement (see figure 1). Differences between the  foreign currency budget rate applied when an obligation is incurred and  the foreign currency market rate applied at the time of disbursement will  result in either a gain or a loss in the amount of appropriations available  to DOD for its planned overseas expenditures.", "In fiscal year 1979, Congress appropriated $500 million to establish the  Foreign Currency Fluctuations, Defense (FCFD) account for purposes of  maintaining the budgeted level of operations in the MILPERS and O&M  accounts by eliminating substantial gains or losses to the appropriations  caused by foreign currency rate fluctuations that vary from rates used in  preparing budget submissions.

We  discussed with DOD officials the process for reviewing the rates and the  factors considered in determining whether to revise the rates.  Additionally, to understand the effects that revising the budget rates had  on DOD\u2019s O&M and MILPERS funding estimates, and the potential for  gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations, we compared DOD\u2019s  initial foreign currency budget rates and revised foreign currency budget  rates against rates published by the U.S. Treasury Department (Treasury)  for fiscal years 2009 through 2017. This period corresponded with the  data available to us on DOD\u2019s initial and revised rates, and it allowed for  use of the most current data available, because while we were conducting  our audit work DOD had not yet decided whether or not to revise the  fiscal year 2018 budget rates. We chose rates published by Treasury for  this comparison because Treasury has the sole authority to establish for  all foreign currencies or credits the exchange rates at which such  currencies are to be reported by all agencies of the government.", "For our second objective, we reviewed accounting standards and  disbursement guidelines such as DOD\u2019s Financial Management  Regulation, which mirrors the FCFD account\u2019s statutory authority by  directing that MILPERS and O&M obligations be liquidated and amounts  be disbursed at the foreign currency market rate that is current at the  time. We discussed with DOD officials the foreign currency rates used  to liquidate DOD\u2019s obligations; any analysis and ongoing efforts to identify  options for selecting more cost-effective disbursement rates; and whether  there is guidance that may be considered in selecting a disbursement  rate. We also analyzed a non-generalizable selection of data from  Treasury for disbursements made during the months of June and July  2017 to determine what foreign currency rates were used and what  savings may have been possible using alternate rates. We chose these  two months because they were the most recent data available on  disbursements at the time Treasury provided the data for our review.", "For our third objective, we analyzed DOD data for fiscal years 2009  through 2016 on foreign currency gains and losses reported by each of  the services that resulted from differences between the foreign currency  budget rate applied when incurring obligations and the rates applied when  those obligations were liquidated; transfers of amounts between the  FCFD account and the services\u2019 O&M and MILPERS appropriations  accounts; and the end-of-year FCFD account balances. We chose this  time period in order to capture years in which both gains and losses were  experienced, and for which DOD had complete data on gains and losses,  fund transfers, and end-of-year balances for the FCFD account. We  compared the end-of-year FCFD account balances and the use of the  FCFD account against guidelines on the importance of examining  unobligated carryover balances established in our prior work.  Additionally, we reviewed and analyzed DOD financial reports on foreign  currency gains or losses and compared the reports, including any  identified discrepancies, against standards for accurate reporting and  maintaining quality information, such as those identified in GAO\u2019s  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government and the Federal  Accounting Standards Advisory Board\u2019s Handbook of Federal Accounting  Standards and Other Pronouncements.", "To determine the reliability of the data used in addressing these  objectives, we analyzed DOD and Treasury foreign currency rates, data  on DOD foreign currency disbursements, and DOD financial reporting  data on foreign currency gains and losses to identify any missing or  inaccurate information; and we discussed with agency officials any  identified data abnormalities and how the data were extracted from  systems, when appropriate. We found the data to be sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of our reporting objectives, with the exception of the  financial reporting on financial gains and losses. Specifically, based on  problems with the completeness and accuracy of DOD\u2019s financial  reporting on foreign currency gains and losses, we found that these data  were not sufficiently reliable for the purpose of computing exact totals for  the gains and losses DOD experienced. However, because DOD uses  these data as the basis for decisions related to management of the FCFD  account, we included the data in our analysis to provide insight into the  general scope of gains and losses experienced. We also spoke with  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)),  military service, and Treasury officials regarding the process and systems  used to input the data and generate the foreign currency reports we  reviewed.

Foreign currency budget rates for a particular  fiscal year are established approximately 18 months prior to the fiscal  year when overseas obligations will be incurred and disbursements  made. For example, in June 2015, OUSD(C) issued guidance to, in part,  instruct the services on the foreign currency rates to use in building their  fiscal year 2017 budgets. In February 2016, as part of the President\u2019s  budget, DOD submitted its proposed fiscal year 2017 budget to  Congress, and it began incurring obligations against subsequently  appropriated amounts on October 1, 2016.", "DOD has used various methodologies for establishing the foreign  currency budget rates. In 2005, we reviewed DOD\u2019s methodology for  developing its foreign currency budget rates and reported that DOD\u2019s  approach for estimating its foreign currency requirements for the fiscal  year 2006 budget was a reasonable approach for forecasting foreign  currency rates that could produce a more realistic estimate than its  historical approach.

Specifically, DOD established  its foreign currency rates by calculating a 6-month average of Wall Street  Journal rates published every Monday from May 25, 2015, to November  16, 2015. According to an OUSD(C) official, the 6-month average more  closely represented foreign currency exchange rates experienced by the  department during budget formulation, and it accounted for the strength of  the U.S. Dollar, which had increased as compared with its historical 5- year average. DOD\u2019s analysis found that the use of the 5-year historical  average would have resulted in substantial gains when compared with  gains expected from application of the 6-month average.

ITS.gov offers a number of rates,  including advanced rates available up to 5 days in advance of  disbursement, and the spot rate. The spot rate is the price for foreign  currencies for delivery in 2 business days. While advanced rates, like spot  rates, are based on the current market rate, advanced rates at the time  they are selected are generally higher than the spot rate, with the 5-day  advanced rate being the highest, because the rates are locked in ahead  of the actual value date.

According to the  OUSD(C) official responsible for formulating and revising the foreign  currency budget rates, the delay that occurs between the time when a  budget rate is set (approximately 18 months prior to the beginning of a  particular fiscal year) and the actual fiscal year is a major factor for why  the budget rate may be revised.

Therefore, revisions to the budget rates not only  change DOD\u2019s projected O&M and MILPERS funding requirements for  the fiscal year in which the revisions occur, but also change the baseline  from which the potential gains or losses would result when DOD  liquidates its overseas O&M and MILPERS obligations through  disbursements. For example, in fiscal year 2016, Congress reduced  DOD\u2019s total appropriations by $1.5 billion. As a result of this reduction and  favorable foreign currency rates, DOD revised its fiscal year 2016 budget  rates in February 2016 and applied the revised foreign currency budget  rates in its calculations of gains and losses due to foreign currency  fluctuations since the beginning of the fiscal year to absorb the reduced  funding level. In applying the revised budget rates, a $30 million gain  DOD had previously projected became a projected loss of about $186.2  million. The use of revised budget rates also affects the movement of  funds from the FCFD account. For example, if the use of the revised  budget rate creates a loss and DOD is unable to cover the increased  costs to its O&M or MILPERS appropriations, funds from the FCFD  account may be used to cover its planned overseas expenditures."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Taken Some Steps to Reduce Costs, but Has Not Fully Explored Additional Opportunities to Achieve Savings When Selecting Foreign Currency Rates", "paragraphs": ["DOD has taken some steps to reduce costs in selecting foreign currency  rates to liquidate its obligations through disbursements. However, DOD  organizations are not always selecting the most cost-effective rates to  convert U.S. Dollars, and DOD has not determined whether opportunities  exist to achieve additional efficiencies when making disbursements. DOD  liquidates its obligations through disbursements for overseas  expenditures using Treasury\u2019s ITS.gov system, which provides DOD  organizations with a choice of foreign currency rates to apply when  making disbursements in a foreign currency. The foreign currency rate  chosen determines how many U.S. Dollars must be paid for the  transaction. Treasury officials explained that customers may choose  either the spot rate or an advanced rate. The spot rate is the price for  foreign currencies for delivery in 2 business days. Treasury officials  explained that advanced rates are exchange rates that are \u201clocked in\u201d and  guaranteed by the bank processing the disbursement 5, 4, or 3 days in  advance of payment processing, which is known as the \u201cvalue date\u201d of a  disbursement. Normally, the cost of the rate increases the further from the  date of disbursement that it is locked in.", "While DOD often uses a 5-day advanced rate to make its disbursements,  the other rate options available, such as a 3-day advanced and a spot  rate, can be more cost-effective. We analyzed data provided by Treasury  from its ITS.gov system and found that for disbursements made during  the period of June and July 2017, the 5-day advanced rate was more  costly than the 3-day advanced rate. In instances where the spot rate was  available, we found that it was also more cost-effective than either the 3- day or 5-day advanced rates. For example, for those transactions  processed through ITS.gov on June 13, 2017, DOD would have paid 1  U.S. Dollar for .881 European Euros if using the 5-day advanced rate;  .883 European Euros if using the 3-day advanced rate; and .889  European Euros if using the spot rate.", "In the case of the Army, an Army Financial Management Command  official provided us information indicating that the service has estimated  potential cost savings that would result from more consistently selecting  3-day advanced rates through the ITS.gov system to make overseas  disbursements of amounts, rather than the 5-day advanced rate. More  specifically, the Army estimated between $8 million and $10 million in  annual savings by transitioning from a 5-day to a 3-day advanced rate  when selecting foreign currency rates. According to officials, the Army  has transitioned all paying locations to the 3-day advanced rate. The  Army estimates that these locations have produced $6.04 million in  savings through February 2018. Although the Army indicated that it also  planned to analyze whether use of the spot rate was feasible, it had not  conducted this review at the time of our review.", "Data provided to us by Treasury from its ITS.gov system indicate that in  June and July of 2017, the Air Force used the 5-day advanced rate  exclusively for its disbursements, while the Navy and Marine Corps relied  on both the 5-day and the 3-day advanced rates. Our analysis of these  data show the Air Force would have achieved total savings for those 2  months of about $258,000 if it had made its disbursements using the 3- day versus the 5-day advanced rate. The savings resulting from each  transaction varied based on the amount of the transaction. For example,  on June 13, 2017, the Air Force disbursed a payment exceeding $3.7  million and would have saved more than $9,000 for that transaction if the  3-day advanced rate had been used. For the same single transaction, if  the spot rate had been used instead of the 5-day advanced rate, the Air  Force would have saved more than $31,000. The savings associated with  the Navy\u2019s and Marine Corps\u2019 disbursements for the same 2-month  period showed the potential for less dramatic savings of less than $100  because the Navy and Marine Corps used the 3-day advanced rate as  opposed to the 5-day advanced rate for most of its disbursements. Where  information on the spot rate was available, its use, as opposed to either  the 5-day or 3-day advanced rate, would have resulted in additional  savings opportunities for those 2 months. While these examples are  illustrative of cost savings opportunities in June and July 2017, Treasury  data show that in fiscal year 2016, DOD disbursed more than $11.8 billion  through ITS.gov and, as of July 2017, had disbursed more than $9.6  billion through ITS.gov.", "Our analysis suggests that DOD could achieve further cost savings by  more consistently selecting cost-effective foreign currency rates, such as  the 3-day advanced or spot rates, with which to make disbursements. In  selecting foreign currency rates, DOD\u2019s Financial Management  Regulation states that disbursements should be computed to avoid gains  or deficiencies (losses) due to fluctuations in rates of exchange to the  greatest extent possible. If there is no rate of exchange established by  agreement between the U.S. government and the foreign country, then  foreign currency transactions are to be conducted at the prevailing rate.", "The prevailing rate of exchange is the most favorable rate legally  available for acquisition of foreign currency for official disbursement and  other exchange transactions. Additionally, GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government calls for management to periodically  review policies, procedures, and related control activities for continued  relevance and effectiveness in achieving the entity\u2019s objectives or  addressing related risks.", "DOD disbursement organizations have flexibility in selecting foreign  currency rates to use when making disbursements using ITS.gov. There  is no DOD-wide requirement for the services to review the rates used to  make disbursements and, except for the Army, the services have not  conducted such a review. This step is necessary to determine whether  there are opportunities for savings by more consistently selecting cost- effective foreign currency rates. We discussed disbursement processes  with DOD and Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps financial management  officials, including the factors considered when selecting foreign currency  rates. In addition, a Defense Finance and Accounting Service official  noted that currencies can have criteria specifying when a payment is  made and provided us the ITS.gov user\u2019s guide, which addresses \u201cspecial  currency requirements,\u201d such as those that would drive advanced  payment for a currency. For example, the user\u2019s guide indicates that  payment for transactions involving the Afghanistan Afghani must be made  2 days in advance of the value date, and cannot be made on a Friday.  However, information that is contained in the ITS.gov user\u2019s guide and  that we received from a Treasury official indicate that none of the nine  foreign currencies for which DOD budgets place restrictions on when  payment must be made; and therefore, this consideration should not drive  the use of a specific rate at disbursement.", "Marine Corps financial management officials told us that the foreign  currency rate selected at disbursement is at the discretion of the  disbursing officer based on operational requirements, with the  understanding that the most favorable rate for the government is the  preference, while balancing mission requirements and the time necessary  to process the transaction. These officials acknowledged that the 3-day advanced rate can be more cost-effective to the government but indicated  that there are occasions when the 5-day advanced rate should be used  because it provides more time to process the payments from deployed  locations operating in different time zones or with limited communication  capabilities.", "However, we found that OUSD (C) officials and financial management  officials with the headquarters of the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps  were not involved in disbursement, were unaware of what rates were  being used at disbursement, and had not reviewed the rationale for  selecting one rate over another. For example, Air Force and Navy  headquarters officials we spoke with were unable to provide insight as to  what drives the decision to use one rate over another. One Navy financial  management official told us that he was unaware of any Navy policy that  directs a specific rate to be used when disbursing funds, and suggested  that the absence of such a policy provides the flexibility for officials to  determine which approach is best. Headquarters, Marine Corps officials  also stated that they did not monitor foreign currency rates used for  disbursements or the reasons why one rate was selected over another.  Based on our inquiry, officials indicated that they would analyze the  foreign currency rates used for disbursements in 2017 and whether  opportunities existed to achieve savings by using other rates available  through ITS.gov. A Marine Corps official subsequently provided us with  information that showed that two of three disbursing offices that currently  utilize ITS.gov for disbursements use the 3-day advanced rate exclusively  and one uses the 5-day advanced rate. The official noted that a technical  issue within ITS.gov has restricted the disbursing office currently using  the 5-day advanced rate from choosing any other rate, but that the  service was further assessing options to correct the issue.", "In our conversations with an official in OUSD(C) about why the other  services had not reviewed the foreign currency rates used for  disbursements to determine what was being paid through ITS.gov and  whether there was an opportunity for savings, the official commented that  OUSD(C) had not directed the services to conduct any reviews in this  area. This official was unaware that different foreign currency rates were  used to make disbursements, and assumed that the military services all  make disbursements in the same way. However, as discussed above, the  services are using different rates resulting in inconsistency across the  department. The official further indicated that DOD could perform a  review to determine the cost differences of using one disbursement rate  over another. Absent a review of the rates the services are using in  making disbursements and whether cost savings could be achieved by  more consistently selecting the most cost-effective foreign currency rates  available for use at disbursement, DOD is at risk for paying more to  convert U.S. Dollars for overseas expenditures than would otherwise be  required."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Used the FCFD Account to Cover Losses Due to Foreign Currency Fluctuations, but Does Not Manage the Account Balance Based on Projected Losses or Quality Data", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal years 2009 through 2016, DOD used the FCFD account to cover  losses that the services experienced due to foreign currency fluctuations  in 6 of the 8 years we reviewed.

The  transfer amounts were based on both losses realized from actual  disbursements and projected losses for any remaining obligations to be  liquidated. The projected losses were calculated based on the current  foreign currency market rates as of the time of the calculation. Based on  the service-level data we reviewed, all of the services reported that they  experienced losses in at least 5 of the fiscal years we reviewed. For  example, the Army reported that it experienced losses in its MILPERS  account for 5 of 8 years, while the Marine Corps reported that it  experienced losses in its O&M and MILPERS accounts in each of the 8  years. In addition to the transfers to cover losses within the services\u2019  MILPERS and O&M accounts, in fiscal year 2013 DOD transferred an  additional $969 million to the Defense Working Capital Fund to offset fuel  cost losses.", "Since fiscal year 2012, DOD has maintained the FCFD end-of-year  account balance at $970 million\u2014the maximum allowed by statute.

While DOD can also replenish the FCFD  account or absorb foreign currency losses in certain currencies by  transferring to the FCFD account any gains experienced by the services,  our analysis found that DOD did not transfer any gains into the FCFD  account for fiscal years 2009 through 2016.

Of the $1.92 billion transferred from the  FCFD account to the services\u2019 MILPERS and O&M accounts to cover  losses, $464.5 million was transferred since fiscal year 2012, when DOD  began maintaining its FCFD account at the maximum level. During that  time, some of the services experienced foreign currency gains, while  others experienced losses. For example, at the end of fiscal year 2013  the Navy reported a total realized and projected cumulative gain for its  O&M and MILPERS accounts of about $98.6 million. In that same year,  the Marine Corps reported a cumulative realized and projected loss for its  O&M and MILPERS accounts of approximately $12.7 million. Had DOD  not transferred unobligated funds back into the FCFD account, it would  have retained a positive balance of approximately $505.5 million.

In addition, this official stated that DOD prefers to  maintain the maximum balance in case it is needed due to sudden,  unfavorable swings in foreign currency exchange rates.", "Our review of the documentation used to make transfers into and out of  the FCFD account corroborates that DOD maintains the FCFD account  balance to maximize the retention of unobligated balances. Specifically,  we found instances in which the documentation states that the transfers  of unobligated balances into the FCFD account were made for the  purpose of replenishing the account balance to the statutory limit. For  example, DOD transferred $89 million from the FCFD account to the  Army for losses it had realized and projected in fiscal year 2014, and later  transferred unobligated balances of the same amount back into the  account. DOD\u2019s documentation states that this transfer of unobligated  balances was made for the purpose of replenishing the account to $970  million in order to finance estimated foreign currency losses resulting from  the decline in value of the U.S. Dollar. However, the transfer to the Army  already covered the realized losses and projected losses for any  remaining disbursements. In other words, estimated foreign currency  losses had already been accounted for at the time of the transfer to the  Army.", "In addition, based on data reported by the Air Force, Marine Corps, and  Navy, DOD had an estimated cumulative gain of about $30 million for  fiscal year 2014 based on the other services\u2019 gains and losses, which  could have been transferred to the FCFD account to absorb any  additional foreign currency losses elsewhere. However, DOD did not  transfer those gains to the FCFD account. Similarly, based on data  reported by these services, DOD experienced cumulative realized and  projected gains of more than $200 million in fiscal year 2013 and about  $92.6 million in fiscal year 2015, but it did not transfer any gains to the  FCFD account because the account balance had already reached its  maximum using transferred unobligated balances.", "Despite replenishing the account balance to the maximum amount for the  purpose of covering additional losses, the FCFD transfers have not been  made to fully offset losses in some years, further raising questions about  the need to maintain the balance at the statutory cap of $970 million  annually. Specifically, in 3 of the 6 years in which DOD transferred funds  from the FCFD account to the services\u2019 MILPERS and O&M accounts,  DOD did not use the FCFD account to fully cover the losses that the Air  Force, Marine Corps, and Navy experienced. In fiscal year 2011, for  example, DOD\u2019s transfers out of the FCFD account to these services  covered about 88 percent of the reported MILPERS and O&M losses that  these services had realized and projected to lose by the end of the fiscal  year. In fiscal year 2012, FCFD transfers covered almost 72 percent of  the MILPERS and O&M realized and projected losses reported by the Air  Force, Marine Corps, and Navy, as of the end of the fiscal year. In fiscal  year 2016, DOD FCFD transfers to these services covered approximately  55 percent of their reported MILPERS and O&M realized and projected  losses by the end of the fiscal year.", "The OUSD(C) official we spoke with stated that FCFD transfers to cover  losses begin with a request from the services, and the OUSD(C) office  and the services then coordinate on the final transfer amount. In addition,  some service officials told us that they try to cover their losses using each  service\u2019s available funding before reaching out for assistance from the  FCFD account. Therefore, based on a service\u2019s ability to cover the loss, it  may not always request an FCFD transfer to cover the full amount of  realized and projected losses. Further, according to an OUSD(C) official,  the timing of a service\u2019s request for an FCFD transfer may also affect any  differences between the amount transferred and the actual losses  experienced. Specifically, if a service requests a transfer early in the fiscal  year based on realized and projected losses, actual losses experienced  as of the end of the fiscal year may be greater than or less than the  transfer amount due to foreign currency fluctuations.", "Using transfers of unobligated balances, DOD has maintained its FCFD  account balance at the maximum level allowed by statute because it has  not analyzed realized and projected losses to determine what size  account balance is necessary to meet the intended purpose of the  account. In our prior work, we have developed key questions for  evaluating federal account balances that agencies may use to identify the  amount of the balance necessary to maintain agency or program  operations. Through examination of carryover balances, oversight of  agencies\u2019 management of federal funds may be enhanced. Specifically,  we reported that understanding an agency\u2019s processes for estimating and  managing carryover balances provides information to assess how  effectively agencies anticipate program needs, and ensure the most  efficient use of resources. To estimate and manage carryover balances,  agencies may consider such factors as future needs of the account,  economic indicators, and historical data. If an agency does not have a  robust strategy in place to manage carryover balances or is unable to  adequately explain or support the reported carryover balance, then a  more in-depth review is warranted. In those cases, balances may either  fall too low to efficiently manage operations or rise to unnecessarily high  levels, producing potential opportunities for those funds to be used more  efficiently elsewhere.", "When asked about maintaining the balance at a level necessary to cover  losses, rather than at the maximum level allowed by statute, the  OUSD(C) official indicated that the OUSD(C) takes a cautious approach  and prefers to have the additional flexibility allowed by the higher balance.  Further, the official stated that it would be difficult for DOD to attempt to  base its unobligated balance transfers and the FCFD account balance on  analysis and evaluation, given the unpredictable nature and constant  volatility of foreign currency rates. Our guidelines on evaluating carryover  balances acknowledge that external events beyond an agency\u2019s control  can dramatically affect carryover balances. However, the challenges that  are inherent in predicting foreign currency rates do not preclude DOD  from conducting analysis to glean insight as to the appropriate size for the  balance of the account and what potential opportunities for savings might  exist. Specifically, our guidelines suggest that agencies would benefit  from considering the sources and fiscal characteristics of an account with  carryover balances. In this case, the FCFD account can receive funds  from transfers of unobligated balances and realized foreign currency  gains. In addition, DOD can make multiple transfers throughout a fiscal  year and can transfer funds from the FCFD to and from the services\u2019  O&M and MILPERS accounts simultaneously, if necessary.", "These characteristics of the FCFD account already provide the  department with flexibility, indicating that DOD may be positioned to  manage the FCFD balance in a more analytical manner based on any  projected losses. Without analyzing any realized or projected losses to  determine what balance may be needed to meet the FCFD account\u2019s  intended purpose, the account balance may be kept at a higher level than  is necessary. As a result, although an exact amount is unknown, DOD  may be maintaining balances in the FCFD account that are hundreds of  millions of dollars higher than needed to cover any losses it has  experienced, and these funds may have been more efficiently used in  supporting other defense activities or returned to Treasury after the  account is canceled by law."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Lacks Quality Data to Support Management of the FCFD Account", "paragraphs": ["DOD prepares financial reports to monitor the status of its foreign  currency funds, but some of DOD\u2019s financial reporting on foreign currency  fluctuations for fiscal years 2009 through 2016 is incomplete and  inaccurate.

For instance, we found the following:  Incomplete data in the Foreign Currency Fluctuations Defense  (O&M) reports: In our review of the end-of-year Foreign Currency  Fluctuations Defense (O&M) and (MILPERS) reports we observed  several instances of incomplete data in the O&M reports, and these  affect managers\u2019 ability to make sound decisions to manage foreign  currency gains and losses. First, for the Navy, we found that the  report data showed, for multiple currencies across fiscal years 2011  through 2016, values in the realized variance column, indicating that  the service had experienced a gain or loss in a particular currency;  however, the reports showed values of zero in other columns that are  necessary for calculating the gain or loss. Second, the Air Force data  for the Turkey Lira, in fiscal year 2012, showed a gain or loss without  any data indicating what would have driven the gain or loss. Third, in  one instance, Marine Corps data on obligations for fiscal year 2011  were missing from the end-of-year reports until 2014.

The reports are inaccurate in that the Army\u2019s accounting system  charges disbursements to the current fiscal year appropriation rather  than to the fiscal year appropriation that incurred the obligation, as  required by the Financial Management Regulation. According to  officials from the Army Budget Office, the Army designed its General  Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS) to record disbursements  to the current fiscal year based on differing interpretations of a  previous version of the Regulation.

(Recommendation 4)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comment. In its  written comments, reproduced in appendix II, DOD concurred with our  first, third, and fourth recommendations and outlined its plan to address  them. DOD partially concurred with our second recommendation that the  Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) analyze realized and projected  losses to determine the necessary size of the FCFD account balance and  use the results of the analysis as the basis for transfers of unobligated  balances to the account. DOD also provided technical comments, which  we incorporated in the report, where appropriate.", "In partially concurring with our second recommendation, DOD stated that  projecting foreign currency gains or losses can be difficult given that  foreign currency rates can be volatile due to various factors, such as  trade balances, money supply, and national income, as well as arbitrary  disturbances that affect foreign currency rates that cannot be predicted or  forecasted, such as the departure of the United Kingdom from the  European Union. DOD noted that because of the risk and volatility  associated with foreign currency rates, the Congress established the  FCFD account.", "We agree that forecasting foreign currency rates is challenging due to  market volatility and include examples in our report of the effect of foreign  currency rate fluctuations on DOD\u2019s planned foreign currency obligations.  Our report also describes the relationship between gains and losses and  foreign currency fluctuations, and the movement of funds from the FCFD  account to offset any losses. As our report also discusses, DOD  calculates actual and projected losses due to foreign currency fluctuations  and uses those projections as the basis, at least in part, for any transfers  out of the FCFD account to cover losses experienced in the military  services\u2019 O&M and MILPERS appropriations. However, our report also  notes that DOD does not consider its calculations of actual and future  projected losses when making transfers of unobligated O&M and  MILPERS balances to replenish the FCFD account. Instead, since fiscal  year 2012, DOD has kept the FCFD account balance at the maximum  level allowed by statute by using unobligated balances before they are  canceled and are no longer available to DOD, regardless of whether the  funds were needed in the account to offset any projected losses.", "DOD\u2019s comments also stated that projecting gains or losses for foreign  currency to determine the size of the FCFD account opens the door to  greater uncertainty and risk at a time when the department is working to  rebuild readiness and implement the National Defense Strategy. Our  report describes the characteristics of the FCFD account that provide  DOD with flexibility to manage market volatility, thereby helping to  address uncertainty and reduce risk. For example, DOD can make  multiple transfers of funds to the FCFD account throughout a fiscal year in  response to unforeseen foreign currency fluctuations. The FCFD account  can also receive funds from transfers of actual foreign currency gains  and/or unobligated balances. As we also noted, DOD made use of its  authority to transfer expired unobligated MILPERS and O&M amounts  into the FCFD account in the event that actual losses exceeded the  projected amounts and additional transfers were deemed necessary.", "We continue to believe that by analyzing actual and projected losses and  basing the transfer of any unobligated balances on these losses, DOD  would be better positioned to determine the size of the FCFD account  balance that is necessary to meet its intended purpose. Further, such  analyses would provide opportunities to more efficiently use unobligated  balances for other defense activities or return the balances to Treasury.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense, the  Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), the Secretary of the Army, the  Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary of the Air Force, the Commandant of  the Marine Corps, and appropriate congressional committees.

We compared DOD\u2019s initial foreign currency budget rates and  revised foreign currency budget rates with rates published by the U.S.  Treasury Department (Treasury) for fiscal years 2009 through 2017. This  period corresponded with data available to us on DOD\u2019s initial and  revised rates and allowed for use of the most current data available, since  DOD had not yet decided whether or not to revise the fiscal year 2018  budget rates, while we were conducting our audit work. We chose rates  published by Treasury for this comparison because Treasury has the sole  authority to establish for all foreign currencies or credits the exchange  rates at which such currencies are to be reported by all agencies of the  government.", "Because Treasury rates are issued quarterly, we averaged Treasury\u2019s  first and second quarter rates for each currency and compared the  Treasury average with DOD\u2019s initial budget rates. Similarly, we computed  an average of the third and fourth quarter Treasury rates for each  currency and compared them with the DOD initial or revised budget rates,  where applicable. These comparisons are meant to show the difference  between DOD\u2019s budget rates and Treasury rates for the first 6 months of  the fiscal year, and the difference between DOD\u2019s revised exchange rates  and Treasury rates for the last 6 months of the fiscal year. Further, we  analyzed the extent to which DOD\u2019s budget rates were within 10 percent  of Treasury rates during these same years. We chose 10 percent as the  basis for our analysis because Treasury\u2019s guidance states that  amendments to the quarterly rates will be published during the quarter to  reflect significant changes in the quarterly data, such as rate changes of  10 percent or more.", "Additionally, to understand the effect that revising the budget rates had on  DOD\u2019s O&M and MILPERS funding estimates and on potential gains or  losses due to foreign currency fluctuations, we used a three-step  approach. First, we identified the amount of O&M and MILPERS funds DOD requested for each currency. We converted the U.S. Dollars  requested to the total amount of foreign currency needed by multiplying  the U.S. Dollars requested by DOD\u2019s initial budget rate. Second, we  determined the total amount of U.S. Dollars required using the revised  rates by dividing the total amount of foreign currency needed using  DOD\u2019s initial budget rate by DOD\u2019s revised budget rate. We used this  same approach to determine the total amount of U.S. Dollars required  using the average Treasury rates. Third, we computed the differences in  DOD\u2019s O&M and MILPERS foreign currency funding needs by subtracting  the U.S. Dollars required to meet its foreign currency needs based on the  average Treasury rates from the amounts required based on DOD\u2019s initial  budget rates and DOD\u2019s revised budget rates, respectively. We discussed  further with officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense,  Comptroller (OUSD(C)) the factors considered in revising the rates and  whether those factors are communicated within and outside of the  department.", "To evaluate the extent to which DOD has taken steps to reduce costs in  selecting foreign currency rates at which to make disbursements and  determine whether opportunities exist to gain additional savings, we  reviewed accounting standards and any guidelines that exist regarding  disbursements and calculations of foreign currency gains and losses,  such as DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation 7000.14-R, which calls  for the use of prevailing foreign currency rates to make disbursements.  We also discussed with agency officials how those guidelines are being  carried out, and whether DOD or the services have developed guidance  that instructs the services in selecting rates used for disbursements in  foreign currencies. Additionally, we examined a non-generalizable  selection of data for DOD disbursements made during the months June  and July 2017 from Treasury\u2019s International Treasury Service (ITS.gov)  system to determine which rates DOD used during this period and what  savings might be achievable from using alternate rates. We chose data  from those 2 months because it was the most recent data available on  disbursements at the time Treasury provided the data for our review.  Additionally, we discussed with officials from OUSD(C) and the services  any analysis and ongoing efforts to transition to more cost-effective rates,  including savings that may result.", "To assess the extent to which DOD has effectively managed the Foreign  Currency Fluctuations, Defense (FCFD) account to cover losses, and  maintained quality information to manage these funds, we analyzed DOD  data for fiscal years 2009 through 2016 on foreign currency gains and  losses reported by each of the services as reported in their Foreign  Currency Fluctuation, Defense (O&M) and (MILPERS) reports;  movements of funds between the FCFD account and the services\u2019 O&M  and MILPERS accounts; and the end-of-year FCFD account balances.  We chose this time period in order to capture years in which both gains  and losses were experienced, and for which DOD had complete data on  gains and losses, fund transfers, and end-of-year balances for the FCFD  account. Because the Army charges disbursements to the current fiscal  year appropriation instead of the fiscal year appropriation that incurred  the obligation, we requested that the Army adjust its reported data on  foreign currency gains and losses and provide information consistent with  how the other services report them, and with DOD\u2019s Financial  Management Regulation. However, the Army was unable to provide us  with data that were consistent with what was provided by the other  services at the time of our review. We, therefore, were unable to use  Army data for purposes of comparison with data provided by the other  services. We compared the end-of-year FCFD account balances and the  use of the account with guidelines established in our prior work on the  importance of examining unobligated balances. Additionally, we  reviewed and analyzed DOD financial reports on foreign currency gains  or losses and compared the reports, including any identified  discrepancies, against best practices and standards on accurate reporting  and maintaining quality information, such as those in GAO\u2019s Standards  for Internal Control in the Federal Government, and the Federal  Accounting Standards Advisory Board\u2019s Handbook of Federal Accounting  Standards and Other Pronouncements, as Amended.", "To determine the reliability of the data used in addressing these  objectives, we analyzed DOD and Treasury foreign currency rates, data  on DOD foreign currency disbursements, and DOD financial reporting  data on foreign currency gains and losses to identify any missing or  inaccurate information, and we discussed with agency officials any  identified abnormalities and how the information was extracted from  systems, when appropriate. We found the data to be sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of our reporting objectives, with the exception of the  financial reporting on financial gains and losses. Specifically, based on  problems with the completeness and accuracy of DOD\u2019s financial  reporting on foreign currency gains and losses, we found that these data  were not sufficiently reliable for the purpose of computing exact totals for  the gains and losses DOD experienced. However, because DOD uses  these data as the basis for decisions related to management of the FCFD  account, we included the data in our analysis to provide insight into the  scope of gains and losses experienced. We also spoke with OUSD(C),  military service, and Treasury officials regarding the process and systems  used to input the reviewed data and generate the foreign currency reports  we reviewed.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2017 to April 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
