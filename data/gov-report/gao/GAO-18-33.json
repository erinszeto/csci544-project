GAO identified six principles from CDC's framework for preventing sexual violence, which CDC defines as including sexual harassment. GAO found that Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and military service policies generally include CDC's principles regarding prevention strategies, but none address risk and protective factors, which identify conditions or behaviors that might heighten or lower the risk of sexual harassment victimization or perpetration, respectively. Additionally, a statutory provision in fiscal year 2013 mandated that DOD, among other things, develop a comprehensive sexual harassment policy that includes prevention training, mechanisms for anonymous reporting, and mechanisms for resolving incidents of sexual harassment. OSD and service policies are generally consistent with those required elements except for the inclusion of anonymous reporting. DOD is developing a new department-wide policy that will address sexual harassment, but it is too early to determine how the policy will address these issues. Without policies that include CDC's principles and mechanisms for anonymous reporting, DOD may miss opportunities to address and potentially reduce incidents of unwanted sexual behaviors. Finally, a statutory change in fiscal year 2017 redefined sexual harassment for certain purposes so it is no longer defined solely as a form of sex discrimination but is recognized also as an adverse behavior on the spectrum of behavior that can contribute to an increase in the incidence of sexual assault. While officials indicated a need to update policies, they were unclear on the full implications, if any, of this change.", "DOD has processes for maintaining and reporting consistent data on incidents of unwanted sexual behaviors including sexual assault and incidents of domestic violence that involve sexual assault, but does not have similar processes for maintaining and reporting data on incidents of sexual harassment. Specifically, DOD uses centralized databases to maintain and report data on incidents of sexual assault and domestic violence that involve sexual assault, but relies on military service-specific databases for information on incidents of sexual harassment. DOD has not established standard data elements and definitions to guide the services in maintaining and reporting data on sexual harassment. Inconsistencies in data elements and definitions generally mean that one service may be maintaining data that is more or less detailed than, or that differs from, the data maintained by other services. Such inconsistencies may create difficulties in reporting department-wide sexual harassment data, since the individual service data must be adapted to fit reporting requirements.", "DOD has several overarching efforts to address unwanted sexual behaviors across the continuum of harm, including developing an overarching prevention strategy. However, it is unclear whether the strategy under development will contain key elements for long-term and results-oriented strategic planning such as long-term goals, strategies to achieve goals, and metrics to gauge progress. Without incorporating these elements into its overarching prevention strategy, DOD may not be in a position to effectively coordinate and integrate prevention activities and reduce instances of unwanted sexual behaviors."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD fully include in its new policy on sexual harassment CDC's principles for sexual violence prevention and mechanisms for anonymous reporting, develop standard data elements and definitions for reporting sexual harassment incidents, and incorporate in its overarching prevention strategy elements key for a long-term, results-oriented strategy.

Among other  provisions, Congress in 2008 mandated that DOD implement a  centralized, case-level database for the collection and maintenance of  information regarding sexual assaults. In 2011, Congress mandated that  DOD publish annual reports on all sexual assaults involving  servicemembers. In 2013, Congress mandated that DOD develop a  comprehensive sexual harassment policy and a plan for data collection.  Most recently, in 2016, Congress changed the definition of sexual  harassment for purposes of investigations by commanding officers into  complaints of harassment, and also mandated that DOD report on the  annual number of incidents of domestic violence, including those  involving sexual assault, whether substantiated or unsubstantiated. In  2016, Congress also took actions regarding hazing in the military\u2014 another problem behavior that may or may not have a sexual  component\u2014by mandating that DOD establish a data collection system  for hazing, improve hazing training, and issue annual reports on hazing.", "We have reported previously on DOD\u2019s efforts to prevent and respond to  unwanted sexual behaviors in the military, as well as on other problem  behaviors such as hazing.

DOD and the Department of  Homeland Security, which oversees the Coast Guard, concurred with all  of our recommendations and have begun taking actions to address  them. In 2015, we reported on our evaluation of DOD\u2019s sexual assault  prevention strategy\u2014based Centers for Disease Control\u2019s (CDC) sexual  violence framework\u2014and made five recommendations to improve upon  and implement that strategy. DOD concurred with those five  recommendations and is currently in the process of implementing them.  This is one of several reviews we have conducted on sexual assaults in  the military. We last reviewed DOD\u2019s sexual harassment program in 2011  and made five recommendations, including that DOD establish an  oversight framework to help guide the department\u2019s efforts to prevent and  address sexual harassment incidents and that DOD specify uniform data  elements that the military services should use when collecting and  reporting information on formal sexual harassment complaints. DOD  concurred with our recommendations but did not implement them. In  2010, we reported on domestic abuse at DOD and recommended that  DOD establish an oversight framework to guide its efforts in preventing  and treating domestic abuse.

We  reviewed CDC\u2019s framework for preventing sexual violence as well as our  report on DOD\u2019s sexual assault prevention strategy to identify six  principles that an organization can include in a sexual violence prevention  strategy or policy. DOD previously used this framework to guide its  strategy for preventing sexual assault. The socioecological model that  underpins and informs CDC\u2019s prevention framework is based on the  concept of addressing the health of a given population by identifying  common risk and protective factors and applying effective, tested  strategies. In addition, we reviewed DOD\u2019s sexual harassment policies  to determine the extent to which they included three elements identified in  section 579 of the NDAA for FY 2013, which directed, among other  things, that DOD develop a comprehensive policy on sexual  harassment. The three elements are (1) prevention training for  members of the armed forces; (2) mechanisms for reporting sexual  harassment, including mechanisms for anonymous reporting; and (3)  mechanisms for resolving sexual harassment that include the prosecution  of perpetrators. Two of our analysts independently reviewed the policies  and determined the degree to which each element was included.", "For our second objective, we reviewed DOD reports to Congress that  provide incident data regarding unwanted sexual behaviors, including  DOD\u2019s most recent annual report on sexual assault in the military.

We also identified collaborative efforts by OSD  offices that guide and oversee programs for addressing unwanted sexual  behaviors. We obtained information on the purpose and scope of each  effort, as well as on the participating offices. We interviewed DOD officials  in positions designed to integrate activities across the continuum of harm  to determine current activities and initiatives that the department is  undertaking to address coordination.

Further, it  is unclear how OSD plans to improve oversight and whether it intends to  include performance goals, objectives, milestones, and metrics as we  previously recommended in 2011.", "Although OSD in 2014 directed the military services to improve their  oversight of sexual harassment, none of the military services were able to  demonstrate that they had implemented all the required elements.", "Specifically, DOD\u2019s 2014 policy memorandum addressing the provisions  of section 579 also directs the military services to develop a sexual  harassment oversight framework to be reviewed quarterly by a senior  leadership forum that includes long-term goals, objectives, and  milestones; criteria for measuring progress; results-oriented performance  measures to assess effectiveness of service sexual harassment policies  and programs; standards for holding leaders accountable for promoting,  supporting, and enforcing policies, plans and programs; and strategies to  implement the oversight framework.", "While some of the military services have included elements of the  oversight framework directive from the 2014 policy memorandum, none of  them were able to provide information that demonstrated that they had  fulfilled all requirements set forth by that policy memorandum. For  instance, when asked, none of the military services were able to provide  details that they have senior leader forums that review their oversight  efforts on a quarterly basis. Officials from the Air Force told us that they  were waiting for ODMEO to release a new sexual harassment policy  before establishing the oversight framework. Officials from the Navy  referred us to their July 2017 sexual harassment policy, which instructs  the Navy Sexual Harassment Prevention and Equal Opportunity Office to  develop and implement standards for holding leaders accountable for  promoting, supporting, and enforcing sexual harassment prevention and  response policies, plans, and programs, and to develop results-oriented  performance measures to assess the effectiveness of sexual harassment  prevention and response policies and programs. Officials from the Army  referred us to their SHARP Campaign Plan, which outlines methods to  hold leaders accountable for taking appropriate action to address sexual  harassment; goals and objectives for the program; and ways to measure  program effectiveness. The Marine Corps did not respond to our request  for information regarding an oversight framework for sexual harassment.", "A new department-wide policy on sexual harassment could be helpful to  the military services as they review and update their respective policies.  As noted earlier, military service policies have some differences in how  they address aspects of sexual harassment. The Marine Corps told us  that they have been waiting for additional guidance from OSD before  updating their sexual harassment policies. However, following publicized  incidents of Marines posting inappropriate photos on line of female  servicemembers without their consent, the Marine Corps updated its  guidance in May 2017 adding \u201cthe distribution or broadcasting of an  intimate image, without consent\u201d to its list of sexual harassment incidents  that mandate separation processing. Additionally, in May 2017, a  Marine Corps official said the service was revising its sexual harassment  policy. The Navy updated its sexual harassment policy in July 2017  without additional guidance from OSD.", "We also noted during our review that most existing policies have not yet  been updated to reflect a provision in the fiscal year 2017 NDAA that  redefined sexual harassment for certain purposes so it is no longer  defined solely as a form of sex discrimination but is recognized also as an  adverse behavior on the spectrum of behavior that can contribute to an  increase in the incidence of sexual assault. We asked DOD officials from  several offices about the implications of this change. They identified some  actions they will take, but the full implications, if any, of the change are  unclear. Officials from the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness  said that there are no significant implications of the sexual harassment  definition change beyond making conforming revisions to policy  documents and guidance. ODMEO officials said that adjusting to the new  definition of sexual harassment would not significantly affect their work at  the OSD level, since they are already updating their sexual harassment  policy to reflect this change and since sexual harassment is expected to  remain within the responsibilities of ODMEO. They added that the military  services will likely have to adjust to the new definition of sexual  harassment, but did not offer details in how they would have to adjust.", "The Navy\u2019s new policy dated July 2017 reflects the new definition, but the  other military services have yet to incorporate the change. Officials from  SAPRO said that they are working with ODMEO to revise surveys on  unwanted sexual behaviors to reflect the new definition. SAPRO officials  further stated that sexual harassment should remain under ODMEO\u2019s  purview since ODMEO personnel are trained specifically in sexual  harassment response. Officials from the Army\u2019s SHARP program said  that the new definition means that sexual harassment will more often be  considered misconduct, and taken more seriously.", "Since OSD is in the process of updating its policy, we are not making any  recommendations. However, it will be important for OSD and the military  services to address our prior recommendation regarding improving the  oversight framework as well as incorporating the new definition of sexual  harassment required by the fiscal year 2017 NDAA while updating their  policies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Processes for Maintaining and Reporting Consistent Data on Incidents of Sexual Assault and Domestic Abuse That Involves Sexual Assault, but Does Not Have Reasonable Assurance of Consistent Data on Sexual Harassment", "paragraphs": ["DOD has processes for maintaining and reporting consistent data on  sexual assault incidents and domestic violence incidents that involve  sexual assault, but the department does not have similar assurance of  consistent data on incidents of sexual harassment.

FAP officials explained that they do not use  the \u201csubstantiated\u201d and \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d terminology like SAPRO  does. Rather, FAP, which is not responsible for determining criminal  or legal disposition, uses the terms \u201cmet criteria\u201d and \u201cnot met criteria\u201d  for maltreatment.

For example,  the Marine Corps records whether or not the incident involves alcohol or  drug use, which the rest of the military services do not record, and the  military services record dates differently between their respective  databases. For example, the Air Force records an initial date, the date the  complaint form was signed, the date the general court martial was sent,  the date the legal review was completed, and the final review date. The  Marine Corps records the date the incident was reported, the date the  incident occurred and whether the incident occurred over multiple dates;  the dates associated with notifications and status updates to general  courts martial proceedings; the dates associated with steps in the  investigation, including any extensions; the dates associated with  dispositions; and the dates associated with appeals. Additionally, the  military services have different ways of categorizing sexual harassment  incidents, as shown in table 3.", "As shown in table 3, while some data descriptions are similar\u2014for  instance, each of the military services include crude/offensive behavior,  unwanted sexual attention, and sexual coercion\u2014there are differences as  well. The Air Force also categorizes sexual harassment into verbal,  nonverbal, physical, and other, for example, whereas the other military  services\u2019 top-level categories are different. The Navy has a \u201cnot  applicable\u201d category that it describes as sexual harassment complaints  that do not fall under sexual harassment, and only the Air Force has an  \u201cother\u201d category. Because the military services have different descriptors  for similar data fields, DOD cannot ensure that the services are  categorizing similar types of sexual harassment in the same way.", "In addition, we found that the Army is more detailed in characterizing  different types of sexual harassment. Specifically, as shown in table 4, the  Army has an additional data field that provides more detailed descriptions  of three types of sexual harassment; the other military services\u2019  respective databases do not have this level of detail.", "Because the Army has this additional data field, it can capture information  on multiple types of harassment that may occur in a single incident. The  other military services, in contrast, do not have this capability in their  respective databases. To illustrate, if one case of sexual harassment  involved both verbal and nonverbal forms of sexual harassment, the Army  could choose a more specific characterization to describe the incident,  while the other military services would characterize the incident in more  general terms.", "ODMEO officials are considering adapting an existing system to track  instances of sexual harassment department-wide. That system, called  Force Risk Reduction (FR2), is currently used to track safety issues like  military injuries, civilian workers\u2019 compensation claims, and casualty  notifications at DOD. ODMEO recently completed a pilot of the system  with the Marine Corps, the Navy, and the Army to test whether it would be  useable for adaptation for sexual harassment data, and is planning a  second pilot to include the Air Force and the National Guard Bureau.", "According to ODMEO officials, their adaptation of FR2 is intended to  collect aggregate-level sexual harassment data from the military services,  and the military services will continue to operate and rely on their  individual databases to maintain more detailed case-level information on  incidents. For example, ODMEO\u2019s adaptation of FR2 would not have  details such as descriptions of specific incidents, or information on dates  associated with investigations or appeals. These types of data will  continue to be maintained in the service systems. ODMEO officials told  us that their new data system, if implemented, is not designed to collect  case-level details in order to avoid personally identifiable information.", "Federal internal control standards state that management should define  the identified information requirements at the relevant level and requisite  specificity for appropriate personnel.

Additionally,  inconsistent data elements and definitions may create difficulties in  reporting sexual harassment data from the military services to OSD for a  department-wide report, since ODMEO has to adapt data from the  services to fit reporting requirements.

Fully  including these elements in the department\u2019s policies can help ensure  that the military services are interpreting and applying prevention and  response efforts consistently and may also decrease the risk of  perpetration or victimization related to instances on unwanted sexual  behaviors. Further, DOD has developed reliable data systems for  collecting and reporting data on some of the unwanted sexual behaviors  including sexual assault and instances of domestic violence with sexual  assault. However, inconsistencies in sexual harassment data elements  and definitions may be creating difficulties in developing department-wide  reports on unwanted sexual behaviors. Improving and standardizing data  collection efforts will not only improve the quality of data that DOD and  the military services collect but may also increase the ability for DOD to  further develop its understanding of the connection between unwanted  sexual behaviors. Finally, DOD officials have stated that they are in the  early stages of developing an overarching strategy to address the  interconnected nature of the range of unwanted sexual behaviors. To  ensure that the department is appropriately concentrating its efforts to  prevent and respond to the full range of unwanted behaviors, it is  important that DOD include elements of a long-term, results-oriented  strategy into its overarching prevention strategy.

We identified the databases that  generate the reported data and evaluated the processes for assuring the  quality and consistency of data in those databases\u2014including the  Defense Sexual Assault Incident Database, which maintains sexual  assault data; the Central Registry database, which maintains data on  domestic violence involving sexual assault; and various military service- level databases that maintain sexual harassment data. To evaluate  DOD\u2019s reported data we reviewed pertinent statutory provisions, DOD  guidance, and the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government that address agencies\u2019 use of quality data and our prior  reports evaluating sexual assault data. In evaluating the reported data,  we obtained and reviewed statutory provisions with reporting  requirements, as well as DOD guidance on data collection for sexual  harassment, sexual assault, and domestic violence involving sexual  abuse. With regard to DOD efforts to collect and maintain sexual assault  data, we met with OSD, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps officials in  their respective Sexual Assault Prevention and Response offices as well  as officials in the Army\u2019s Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and  Prevention office. We also reviewed our prior report on DOD\u2019s Defense  Sexual Assault Incident Database and our prior report that evaluated  sexual assault data across agencies. To determine whether DOD has  processes for collecting and maintaining consistent data for domestic  violence with sexual assault, we obtained and compared data elements  and processes from DOD\u2019s Central Registry database, which contains  data for domestic violence throughout the department. We also obtained  and reviewed policies that outline processes for collecting and reporting  domestic violence involving sexual abuse data, and interviewed officials  from Family Advocacy Program offices in OSD and the Army, Navy,  Marine Corps, and Air Force to determine data reliability and  comprehensiveness. To determine the extent to which reports of sexual  assault, including reports of sexual assault among servicemembers and  reports of domestic abuse involving sexual assault, meet statutory  requirements for reporting, we reviewed DOD reports to Congress that  provide sexual assault incident data, including DOD\u2019s most recent annual  report on sexual assault in the military and compared those reports with  requirements in the NDAA for FY 2011, which directs DOD to report the  total number of substantiated and unsubstantiated sexual assault  incidents, among other things. With regard to sexual harassment data,  we interviewed officials in the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel  and Readiness\u2019 Office of Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity,  as well as officials from the Military Equal Opportunity offices in the Air  Force, Marine Corps, and Navy, and officials from the Army Sexual  Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention office. We collected and  compared data fields and data definitions from the Army, Navy, Marine  Corps, and Air Force offices that address sexual harassment. We  compared the data elements to determine whether the data elements and  definitions across the services are consistent.", "To identify the extent to which DOD has overarching efforts, including a  prevention strategy, to address unwanted sexual behaviors across the  continuum of harm, we met with officials in the Office of the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Readiness and DOD\u2019s Sexual Assault  Prevention and Response office. We reviewed our prior work and  provisions from the Government Performance and Results Act to identify  key elements that should be included in strategic plans as well as  standards for coordinating within agencies. Key elements include (1)  mission statement, (2) long-term goals, (3) strategies to achieve goals, (4)  external factors that could affect goals, (5) use of metrics to gauge  progress, and (6) evaluations of the plan to monitor goals and objectives.  We identified and reviewed coordinating mechanisms used by OSD and  the service offices that guide and oversee efforts to address unwanted  sexual behaviors. We reviewed DOD, RAND Corporation, and CDC  reports that addressed the continuum of harm and the relationship  between the various forms of unwanted sexual behaviors. We  interviewed officials from OSD and service-level Sexual Assault  Prevention and Response, Family Advocacy, and Military Equal  Opportunity offices and the Army\u2019s Sexual Harassment/Assault Response  and Prevention to identify the various efforts in which they participate. We  also collected and reviewed charters and meeting notes for integrated  product teams and working groups to identify their intended purposes,  their activities, their membership, and whether they involved multiple  offices addressing unwanted sexual behaviors. In identifying DOD\u2019s  collaborative efforts, we also reviewed our prior work on collaboration  among federal agencies but we did not assess the effectiveness of  department\u2019s collaborative efforts.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2016 to December  2017 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
