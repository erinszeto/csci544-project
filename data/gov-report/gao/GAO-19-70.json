The five  core security functions are:  Identify: Develop the organizational understanding to manage  cybersecurity risk to systems, assets, data, and capabilities.", "Protect: Develop and implement the appropriate safeguards to  ensure delivery of critical infrastructure services.", "Detect: Develop and implement the appropriate activities to identify  the occurrence of a cybersecurity event.", "Respond: Develop and implement the appropriate activities to take  action regarding a detected cybersecurity event.", "Recover: Develop and implement the appropriate activities to  maintain plans for resilience and to restore any capabilities or services  that were impaired due to a cybersecurity event.", "These core security functions are described in more detail in appendix II.", "For the identify core security function, we had examined CDC\u2019s reporting  for its hardware and software assets; analyzed risk assessments for the  eight selected mission-essential systems to determine whether threats  and vulnerabilities were being identified; reviewed risk assessments for  two facilities; analyzed CDC policies, procedures, and practices to  determine their effectiveness in providing guidance to personnel  responsible for securing information and information systems; and  analyzed security plans for the eight selected systems to determine if  those plans had been documented and updated according to federal  guidance. We also evaluated the risk assessments for two facilities that  housed the 8 mission-essential selected systems.", "For the protect core security function, we had examined access controls  for the 24 systems. These controls included the complexity and expiration  of password settings to determine if password management was being  enforced; administrative users\u2019 system access permissions to determine  whether their authorizations exceeded the access necessary to perform  their assigned duties; firewall configurations, among other things, to  determine whether system boundaries had been adequately protected;  and physical security controls to determine if computer facilities and  resources were being protected from espionage, sabotage, damage, and  theft.", "We also had examined configurations for providing secure data  transmissions across the network to determine whether sensitive data  were being encrypted. In addition, we had examined configuration  settings for routers, network management servers, switches, firewalls,  and workstations to determine if settings adhered to configuration  standards, and inspected key servers and workstations to determine if  critical patches had been installed and/or were up-to-date. Further, we  had examined training records to determine if employees and contractors  had received security awareness training according to federal  requirements, and whether personnel who have significant security  responsibilities had received training commensurate with those  responsibilities.", "For the detect core security function, we had analyzed centralized logging  and network traffic monitoring capabilities for key assets connected to the  network; analyzed CDC\u2019s procedures and results for assessing security  controls to determine whether controls for the eight selected mission- essential systems had been sufficiently tested at least annually and  based on risk. We also had reviewed the agency\u2019s implementation of  continuous monitoring practices to determine whether the agency had  developed and implemented a continuous monitoring strategy to manage  its information technology assets and monitor the security configurations  and vulnerabilities for those assets.", "For the respond core security function, we had reviewed CDC\u2019s  implementation of incident response practices, including an examination  of incident tickets for 11 incidents; and had examined the agency\u2019s  process for correcting identified deficiencies for the eight selected  mission-essential systems.", "For the recover core security function, we had examined contingency  plans for eight selected mission-essential systems to determine whether  those plans had been developed and tested. In assessing CDC\u2019s controls  associated with this function, as well as the other four core functions, we  had interviewed Office of the Chief Information Officer officials, as  needed.", "Within the core security functions, as appropriate, we had evaluated the  elements of CDC\u2019s information security program based on elements  required by FISMA. For example, we analyzed risk assessments, security  plans, security control assessments, and remedial action plans for each  of the 8 selected mission-essential systems. In addition, we had assessed  whether the agency had ensured staff had completed security awareness  training and whether those with significant security responsibilities  received commensurate training. We also had evaluated CDC\u2019s security  policies and procedures.", "To determine the reliability of CDC\u2019s computer-processed data for training  and incident response records, we had evaluated the materiality of the  data to our audit objective and assessed the data by various means,  including reviewing related documents, interviewing knowledgeable  agency officials, and reviewing internal controls. Through a combination  of methods, we concluded that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our work.", "To accomplish our second objective\u2014on CDC\u2019s actions to address the  previously identified security program and technical control deficiencies  and related recommendations\u2014we requested that the agency provide a status report of its actions to implement each of the recommendations.  For each recommendation that CDC indicated it had implemented as of  August 3, 2018, we examined supporting documents, observed or tested  the associated security control or procedure, and/or interviewed the  responsible agency officials to assess the effectiveness of the actions  taken to implement the recommendation or otherwise resolve the  underlying control deficiency. Based on this assessment and CDC status  reports, we defined the status of each recommendation into the following  3 categories: closed-implemented\u2014CDC had implemented the recommendation; open-partially implemented\u2014CDC had made progress toward, but  had not completed, implementing the recommendation; and open-not implemented\u2014CDC had not provided evidence that it had  acted to implement the recommendation.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2016 to December  2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: The National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework", "paragraphs": ["The National Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s cybersecurity  framework consists of five core functions: identify, protect, detect,  respond, and recover.
