The United States has not had an FMD outbreak since 1929, but FMD is present in much of the world. An FMD outbreak in the United States could have serious economic impacts, in part because trade partners would likely halt all imports of U.S. livestock and livestock products until the disease was eradicated. These imports were valued at more than $19 billion in 2017.", "GAO was asked to review USDA's efforts to prepare for an FMD outbreak. This report examines (1) USDA's planned approach for responding to an FMD outbreak; (2) challenges USDA would face in pursuing its response goals; and (3) how USDA identifies, prioritizes, and monitors corrective actions to mitigate the challenges. GAO observed a USDA FMD preparedness exercise; reviewed agency documents and nongeneralizable questionnaire responses from 29 respondents from federal and state government, livestock industries, and universities; and interviewed officials from federal and state governments and representatives of livestock industries and universities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) planned approach for responding to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) includes several strategies. These strategies generally rely on killing infected and susceptible animals, vaccinating uninfected animals, or a combination of both approaches. USDA would implement one or more of the strategies, depending on factors such as the outbreak's size and the resources available, according to agency documents.", "USDA would likely face significant challenges in pursuing its response goals of detecting, controlling, and containing FMD quickly; eradicating FMD while seeking to stabilize industry and the economy; and facilitating continuity of commerce in uninfected animals. GAO identified challenges in 11 areas\u2014including allocating a limited supply of FMD vaccine\u2014based on its review of USDA documents, responses to GAO's questionnaire, and interviews with agency officials and others with expertise on FMD. According to USDA, the agency may not have a sufficient supply of FMD vaccine to control more than a small outbreak because of limited resources to obtain vaccine. As shown below, the current vaccine supply would be sufficient to protect about 14 percent of Texas's cattle or about 4 percent of Iowa's swine; these states' cattle and swine populations are the nation's largest. The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 includes a provision to increase the FMD vaccine supply.", "USDA has identified dozens of corrective actions to mitigate the challenges of responding to an FMD outbreak, as called for in USDA procedures, but has not prioritized these corrective actions or monitored their completion, as also called for in its procedures. USDA has identified the corrective actions through exercises simulating FMD outbreaks, surveys, and lessons learned from other foreign animal disease outbreaks. However, USDA has not completed all of the corrective actions, including actions related to vaccination. Agency officials stated that they have not completed such corrective actions because they have been responding to outbreaks of other animal diseases and have limited resources. Without following agency procedures to prioritize and monitor corrective actions, USDA cannot ensure that it is allocating its resources to the most beneficial actions to prepare for a possible FMD outbreak."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that USDA follow its procedures to prioritize and monitor the completion of corrective actions that the agency has identified for FMD preparedness.

The virus affects domestic  and wild cloven-hoofed animals, such as cattle, swine, sheep, goats,  bison, and deer. There are no known cases of FMD in the United States  as of January 2019, but it is present in more than two-thirds of countries  in the world, so it could be introduced here either accidentally or  intentionally as an act of terrorism, according to documents from the U.S.  Department of Agriculture (USDA). An FMD outbreak in the United  States could severely harm the economy, largely because of trade  repercussions from loss of our nation\u2019s \u201cFMD-free\u201d status. If the United  States lost this status, trading partners would likely be unwilling to accept  our exports until the United States is declared FMD-free again. As a  result, USDA expects that in an FMD outbreak, all exports of cattle,  swine, sheep, goats, and uncooked products from these animals would  temporarily stop. Beef exports in 2017 were valued at about $7 billion,  and pork exports were valued at about $6 billion, according to the U.S.  Meat Export Federation. Depending on the extent and duration of an FMD  outbreak, it could have a significant effect on these exports, as well as the  larger agricultural economy.", "USDA is responsible for preparing for an outbreak of FMD in the United  States and coordinating a response if an outbreak occurs, in partnership  with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), individual states, and  industry. USDA\u2019s goals for its FMD response are to (1) detect, control,  and contain FMD as quickly as possible; (2) eradicate FMD using  strategies to stabilize animal agriculture, the food supply, the economy,  and to protect public health; and (3) provide science- and risk-based  approaches and systems to facilitate continuity of commerce in uninfected  animals.", "Some countries have addressed FMD outbreaks in the past by killing and  disposing of infected and susceptible animals, otherwise known as  stamping out. However, South Korea and Japan stamped out millions of  swine and cattle in recent FMD outbreaks but still struggled to contain the  virus. U.S. livestock industries operate on a much larger scale than those  in either South Korea or Japan, which could make stamping out an  outbreak here more difficult. Some countries have used vaccination in  conjunction with stamping out to control FMD.", "You asked us to review USDA\u2019s efforts to prepare for an FMD outbreak.  This report (1) describes USDA\u2019s planned approach for responding to an  FMD outbreak; (2) identifies what challenges, if any, USDA would face in  pursuing its FMD response goals; and (3) examines how USDA identifies,  prioritizes, and monitors corrective actions to mitigate these challenges.", "To describe USDA\u2019s planned approach for responding to an FMD  outbreak, we reviewed relevant legislation and USDA strategy and  guidance documents. We also interviewed USDA officials at the agency\u2019s  headquarters, laboratories, center for epidemiology and animal health,  and center for veterinary biologics. We selected these officials to  interview because of their knowledge about USDA\u2019s planned approach,  their involvement in preparing for an FMD outbreak, and the roles they  would play in responding to such an outbreak.", "To identify what challenges, if any, USDA would face in pursuing its FMD  response goals, we first came up with a list of potential challenge areas.  To develop the list of potential challenge areas, we reviewed USDA  documents, reports about FMD outbreaks in other countries, and after- action reports from 41 preparedness exercises in the United States from  2007 to 2018 in which officials practiced responding to simulated FMD  outbreaks and identified emerging challenges. We also interviewed  USDA headquarters staff and field staff in Iowa (the state with the most  livestock); USDA laboratory officials; state animal health officials in  California, Colorado, Iowa, and North Carolina; representatives from four  different livestock industries; and others with expertise in this area. We  selected the individuals to interview based on their knowledge about  challenges that USDA could face in pursuing its FMD response goals,  their central role in preparing for an FMD outbreak, and recommendations  from other interviewees, as well as diversity in geographic location. We  also visited a swine farm and cattle feedlot in Iowa and interviewed the  owners. We selected a swine farm and cattle feedlot to visit because  swine and cattle were the livestock industries with the greatest  populations of animals in the United States in 2016. We identified a list of  11 potential challenge areas, including vaccination.", "To confirm the significance of the challenge areas, we sent a  questionnaire with the list of potential challenge areas to four categories  of individuals: federal government officials, state government officials,  livestock industry representatives, and academic researchers. Within the  categories, we selected individuals from relevant units within USDA and  DHS, states with relatively high livestock populations, different livestock  industries (beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, and sheep), and academic  researchers with relevant expertise. We asked the recipients whether  USDA would face a significant challenge in each of the 11 areas and  whether they knew of other challenge areas we had not listed. We  defined significant to mean a challenge that is sufficiently great or  important enough to be worthy of USDA action. We sent the  questionnaire to 39 recipients and received responses from 29. Since we  used a nonprobability sample, the results are not generalizable to all  government officials, livestock industry representatives, or FMD experts,  but the responses helped confirm the list of 11 challenge areas and  provided illustrative information about each one.", "We reviewed challenges related to vaccination for FMD in greater depth  than other challenges because of the significant role vaccination could  play if reliance solely on stamping out is not feasible. Specifically, we  visited DHS\u2019s Plum Island Animal Disease Center on Plum Island, New  York, where we interviewed officials from USDA\u2019s Foreign Animal  Disease Diagnostic Laboratory and others about challenges related to  FMD vaccination. We also reviewed agency documents on the topic and  interviewed other officials from USDA, universities, states, and industry  groups about issues related to FMD vaccination. Further, we interviewed  officials from the vaccine company that currently produces the majority of  FMD vaccine available for use in the United States and a company that  has exclusive rights to use a modified version of the FMD virus to  produce FMD vaccine in the future.", "To determine how USDA identifies, prioritizes, and monitors corrective  actions to mitigate the challenges, we reviewed related USDA guidance  and other agency documents, observed an FMD preparedness exercise,  reviewed after-action reports from 41 previous FMD preparedness  exercises, and interviewed USDA officials. The FMD preparedness  exercises were sponsored by USDA, DHS, and state governments, and  ranged from small-scale exercises focused on narrow response tasks to  large-scale exercises in which participants practiced a wide range of  response activities in a simulated outbreak. We reviewed USDA\u2019s  procedures for evaluation and improvement planning to understand how  the agency is to identify, prioritize, and monitor corrective actions. To  determine whether USDA was consistently following these procedures,  we reviewed the 41 after-action reports for FMD preparedness exercises  and interviewed agency officials about corrective actions identified in the  reports and steps the agency has taken to prioritize and monitor progress  on the actions. We reviewed agency documents and interviewed agency  officials about examples of corrective actions that USDA has identified  and taken or not yet taken. We also reviewed USDA after-action reports  for outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (avian influenza) and  reviewed USDA\u2019s database of related corrective actions to learn how the  agency identified, prioritized, and monitored actions to mitigate  challenges for that disease. To assess the overall reliability of the  database to use information from this database in our report, we reviewed  management controls over the information systems that maintain the  data, and we interviewed USDA officials who manage the database. We  determined that the database was sufficiently reliable to allow us to  describe the contents of the database and general status of corrective  actions. For further details on our objectives, scope, and methodology,  see appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2017 to March 2019 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The  disease generally does not infect humans and is not considered a public  health or food safety threat. Young animals may die from the virus, while  most adult animals recover. However, livestock infected with FMD have  severely diminished meat and milk production.", "FMD virus can be found in all secretions and excretions from infected  animals, including in breath, saliva, milk, urine, feces, and semen, as well  as in the fluid from the lesions. Animals can release the virus for up to 4  days before showing visible signs of infection, and FMD can spread from  one animal species to another. The virus itself can survive in the  environment for many months and can spread when healthy animals  come into contact with infected animals or via contaminated vehicles,  equipment, clothes, feed, or animal products, as shown in figure 2.", "The United States has not had an FMD outbreak since 1929, but the  disease could be introduced here from countries in Africa, Asia, Eastern  Europe, or South America where it is present. The United States is  vulnerable to FMD transmission, given the large size and mobility of the  U.S. livestock sector. In 2018, the United States had about 94 million  head of cattle, 74 million swine, 5 million sheep, and more than 2 million  goats. Many of these livestock are concentrated in major livestock- producing states such as Texas and Iowa, but livestock are present in  every state. (See figs. 3 and 4 for the populations of cattle and swine by  state.) According to USDA documents, a large percentage of livestock in  the United States are kept on large farms, ranches, or feedlots (i.e., areas  or buildings where livestock are fed and fattened up), some with capacity  for 50,000 to 100,000 or more animals. Livestock are transported daily to  feeding facilities, markets, slaughter plants, and other farms or ranches.  For example, swine are often moved among multiple premises at different  stages of their life spans to accommodate their growth in size, among  other things. According to the swine industry, approximately 1 million  swine are on the road every day in transit to various stages of the  production process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Impact of FMD Outbreak", "paragraphs": ["An FMD outbreak in the United States could have serious economic  consequences. A 2001 outbreak of FMD in the United Kingdom, for  example, resulted in the killing of more than 6 million animals, with direct  costs of more than $3 billion to the public sector and more than $5 billion  to the private sector. The extent of economic damage in the United  States would depend primarily on the duration and geographic extent of  the outbreak, the extent of trade disruptions, and how consumers reacted  to the disease and associated control measures, according to USDA. In a  large and long-lasting outbreak, control measures such as killing animals  and halting the transportation of animals could cause significant losses for  livestock operations. In addition, trade disruptions could have an  enormous impact because U.S. exports of livestock, meat, and dairy  products\u2014together valued at more than $19 billion in 2017 based on  estimates from the U.S. Meat Export Federation and the U.S. Dairy  Export Council\u2014would likely stop or be sharply reduced.

These strategies rely on  stamping out\u2014killing and disposing of\u2014infected and susceptible animals,  vaccination of uninfected animals, or both. For strategies involving  vaccination, options include killing and disposing of vaccinated animals  (vaccinate-to-kill), allowing the animals to be slaughtered and their meat  processed (vaccinate-to-slaughter), or allowing the animals to live out  their useful lifespan (vaccinate-to-live). Response strategies would likely  change as an outbreak unfolds, and might also vary by region or type of  animal affected, according to APHIS planning documents.", "Over time, USDA\u2019s FMD planned approach has evolved from relying  solely on stamping out to including vaccination strategies as it became  apparent that in many potential scenarios, reliance on stamping out alone  would not be effective or feasible. Specifically, in 2010, USDA\u2019s Foot-and- Mouth Disease Response Plan: The Red Book (Red Book) first stated  that APHIS would consider vaccination strategies such as vaccinate-to- slaughter and vaccinate-to-live. In 2014 APHIS updated the Red Book  with the addition of a vaccinate-to-kill strategy to better distinguish what  would happen to animals if they were not eligible for slaughter. By 2016,  USDA had determined that complete stamping out of anything beyond a  small FMD outbreak was not a viable, effective, or sustainable response  strategy for the United States, according to USDA\u2019s FMD vaccination  policy.", "Experiences in preparedness exercises and foreign outbreaks of FMD  influenced a shift in USDA\u2019s planned approach toward vaccination  strategies. In 2010, Japan and South Korea both experienced FMD  outbreaks and initially relied on stamping out combined with strict  movement restrictions. Japan stamped out about 300,000 cattle and  swine, and South Korea stamped out about 150,000 cattle and 3 million  swine\u2014a third of the country\u2019s total swine population. Despite these  efforts, FMD continued to spread in both countries until they implemented  vaccination strategies, according to USDA documents. A 2007 FMD  preparedness exercise, sponsored by the Texas Animal Health  Commission and USDA, found that killing and disposing of infected  animals in a livestock-dense area like the Texas panhandle would not be  feasible in a timely manner because of the large number of animals on  infected premises (e.g., 50,000 to 75,000 head of cattle on large cattle  feedlots). USDA learned that having vaccination strategies in place would  be necessary to effectively respond to an FMD outbreak.", "If an FMD outbreak occurred, APHIS would select a response strategy or  multiple strategies, or it would modify strategies to achieve its FMD  response goals based on the unique circumstances of the outbreak,  according to agency planning documents. APHIS would do so in  consultation with affected states and tribes, and if the agency chose to  use vaccine, states would request it from USDA. According to agency  planning documents we reviewed, APHIS would consider a number of  factors when deciding on its approach, including the following:", "FMD vaccine availability;  consequences of the outbreak (e.g., trade restrictions or loss of  valuable genetic stock); public acceptance of response strategy or strategies;  scale of the outbreak (i.e., number and size of infected premises);  rate of outbreak spread;  location of initial outbreak (e.g., isolated ranch versus livestock- producing area); movement of animals (number of locations that infected or potentially  infected animals have traveled to or through); and  federal and state resources available to implement response  strategies.", "Resource needs vary among strategies and generally increase with the  scale of an outbreak, according to USDA planning documents. Having the  necessary resources available to implement a stamping-out response  strategy would include having qualified personnel to kill animals in  accordance with accepted protocols and having appropriate disposal  facilities. To implement strategies involving vaccination, APHIS would  need a sufficient quantity of vaccine, the resources for distributing and  administering the vaccine, and the diagnostic tests necessary to  distinguish between vaccinated and infected animals, according to  USDA\u2019s FMD vaccination policy. If the scale of an outbreak were small,  and APHIS had access to sufficient resources, agency officials would  likely implement a stamping-out strategy in an attempt to quickly stop the  production of virus in infected animals and limit the outbreak\u2019s spread,  according to agency planning documents. However, these planning  documents indicate that if the outbreak grew to a moderate regional, large  regional, national, or catastrophic scale, the resources required for  killing all infected and potentially infected animals, disposing of  carcasses, and paying compensation to livestock owners would quickly  multiply, and APHIS policy calls for strategies focused on vaccination,  according to USDA documents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USDA Has Developed a Range of Documents to Guide Its FMD Response Strategies", "paragraphs": ["Over time, USDA\u2019s APHIS has developed various documents to guide its  response to FMD, including overarching guidance for responding to FMD  and other foreign animal diseases, procedures with in-depth operational  details, and plans to secure the nation\u2019s food supply. To aid agency  officials in implementing FMD response strategies broadly, APHIS has  developed FMD response plans and guidance for responding to foreign  animal disease outbreaks more generally. For example, the Red Book  describes USDA\u2019s FMD response strategies; identifies the capabilities  needed to respond to an FMD outbreak; and provides guidance on the  critical activities required during the response, including time frames for  these activities. The Red Book is intended for responders at all levels of  government and industry partners. For example, if a state official or a  livestock owner wanted to know the steps to test and confirm a positive  case of FMD, the Red Book explains the process and has a flowchart to  illustrate the steps. APHIS also has developed response manuals that  provide guidance relevant to foreign animal disease outbreaks, including  FMD. For example, a manual on roles and coordination provides an  overview of USDA\u2019s framework for incident management, funding,  communication strategies, relationships, and authorities during a foreign  animal disease outbreak, including an FMD outbreak. APHIS also has  produced ready reference guides that condense guidance material from  these broader documents into short summary documents for training and  education purposes.", "In addition, APHIS has developed standard operating procedures (SOP)  for many response activities. Some SOPs are specific to an FMD  outbreak, and others provide more general instruction on activities to  respond to foreign animal diseases. The FMD biosecurity SOP, for  example, describes steps responders at all levels of government and  industry partners can take to help prevent the spread of the virus, such as  protocols for putting on and taking off personal protective equipment (e.g.,  coverall suits, boots, and gloves); standards for separating \u201cclean\u201d and  \u201cdirty\u201d zones in vehicles and on premises; and instructions for cleaning  and disinfecting vehicles before arrival at and after departure from  different premises.", "Many of the more general SOPs have proven useful during outbreaks of  other animal diseases and exercises simulating FMD outbreaks,  according to APHIS and state government officials, and APHIS has  revised them to incorporate lessons learned. For example, one state  animal health official said that during the 2014 avian influenza outbreak,  the SOP for disposing of poultry carcasses through composting was  initially insufficient because the poultry industry had not previously been  composting in all states. To improve consistency across states, APHIS  updated protocols during the outbreak and created composting protocols  for avian influenza-infected flocks and livestock to supplement the  agency\u2019s disposal SOP, which addresses carcass disposal for foreign  animal diseases generally.

In contrast, for initial detection of other diseases, such as  bovine spongiform encephalopathy (commonly known as mad cow  disease), USDA has active surveillance programs in which animals are  routinely tested regardless of visible signs. According to USDA officials,  the cost and resources required to conduct active surveillance for initial  detection of an FMD outbreak would not be justified because the United  States has not had an FMD outbreak for decades and there is a risk that  false positives could create unnecessary disruptions. However, the  officials said the agency would likely use active surveillance during an  outbreak.", "Passive surveillance, however, may not allow for timely detection of the  initial cases of FMD, particularly in sheep. FMD infection in sheep often  causes only mild signs or symptoms, such as an elevated temperature or  loose stool, and in some cases will not cause any overt signs or  symptoms at all, even though the animal may be spreading the virus,  according to representatives of the sheep industry. Therefore, an FMD  outbreak could become widespread before USDA detects the first cases.", "Even if responders are able to detect FMD in domesticated animals  before an outbreak becomes widespread, wild animals may become  infected and spread the virus, posing additional challenges for USDA and  its partners. For example, the U.S. population of feral swine, which are  susceptible to FMD, is estimated at 6 million and is rapidly expanding,  according to APHIS. Detecting and controlling infected wild animals could  be extremely difficult, according to agency officials, and if not controlled,  these populations could serve as carriers for the disease.

Similarly, after-action reports for 2013  and 2016 preparedness exercises highlighted the need for procedures to  guide the implementation of FMD vaccination strategies. APHIS has  taken or planned several steps to help address this need:  In 2009, APHIS began drafting vaccine implementation procedures  but realized that the national procedures needed to be developed in  collaboration with states because of variation among states in their  predominant industries, agriculture infrastructure, and government  resources. When more states have developed vaccination  implementation procedures, APHIS may revise and finalize the  national procedures originally drafted in 2009, according to agency  officials.", "APHIS\u2019s National Veterinary Stockpile developed plans in 2009 and  2011 outlining how some aspects of a vaccination strategy would be  implemented. Specifically, in 2009 it developed a template that  states and tribes can use to develop their own plans, and in 2011 it  prepared a logistical plan for distributing FMD vaccine to the field. The  National Veterinary Stockpile also held preparedness exercises from  2008 to 2018 for states and tribes to practice requesting, receiving,  and delivering the vaccine and to obtain information that could help  APHIS develop national vaccination procedures.", "From 2011 to 2018, APHIS and the California Department of Food  and Agriculture worked together to draft detailed procedures for  implementing an FMD vaccination strategy in California. The draft  procedures and related planning documents are intended to serve as  templates to help other states develop such procedures, according to  agency officials. APHIS also piloted a workshop on FMD vaccination  planning in October 2018 and plans to hold related preparedness  exercises with states from 2019 to 2021."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "APHIS Does Not Consistently Follow Its Procedures for Prioritizing Corrective Actions and Monitoring Their Completion", "paragraphs": ["Although APHIS has identified dozens of corrective actions for FMD  preparedness, it has not consistently followed its SOP for prioritizing all of  the actions and monitoring progress in implementing them. Specifically,  once corrective actions have been identified, APHIS\u2019s SOP calls for  prioritizing the actions in an improvement plan, and monitoring the actions  to track their completion. APHIS has sometimes designated actions  related to FMD vaccination as high priority during annual management  meetings, but not all corrective actions have been prioritized, according to  agency officials. For example, a 2016 corrective action called for USDA to  conduct an exercise to explore roles, responsibilities, and activities  related to recovery from a large-scale animal disease outbreak. However,  as of December 2018, this action has not been prioritized in an  improvement plan, according to the after-action report and an agency  official.", "In addition, corrective actions have sometimes been identified multiple  times without being tracked to completion. For example, an after-action  report for a 2007 exercise found that a process for making vaccine- allocation decisions was needed and suggested that a vaccine advisory  group could assist with doing so. A 2014 after-action report stated that  processes governing vaccine prioritization and allocation were not clear  and identified a corrective action calling for USDA to develop a federal- level doctrine for vaccine prioritization and allocation. USDA\u2019s 2016 FMD  vaccination policy states that APHIS, in coordination with state, local, and  industry stakeholders, should consider developing processes,  procedures, and strategies for prioritizing the use of currently available  vaccine in an outbreak. However, APHIS has not developed processes,  procedures, or strategies for prioritizing and allocating its supply of FMD  vaccine, according to agency officials. The officials said they have not  developed such a process because of limited resources and competing  priorities. Also, it would require participation from state and industry  stakeholders, and given the small quantity of FMD vaccine relative to the  large number of susceptible animals in the country, the stakeholders have  had little incentive to devote the necessary time to the issue, according to  agency officials.", "More generally, agency officials told us that the agency has not prioritized  or monitored completion of some corrective actions because they have  been responding to actual outbreaks of animal and plant diseases. They  also noted that they have limited resources for FMD preparedness, which  may make it difficult for them to complete all of the corrective actions that  have been identified. However, for avian influenza preparedness, APHIS  compiled and prioritized more than 300 corrective actions in a database  and tracked more than 200 of them to completion. Through this process,  it completed nearly all of the 111 high-priority actions and over 100  moderate-priority actions, according to its database as of May 2018. For  example after the 2014 avian influenza outbreak, APHIS completed  corrective actions that improved its response to a subsequent outbreak in  2016, according to agency documents. The corrective actions addressed  such issues as how to quickly depopulate and dispose of infected poultry  and efficiently compensate affected producers. APHIS continues to  monitor its progress in implementing the remaining corrective actions for  that disease, according to agency officials.", "APHIS\u2019s SOP calls for prioritizing corrective actions to identify the most  beneficial use of resources. The SOP also calls for monitoring corrective  actions to track their completion so that APHIS can improve its response  capabilities and correct problems or deficiencies identified in exercises or  incidents. Without following its SOP to prioritize corrective actions for  FMD preparedness, APHIS cannot ensure that it is allocating its limited  resources toward implementing the most beneficial actions. And without  following its SOP for monitoring the corrective actions, APHIS cannot  ensure that the highest-priority actions are completed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["APHIS has taken important steps to prepare for an FMD outbreak and to  mitigate challenges it may face in responding to one.

However, APHIS has not yet completed other corrective  actions, including actions that have been identified multiple times, such as  developing a process for prioritizing and allocating the limited supply of  FMD vaccine.", "APHIS has an SOP for prioritizing and monitoring corrective actions. By  following this SOP for avian influenza preparedness, the agency  succeeded in prioritizing more than 300 corrective actions and tracking  over 200 corrective actions to completion, including nearly all high-priority  actions.

We also interviewed officials from USDA\u2019s Animal  and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) at the agency\u2019s  headquarters in Riverdale, Maryland; laboratories on Plum Island, New  York, and in Ames, Iowa; center for epidemiology and animal health in  Fort Collins, Colorado; and center for veterinary biologics in Ames, Iowa;  and officials from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the  Agricultural Research Service (ARS) at DHS\u2019s Plum Island Animal  Disease Center on Plum Island, New York. We selected these officials to  interview because of their knowledge about USDA\u2019s planned approach,  their involvement in preparing for an FMD outbreak, and the roles they  would play in responding to such an outbreak.", "To identify what challenges, if any, USDA would face in pursuing its FMD  response goals, we first came up with a list of potential challenge areas.  To develop the list of potential challenge areas, we reviewed USDA  documents, reports about FMD outbreaks in other countries, and after- action reports from 41 preparedness exercises in the United States from  2007 to 2018 in which officials practiced responding to simulated FMD  outbreaks and identified emerging challenges. The preparedness  exercises included small-scale as well as large-scale ones with a variety  of participants, durations, and response activities. We also interviewed  APHIS headquarters staff and field staff in Iowa (the state with the most  livestock); APHIS and ARS laboratory officials; state animal health  officials in California, Colorado, Iowa, and North Carolina; representatives  from the beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, and sheep industries; and  academic researchers with expertise in this area. We selected the  individuals to interview based on their knowledge about challenges that  USDA could face in pursuing its FMD response goals, their central role in  preparing for an FMD outbreak, and recommendations from other  interviewees, as well as diversity in geographic location. We also visited a  swine farm and cattle feedlot in Iowa and interviewed the owners. We  selected a swine farm and cattle feedlot to visit because swine and cattle  were the livestock industries with the greatest populations of animals in  the United States in 2016. We identified a list of 11 potential challenge  areas.", "To confirm the significance of the challenge areas, we used a  questionnaire with the list of potential challenge areas. To select the  questionnaire recipients, we identified four categories of people who are  knowledgeable about challenges that USDA could face in pursuing its  FMD response goals, including those who could be involved in a  response effort. The four categories are (1) federal government officials,  (2) state government officials, (3) livestock industry representatives, and  (4) academic researchers with expertise in FMD preparedness. For  categories with multiple individuals, we selected individuals to represent  relevant units within APHIS, ARS, and DHS (e.g. headquarters; field  offices; laboratories; surveillance, preparedness and response services;  and science, technology, and analysis services); different livestock  industries (beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, and sheep); and states with  relatively high livestock populations. We asked the recipients whether  USDA would face a significant challenge in each of the 11 areas and  whether they knew of other challenge areas we had not listed. We  defined significant to mean a challenge that is sufficiently great or  important enough to be worthy of USDA action to address the challenge.", "We initially sent the questionnaire with potential challenges to 39  recipients. Two federal officials had retired from their positions, so we  sent the list to their replacements. Of the 39 recipients, we received  responses from 28. We also included an additional response that APHIS  provided from an official who we had not initially contacted and who had  relevant expertise, for a total of 29 responses. Despite two follow-up  attempts, we did not receive responses from 11 recipients, including both  recipients from ARS, 5 of the 18 from APHIS, 3 of the 10 state animal  health officials, and 1 of the 2 national animal health laboratory network  officials (these are affiliated with universities). Figure 7 shows the  categories of respondents and their responses in each of the11 challenge  areas.", "Since we used a nonprobability sample, the results are not generalizable  to all government officials, livestock industry officials, or FMD experts, but  the responses helped confirm the list of 11 challenge areas and provided  illustrative information about each one.", "We reviewed challenges related to vaccination for FMD in greater depth  than other challenges because of the significant role vaccination could  play if reliance solely on stamping out is not feasible. Specifically, we  visited DHS\u2019s Plum Island Animal Disease Center on Plum Island, New  York, where we interviewed officials from USDA\u2019s Foreign Animal  Disease Diagnostic Laboratory and the Agricultural Research Service, as  well as DHS officials, about challenges related to FMD vaccination. We  also reviewed agency documents on the topic and interviewed other  officials from USDA, the North American Vaccine Bank, universities,  states, and industry groups about issues related to FMD vaccination.  Further, we interviewed officials from the vaccine company that currently  produces the majority of FMD vaccine available for use in the United  States and a company that has rights to use a modified version of the  FMD virus to produce FMD vaccine in the future.", "To determine how USDA identifies, prioritizes, and monitors corrective  actions to mitigate the challenges, we reviewed APHIS and DHS  guidance on evaluation and improvement planning and other agency  documents, observed an FMD preparedness exercise, reviewed after- action reports from 41 FMD preparedness exercises conducted from  2007 through 2018, and interviewed USDA officials. We reviewed  APHIS\u2019s and DHS\u2019s procedures for evaluation and improvement planning  to understand how APHIS is to identify, prioritize, and monitor corrective  actions. To determine whether APHIS was consistently following these  procedures, we observed the preparedness exercise at APHIS\u2019s  Riverdale, Maryland, office; reviewed a preliminary after-action report for  that exercise; and reviewed after-action reports for the 41 other  preparedness exercises. We interviewed APHIS officials about corrective  actions identified in the after-action reports and what steps the agency  has taken to prioritize the actions and monitor their progress. We  reviewed agency documents about these procedures and about actions  USDA has taken and identified but not yet taken to mitigate challenges.  To find examples of corrective actions that USDA has identified and taken  or not yet taken, we reviewed after-action reports for the 41 preparedness  exercises; APHIS\u2019s 2018-2020 training and exercise plan for its veterinary  services emergency preparedness and response unit; and other agency  documents, such as contracts and plans, and interviewed agency  officials. The examples of corrective actions in table 1 are illustrative only  and do not include or represent all of the actions that USDA has  identified. We sent a draft table of examples to APHIS officials and  incorporated their comments as appropriate.", "We also reviewed a GAO report on USDA\u2019s management of highly  pathogenic avian influenza (avian influenza) outbreaks; interviewed  agency officials; reviewed USDA after-action reports for avian influenza  outbreaks; and reviewed USDA\u2019s database of related corrective actions to  learn how the agency identifies, prioritizes, and monitors actions to  mitigate challenges for that disease. To assess the overall reliability of  that database to use information from the database in our report, we  reviewed management controls over the information systems that  maintain the data and interviewed USDA officials who manage the  database.
