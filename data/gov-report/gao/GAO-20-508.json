Together, these three programs funded $2.3 billion in mitigation projects from fiscal years 2014 through 2018. The largest program's funding is tied to federal recovery dollars following presidential disaster declarations, while the other two programs are funded each year through congressional appropriations. States and localities generally must contribute 25 percent of the cost of a mitigation project, but some other federal program funds can be used for that purpose. One example of such a project is property acquisition\u2014purchasing a high-risk property from a willing property owner, demolishing the structure, and converting the property to green space.", "From 1989 to 2018, FEMA has helped states and localities mitigate more than 50,000 properties; however, the number of nonmitigated repetitive loss properties (generally meaning those that flooded at least twice in 10 years) has grown. Mitigation efforts varied by state. Property acquisition accounted for about 80 percent of mitigated properties nationwide, but, in some states, elevation (raising a structure) was more commonly used. In addition, some states (e.g., Missouri and North Carolina) mitigated a high number of properties relative to their numbers of repetitive loss properties, while others (Florida, New York, Louisiana, and Texas) mitigated a low number.", "While these efforts can reduce flood risk and claim payments, the federal government's fiscal exposure from NFIP remains high because premium rates do not fully reflect the flood risk of its insured properties. NFIP has experienced several catastrophic flood events in recent years, and the frequency and severity of floods is expected to increase. However, NFIP's premium rates have not provided sufficient revenue to pay claims. As a result, FEMA still owed Treasury $20.5 billion as of March 2020, despite Congress cancelling $16 billion of debt in 2017.

The magnitude of major flood events since 2005,  combined with attempts to keep policyholder rates affordable, have  resulted in insufficient premium revenue, which threatens the program\u2019s  ability to pay claims over the long term. Compounding these challenges is  a small subset of NFIP-insured properties known as repetitive loss (RL)  properties, which have flooded and received a claim payment multiple  times. These factors have resulted in NFIP accruing billions of dollars in  debt, as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has  repeatedly borrowed from the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) to  pay claims.

One such method is property  acquisition, where FEMA provides funding for the purchase of a property  from a willing property owner, demolishes the structure, and converts the  property to green space. These properties no longer pose a flood risk,  and the green space can alleviate flooding of other properties.

According to  FEMA, NFIP was designed to address the policy objectives of identifying  flood hazards, offering affordable insurance premiums to encourage  program participation, and promoting community-based floodplain  management. To meet these policy objectives, NFIP has four key  elements: identifying and mapping flood hazards, floodplain management,  flood insurance, and incentivizing flood-risk reduction through grants and  premium discounts. NFIP enables property owners in participating  communities to purchase flood insurance and, in exchange, the  community agrees to adopt and enforce NFIP minimum floodplain  management regulations and applicable building construction standards  to help reduce future flood losses. A participating community\u2019s floodplain  management regulations must meet or exceed NFIP\u2019s minimum  regulatory requirements.", "Insurance offered through NFIP includes different coverage levels and  premium rates, which are determined by factors that include property  characteristics, location, and statutory provisions. NFIP coverage limits  vary by program (Regular or Emergency) and building occupancy (for  example, residential or nonresidential). In NFIP\u2019s Regular Program, the  maximum coverage limit for one-to-four family residential policies is  $250,000 for buildings and $100,000 for contents. For nonresidential or  multifamily policies, the maximum coverage limit is $500,000 per building  and $500,000 for the building owner\u2019s contents. Separate coverage is  available for contents owned by tenants.

According  to FEMA, floodplain management standards are designed to prevent new  development from increasing the flood threat and to protect new and  existing buildings from anticipated flooding. FEMA has a division  responsible for flood mapping activities and policy and guidance, but stakeholders from various levels of government and the private sector  participate in the mapping process, as appropriate.", "A community\u2019s Flood Insurance Rate Map serves several purposes. They  provide the basis for setting insurance premium rates and identifying  properties whose owners are required to purchase flood insurance. Since  the 1970s, homeowners with federally backed mortgages or mortgages  held by federally regulated lenders on property in a special flood hazard  area have been required to purchase flood insurance. Others may  purchase flood insurance voluntarily if they live in a participating  community. The maps also provide the basis for establishing minimum  floodplain management standards that communities must adopt and  enforce as part of their NFIP participation.

Through this process, a local or state government purchases land and  structures that flooded or are at risk from future floods from willing sellers  and demolishes the structures. The community restricts future  development on the land, which is maintained as open space in  perpetuity to restore and conserve the natural floodplain functions.  According to FEMA officials, an advantage of property acquisition is that it  offers a permanent solution to flood risks, whereas other mitigation  methods make properties safer from floods but not immune. Property  acquisition and demolition is a voluntary process, and property owners  are paid fair market value for their land and structures. Acquisition is  typically done on a community-wide scale, purchasing several or all  properties in an at-risk neighborhood. Acquisition projects typically require  building consensus from property owners and sustained communication  and collaboration between residents and the government executing the  project.", "Acquisition and relocation (relocation) refers to purchasing a structure  and moving it to another location instead of demolishing it. Through this  process, state or local governments use FEMA funding to help purchase  land from willing sellers and assist the property owners with relocating the structure.

Relocation is a voluntary process and property owners  are paid fair market value for their land.", "Elevation involves raising a structure so that the lowest occupied floor is  at or above the area\u2019s base flood elevation. Structure elevation may be  achieved through a variety of methods, including elevating on continuous  foundation walls; elevating on open foundations, such as piles, piers, or  columns; and elevating on fill. Structures proposed for elevation must be  structurally sound and capable of being elevated safely. Further, elevation  projects must be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation,  collapse, and lateral movement of the structure from flooding, waves, and  wind.", "Floodproofing falls into two categories: dry floodproofing and wet  floodproofing. Dry floodproofing involves sealing a structure to prevent  floodwater from entering. Examples of dry floodproofing measures include  using waterproof coatings or coverings to make walls impermeable to  water, installing waterproof shields, and installing devices that prevent  sewer and drain backup. Dry floodproofing is appropriate only where  floodwaters do not exceed three feet, the speed of flood waters is low,  and the duration of flooding is relatively short because walls and floors  may collapse from the pressure of higher water levels. Wet floodproofing  involves changing a structure to allow floodwaters to enter and exit with  minimal damage. Wet floodproofing is used in parts of a structure that are  not used as living space, such as a crawlspace, basement, or garage.  Examples of wet floodproofing measures include installing flood openings  in the foundation and enclosure walls below the base flood elevation,  using flood-resistant building materials and furnishings located below the  base flood elevation, and either elevating or floodproofing all utility  systems and associated equipment to protect them from damage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Mitigation Grant Programs", "paragraphs": ["FEMA administers three HMA grant programs that can be used to fund  flood mitigation projects: the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP),  Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM), and Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA).

As we have been  reporting since 1983, NFIP\u2019s premium rates do not reflect the full risk of  loss because of various legislative requirements and FEMA practices.  To set premium rates, FEMA considers several factors, including location  in flood zones, elevation of the property relative to the community\u2019s base  flood elevation, and characteristics of the property, such as building type,  number of floors, presence of a basement, and year built relative to the  year of the community\u2019s original flood map.

NFIP offers some policyholders subsidized rates\u2014that  is, rates that intentionally do not reflect the full risk of flooding. These  premium rates are intended to encourage the widespread purchase of  flood insurance by property owners and encourage floodplain  management by communities. Subsidized rates generally are offered to  properties in high-risk locations (special flood hazard areas) that were  built before flood maps were created. FEMA staff said they have begun  increasing rates for certain subsidized properties as prescribed under the  Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 and the Homeowner  Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014.

According to FEMA data, the  percentage of NFIP policies receiving subsidized rates dropped from  about 22 percent in July 2013 to about 17 percent in June 2019.", "In 2013, we recommended that FEMA obtain elevation information to  determine full-risk rates for subsidized properties. As of January 2020,  FEMA had not fully implemented this recommendation but was in the  process of doing so. For example, FEMA had requested proposals from  third-party vendors for obtaining the elevation information and was  reviewing these proposals. This information remains necessary for FEMA  to determine the adequacy of its premium rates and the costs of any  subsidization. It will also allow Congress and the public to understand the  amount of unfunded subsidization within the program and the federal  fiscal exposure it creates.", "Grandfathered rates. FEMA allows some property owners whose  properties are remapped into higher-risk flood zones to continue to pay  the premium rate from the lower-risk zone. FEMA data show that about  9 percent of NFIP policies were receiving a grandfathered rate as of June  2019.

Private insurers typically  manage catastrophic risk using capital, reinsurance, and other  instruments, such as catastrophe bonds, and include the associated  expenses in premium rates.", "By contrast, FEMA has traditionally managed catastrophic risk by relying  on its authority to borrow from Treasury. In January 2017, FEMA began  purchasing reinsurance to transfer some of its flood risk exposure to the  private reinsurance market. However, FEMA has not accounted for these  expenses in setting its NFIP premium rates. Reinsurance could be  beneficial because it would allow FEMA to recognize some of its flood risk  and the associated costs up front through the premiums it must pay to the  reinsurers rather than after the fact in borrowing from Treasury. However,  because reinsurers must charge FEMA premiums to compensate for the  risk they assume, reinsurance\u2019s primary benefit would be to manage risk  rather than to reduce NFIP\u2019s expected long-term fiscal exposure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Insufficient Premium Revenue Contributes to NFIP\u2019s Fiscal Exposure", "paragraphs": ["Congress has directed FEMA to provide discounted premium rates to  promote affordability for policyholders but did not provide FEMA with  dedicated funds to pay for these subsidies.

Decreasing costs to the program in  the form of claims involves mitigating insured properties\u2019 flood risks.  Mitigation can be very costly, but there will be some properties for which  the cost to mitigate will be outweighed by the benefit of reduced flood risk  and, ultimately, fiscal exposure.

Members of Congress and others have  raised concerns about such reforms because raising premium rates may  make coverage unaffordable for some policyholders. To address these  concerns, we suggested that all policies include full-risk premium rates,  with targeted, means-based, appropriated subsidies for some policies.  This would improve the program\u2019s solvency while also addressing  affordability concerns. Assigning full-risk premium rates to all policies  would remove subsidies from those who do not need them, helping  improve solvency. It would also more accurately signal the true flood risk  to property owners and enhance resilience by incentivizing mitigation  measures, such as acquisition. Means-based subsidies would ensure that  property owners who needed help would get it, and an explicit  appropriation for the subsidies would make their true cost transparent to  taxpayers.
