In addressing its truck armor requirements, the Marine Corps used a three-phased approach. In the first phase, the Marine Corps validated its initial requirement in January 2004 to armor 1,169 trucks for protection against IEDs and other similar threats. Due to the immediacy of the need to deploy forces to Iraq by March 2004, the Marine Corps installed interim armor that did not provide sufficient IED protection, which Marine Corps officials acknowledged, stating that their intent was to field some level of protection until a more robust armor solution became available. In the second phase, the Marine Corps increased its armor requirement to 1,438 trucks in April 2004 and fully met that requirement in September 2004 with armor that provided enhanced IED protection. In the third phase, the Marine Corps is upgrading to integrated armor for its 7-ton trucks, which provides improved protection because the armor is built into the body of the vehicle. They expect to complete installation by May 2006. Two factors affected the timely production and installation of Marine Corps truck armor. First, a lack of a synchronized approach between the Marine Corps and the Army on addressing truck armor requirements and solutions resulted in the Marine Corps identifying its truck armor requirements and seeking armor solutions 2 months after the Army. Consequently, this delay may have limited the Marine Corps' ability to field interim armor that met IED protection requirements in the first phase, and may have contributed to the time to provide add-on truck armor to deployed Marine Corps forces in the second phase. The Marine Corps did not officially identify a requirement for truck armor and did not begin seeking out armor materials from industry until January 2004--2 months after the Army began its truck armor program in November 2003. According to Marine Corps officials, the armor-grade steel needed for sufficient IED protection was not available from suppliers in time to meet the Marine Corps' deployment timeline of March 2004. As a result, the Marine Corps fielded the interim armor with only limited IED protection. Second, mission needs restricted the rate at which the Marine Corps could replace its interim armor with add-on armor and install integrated armor. The Marine Corps and DOD have taken actions to improve the timely availability of truck armor and other critical wartime equipment. For example, the Marine Corps increased the rate of installation for integrated armor by expanding its armor installation capacity. The Marine Corps is alsotaking longer-term actions, such as developing a plan to address the availability of truck armor for future operations. In addition, DOD established a joint requirements process to improve coordination and accelerate the process of fielding urgent wartime solutions. However, it is unclear whether this process applies to urgent wartime needs such as armor because it excludes the development of new technology solutions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["When combat operations were declared over during Operation Iraqi  When combat operations were declared over during Operation Iraqi  Freedom (OIF), U.S. and coalition forces transitioned to stabilization  Freedom (OIF), U.S. and coalition forces transitioned to stabilization  operations to restore public order and infrastructure in Iraq.

Recognizing that the interim armor provided limited protection  from IED fragments, the Marine Corps subsequently produced a more  robust solution of add-on armor for phase two that provided greater  protection against IEDs and roadside bombs. This add-on armor initially  included 3/8-inch rolled homogeneous armor (RHA) steel doors and side  panels, and ballistic glass. Later, as the threat became more lethal, the  Marine Corps began producing and installing additional add-on armor  coverage for phase two that included underbodies, roofs, tailgates, rear  cab plates, and gunner shields. To produce add-on armor kits, Systems  Command used its own Logistics Command to produce and ship the add- on armor kits.

Unlike add-on armor, integrated armor is a permanent modification and is  designed for the life of the vehicle. Integrated armor provides the greatest  level of protection through more comprehensive coverage. The integrated  truck armor kits are produced by Oshkosh Truck Corporation.

Industry officials told us that if the  Marine Corps had requested 3/8-inch RHA steel directly from them, they  could have made it available sooner despite a lead time that varied from 30  days to 4 months. In fact, according to industry officials, both the 3/16-inch  HHS and 3/8-inch RHA steel required the same amount of lead time.  Ultimately, in early February 2004, the Marine Corps approached industry  with the assistance of congressional staff, and by the end of February, 3/8- inch RHA steel became available.

However, the instruction  also allows the minor modification of an existing system to adapt to a new  or similar mission. Army officials said they were unclear whether urgent  wartime requirements such as armor should be processed under JUONS  given that the armor solution can be described as both an off-the-shelf  solution with minor modification and a solution that required the  development of new technology. For example, according to Army officials,  the recently fielded armor solutions were readily available off the shelf  and required some modification. However, officials also said that the  armor solutions can be described as new and developing technology  because research was needed to identify effective armor protection  standards and new technology was necessary to integrate and apply armor  onto vehicles. As a result, it is not clear if similar future requirements are  to be processed under JUONS or other requirements generation processes.  Until the types of solutions about which the JUONS process applies are  more clearly defined, it is uncertain whether this process would apply to  joint urgent wartime requirements for items needing some level of  research and development, such as truck armor."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The results of our work on Marine Corps truck armor indicate a broader  systemic problem with a lack of synchronization between the Marine  Corps and Army in identifying common urgent wartime requirements and  developing solutions to those requirements. Because there was no formal  process requiring a synchronized approach between the two services for  identifying requirements or developing solutions, the Marine Corps did not  identify a requirement for truck armor or begin developing armor  solutions until 2 months after the Army had done so. A more unified and  coordinated approach between the Marine Corps and the Army might have  allowed the Marine Corps to field a better interim armor solution that  provided sufficient protection against IEDs. In addition, earlier  coordination may also have enabled the Marine Corps to begin developing  and fielding its second phase of armor, which provided the required IED  protection, sooner. Further, due to the lack of a formal process for sharing  requirements information between the services, official documentation  was not available to determine whether the Marine Corps made informed  decisions about the materials it selected for its interim armor or to assess  the basis for these decisions. While the work we performed focused on the  Marine Corps and Army, the lack of a DOD-wide framework for  coordinating wartime requirements and solutions impacts on all of the  military services.", "Subsequent to the procurement and installation of Marine Corps add-on  truck armor, DOD established a new joint process, called JUONS, to  ensure that the development of wartime requirements common to the  Marine Corps, Army, and other services are coordinated. However,  because this new process does not apply to the development of new  technologies, it is not clear whether it will improve interservice  coordination when solutions involve some level of research and  development, like truck armor. Without a formal process for coordinating  all common wartime requirements and the development of materiel  solutions across military services, the Army, Marine Corps, and other  services could continue to develop different solutions with varying  degrees of effectiveness in response to the same warfighter needs. It is  likely that DOD will again face urgent wartime requirements common to  multiple services to rapidly develop materiel solutions to improve force  capability or protection of deployed forces. The effective coordination of  common requirements and sharing of information on materiel solutions in  development are critical to ensure the needs of the warfighter are met in  the timeliest and most effective manner possible. Without improved  coordination, deployed military personnel and their missions may be  placed at significant risk because they lack the appropriate equipment at  the critical times it may be needed. Furthermore, until a formal process for  coordinating and sharing information on all common urgent wartime  requirements and solutions is established, Congress and the Secretary of  Defense may be unable to exercise effective oversight of decisions made  to address urgent wartime requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that the services make informed and coordinated decisions  about what materiel solutions are developed and procured to address  common urgent wartime requirements, we recommend that the Secretary  of Defense take the following two actions: (1) direct the service  secretaries to establish a process to share information between the Marine  Corps and the Army on developed or developing materiel solutions, and  (2) clarify the point at which the JUONS process should be utilized when  materiel solutions require research and development."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, DOD generally agreed with  our recommendations. Regarding the first recommendation that DOD  direct the services to establish a process to share information between the  services on materiel solutions in development, DOD partially concurred,  and stated that it believes that multiple layers of communication already  exist between the Marine Corps and the Army. For example, DOD cited  the Marine Corps\u2019 participation in the Army\u2019s armor kit working group.  DOD also noted that the Marine Corps coordinated with the Army  Research Lab and the Army\u2019s Aberdeen Test Center on armor kit design  and testing. While we agree that the coordination between the Marine  Corps and Army on truck armoring was beneficial to the Marine Corps\u2019  program, these processes were generally informal in nature. As evidenced  in our report, these various layers of communication were not sufficient to  bring the services\u2019 two truck armor programs together in a more uniform  and coordinated approach from the beginning to ensure that requirements  were identified and solutions developed for both services at the same time.  Instead, the Army identified its first truck armor requirements and began  developing solutions in November 2003, while the Marine Corps did not  begin its program until January 2004. As we reported, had the Marine  Corps began seeking truck armor solutions in November 2003, if might  have been able to acquire the preferred type of steel in time for its March  2004 deployment to Iraq given the average lead times for this steel during  this time period and the willingness of industry to work with the Marine  Corps to expedite its availability.", "DOD further stated that it believes it met the intent of our  recommendation with the creation of the Army-Marine Corps Board and  the Navy-Marine Corps Board. As noted by DOD, these Boards address  issues at the 3-star level and provide a means to share information  between the services. According to DOD, the Army-Marine Corps Board  was not mature enough to influence the initial development of truck  armor, but in 2005 it was used to coordinate production delivery priority  between the Army and Marine Corps for the up-armored HMMWV. While  we agree that these Boards enhance the coordination between the two  services, they represent an agreement between the services, initiated by  the services. The intent of our recommendation is for DOD to develop a  more comprehensive DOD-wide process that requires synchronization and  coordination between the services in identifying common urgent wartime  requirements and developing solutions to those requirements.", "In response to our second recommendation to clarify the point at which  the JUONS process should be utilized, DOD concurred, stating that the  Joint Staff is working on an update to the JOUNS process instruction.  According to DOD, this update will clarify when and if the JOUNS process  can be used when materiel solutions require development of a new  technology or capability. The update is expected to be completed by  September 2006.", "DOD provided additional comments related to the context of the report.  Specifically, DOD noted that it believes the Marine Corps exhibited due  diligence in providing armor protection for its deployed tactical wheeled  vehicle fleet. It further described in detail the Marine Corps\u2019 approach to  first develop an interim solution using commercially available materials,  including 3/16-inch HHS, to ensure all vehicles entering Iraq would have at  least some protection until armor with a better level of protection could be  fielded. We agree that the Marine Corps exercised diligence in armoring its  trucks for Iraq and other deployed locations given the circumstances and  we believe this information is accurately presented in the report. However,  as noted in the report, a more unified and synchronized approach between  the Army and the Marine Corps may have improved the availability of the  preferred 3/8-inch RHA for the Marine Corps\u2019 interim armor.", "DOD also provided additional comments related to the accuracy of the  report which we have incorporated in the report as appropriate. The  department\u2019s specific comments and our responses to them are discussed  in detail in appendix III. In summary, the department disagreed with our  statements regarding the (1) lack of coordination between the Marine  Corps and the Army on addressing truck armor requirements and  solutions, (2) lack of a formal departmentwide process to ensure  interservice coordination, and (3) delays in the Marine Corps\u2019  identification of the requirement for 3/8-inch RHA and its attempts to  acquire and install this improved armor. While we acknowledge that the  Marine Corps made attempts to coordinate with the Army through various  informal processes, evidence showed that the lack of a synchronized  approach between the services led to differing processes within the  services for generating armor requirements and solutions. Similarly, while  we agree that the department had a number of interservice working  groups and committees designed to enhance interservice coordination, we  continue to believe that the lack of a more formal interservice  coordination process precluded the Marine Corps and the Army from  identifying armor requirements and solutions for both services at the same  time. Lastly, while the department refuted our evidence that the Marine  Corps did not identify a requirement for 3/8-inch RHA until April 2004, it  was unable to adequately document its position.

DOD stated that our statement identifying a number of systemic  causes for shortages in armor such as inaccurate requirements is  misleading and that it implies that the Marine Corps did not consider  the current threat analysis. However, this statement does not refer to  the Marine Corps\u2019s truck armor program. Rather, the statement is from  the introduction of the report, where we discussed our prior work  leading up to this review. Specifically, we noted that in April 2005 we  reported on a number of critical supply shortages during OIF\u2014 including armored HMMWVs, body armor, and other items\u2014and  inaccurate requirements was one of the systemic causes identified in  the April 2005 report.  2.  DOD disagreed with our statement that the Marine Corps\u2019 interim  armor did not meet requirements, noting that armor protection  requirements changed quickly over time and migrated from a small  arms ballistic focus to a fragmentation focus, as the lethality of IEDs  encountered increased. However, the December 2003 requirement  document that the Marine Corps provided to us during our review  clearly stated the need to protect all vehicles from improvised  explosive devices, mines, and other explosive ordnances. Documents  we obtained from both the Marine Corps and Army recognized IEDs as  a significant threat at the time. In fact, in DOD\u2019s comments to this  report, it noted that \u201cin December 2003, both the Army and Marine  Corps recognized that IEDs, RPGs, 7.62mm projectiles, and mines  were the predominate threats.\u201d Further, in November 2003, the Army  had identified a requirement to protect vehicles from IEDs and  recognized a need to purchase rolled homogenous armor (RHA), a type  of armor that proved effective against both the ballistic and IED threat  after testing many armor types.  3.  DOD disagreed with our statement that a lack of coordination between  the Marine Corps and Army on addressing truck armor requirements  and solutions caused the Marine Corps to make decisions about the  types of armor to use without having all the information that was  available on protective capabilities of various armor types. We  acknowledge that the Marine Corps made attempts to coordinate  through various informal processes, such as the Armor Kit Working  Group Integrated Process Team. However, evidence showed that a  lack of a synchronized approach among the services was due to each  service having separate and distinct processes that generated the  requirements to armor vehicles. The individual requirements processes  led to the Marine Corps validating a requirement to armor vehicles 2  months after the Army validated a similar requirement to armor its  vehicles.", "Ultimately, the Marine Corps began seeking RHA armor in February  2004\u20143 months after the Army began producing armor kits made out  of RHA armor. Marine Corps officials told us that they began seeking  RHA armor from industry earlier\u2014in January 2004\u2014but were told it  was in short supply. However, Marine Corps officials have not  provided documentary evidence to substantiate this claim. For  example, in DOD\u2019s comments to this report, it stated that the first  purchase order for 3/8-inch RHA was on January 12, 2004. However,  when we subsequently requested to see the purchase order, the Marine  Corps noted that it was actually an Army purchase order. According to  the Marine Corps, they made a phone inquiry to a steel vendor in  January 2004, but have not provided documentation to support this  assertion. In addition, we spoke with other steel suppliers about the  availability of RHA during the January and March 2004 time frame.  These industry officials told us that despite lead times for RHA that  ranged from 30 days to 4 months, they could have made RHA available  to the Marine Corps quicker if the Marine Corps had approached them  directly. Moreover, although we agree that formal processes are in  place for the Marine Corps to test armor types through the Army\u2019s  Testing Center (ATC), the Marine Corps coordination with the Army to  install RHA armor kits on vehicles did not occur until the Marine  Corps\u2019 second phase of armoring. Furthermore, while the Marine  Corps cited the Army-Marine Corps Board (AMCB) and the Joint IED  Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) as other examples of Army and Marine  Corps coordination in the development of armor solutions, these  additional avenues for communication were not sufficient to bring the  services\u2019 two truck armor programs together in a synchronized  approach to ensure that requirements were identified and solutions  developed for both services at the same time. We further clarified this  position in the report.  4.  DOD disagreed with our statement that the Marine Corps did not  identify a requirement for 3/8-inch RHA until April 2004. It stated that  the need for RHA armor was identified earlier but was in short supply  from industry. While some Marine Corps officials told us that the  Marine Corps was not seeking 3/8-inch RHA for its interim armor,  other Marine Corps officials subsequently told us they became aware  of the need for 3/8-inch RHA in December 2003 and first inquired about  the availability of RHA steel with industry in January 2004. However,  these officials have not provided adequate documentation to support  the assertion or that RHA was not available from industry (see note (3)  above). Further, a Marine Corps Logistics Command report on its  armoring efforts indicated that the Marine Corps did not make the  decision to use 3/8-inch RHA until March 2004. However, it was not  until April 2004 that the Marine Corps officially identified a need for  3/8-inch RHA when it validated the requirement for the second armor  phase. Due to the conflicting information, it remains unclear exactly  when the Marine Corps became aware of the need for RHA.   5.  DOD disagreed with our statement that no formal process was in place  to ensure interservice coordination. DOD acknowledged that there was  no standing joint activity that addressed specific servicewide vehicle  hardening requirements at the time, and cited participation in and  coordination with the AKWG IPT, ATC, AMCB and JIEDDO as  instrumental in developing the Marine Corps\u2019 truck armor solutions.  While we agree that these organizations may have provided valuable  information to the Marine Corps, as stated previously, this  coordination was not sufficient to bring the services together to  identify requirements and develop solutions for both services at the  same time.  6.  DOD disagreed with our statement that troops were placed at greater  risk as a result of the time required to replace the interim armor with  add-on RHA armor and integrated armor. It noted that to accelerate  the replacement of interim armor by taking a larger amount of vehicles  out of service would create inherent risk to the operational  commanders. We did not intend to suggest that the Marine Corps  should have made this decision or that it could have done anything  different given the operational conditions in the theater. Rather, we  were simply stating that because of the time needed to replace the  interim armor with the second generation RHA armor coupled with  mission requirements, the vehicles were operating with less than the  preferred armor solution.  7.
