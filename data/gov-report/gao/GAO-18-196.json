Under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), as amended, governors are required to provide assurances that the states have laws or programs that include policies and procedures to address the needs of infants affected by prenatal substance use. This is to include health care providers notifying CPS of substance-affected infants. In response to GAO's survey, 42 states reported having policies and procedures that require health care providers to notify CPS about substance-affected infants and 8 states reported having policies that encourage notification. The remaining 1 state has a policy requiring health care providers to assess the needs of mothers and infants and if they conclude that infants are at risk for abuse or neglect, CPS is notified.", "In response to GAO's survey, 49 states reported that their CPS agency has policies to develop a plan of safe care; 2 reported not having such a requirement. Under CAPTA, states are required to develop a plan of safe care for substance-affected infants. Although not defined in law, a plan of safe care generally entails an assessment of the family's situation and a plan for connecting families to appropriate services to stabilize the family and ensure the child's safety and well-being. States reported that plans typically address the infant's safety needs, immediate medical needs, and the caregiver's substance use treatment needs. However, officials in the 3 states GAO visited noted challenges, including uncertainty about what to include in plans and the level of intervention needed for infants at low risk of abuse or neglect.", "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has provided technical assistance and guidance to states to implement these CAPTA requirements. Most states reported in GAO's survey that additional guidance and assistance would be very or extremely helpful for addressing their challenges. Nevertheless, HHS officials told GAO that the agency does not anticipate issuing additional written guidance, but that states can access technical assistance through their regional offices and the National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare\u2014a resource center funded by HHS. However, of the 37 states that reported on the helpfulness of the assistance they have received, 19 said it was only moderately helpful to not helpful. States offered suggestions for improving the assistance, such as developing substance abuse training materials for staff and holding video conferences with other states to share information. In October 2017, HHS officials explained that some states have submitted plans that include details on how they are addressing the CAPTA requirements. HHS officials reported that some of the plans submitted to date indicated that states are not meeting the requirements and those states have been asked to develop program improvement plans. Without more specific guidance and assistance to enhance states' understanding of CAPTA requirements and better address known challenges such as the ones described in this report, states may miss an opportunity to provide more effective protections and services for the children and families most in need."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that HHS provide additional guidance and technical assistance to states to address known challenges and enhance their understanding of requirements.

Infants born to women who misuse drugs or alcohol during  their pregnancy are particularly vulnerable. Many infants are born affected  by substance exposure and experience withdrawal symptoms, referred to  as substance-affected infants. A subset of these infants who were  exposed to opioids in utero may be diagnosed with neonatal abstinence  syndrome (NAS), a condition characterized by a range of symptoms,  including excessive crying, irritability, and difficulties with breathing and  feeding.

In the pretests and  expert reviews, we were generally interested in the clarity of the questions  and the flow and layout of the survey. For example, we wanted to ensure  that terms used in the survey were clear and known to the respondents,  categories provided in closed-ended questions were complete and  exclusive, and the ordering of survey sections and the questions within  each section were appropriate. The web instrument was revised based on  the pretests and expert reviews. We reviewed state officials\u2019 responses  and conducted follow-up, as necessary, to determine that their responses  were complete, reasonable, and sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  this report.

These states were selected based on  their high rates of drug mortalities in 2014 and NAS in 2012, the most  recent and comprehensive publicly available data at the time of our  analysis; recommendations from subject matter experts; and for variation in state CPS administrative frameworks (two state-administered or one  county-administered). We also visited two localities in each state,  selected based on their high rates of drug mortalities and counties with a  high incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) or infants born  drug exposed.

Mandatory reporters often  include social workers; teachers, principals, and other school personnel;  physicians, nurses, and other health care workers; and counselors,  therapists, and other mental health professionals. The circumstances  under which a mandatory reporter must make a report vary from state to  state, according to HHS. Typically, a report must be made when the  reporter, in his or her official capacity, suspects or has reason to believe  that a child has been abused or neglected.

Typically, when  CPS agencies receive a notification about suspected child abuse,  including a substance-affected infant, social workers review the referral to  determine if it should be accepted for investigation. During an  investigation, social workers determine, among other things, the nature,  extent, and cause of abuse or neglect, and identify the person  responsible for the maltreatment. An investigation may include the  following: a visit to the hospital and/or infant\u2019s home; observation of the  infant; risk and safety assessments; evaluation of the home environment;  background checks, including criminal record checks of adults that reside  with the family; as well as mental health evaluations.", "If social workers determine that there is enough evidence to suggest that  an infant is at risk for harm or neglect, or that abuse or neglect occurred,  the case is substantiated. Once a case is substantiated, CPS develops a  case plan with the family outlining objectives and tasks for the family.  Among other things, CPS may refer the family to services in the  community, such as early intervention services, parenting classes, and  substance abuse treatment. Generally, CPS attempts to strengthen the  family and alleviate the problems which led to maltreatment.

Some states reported that they explicitly require health  care providers to notify CPS of substance-affected infants. For example,  Wisconsin reported that under its state law if tests indicate that infants  have controlled substances or controlled substance analogs in their bodily  fluids, the health care provider shall report the occurrence of that  condition to CPS.  Others reported that the requirement is met by their  states\u2019 mandated reporter law\u2014whereby people in certain positions,  including health care providers, are required to notify CPS about  substance-affected infants, similar to the manner in which other  mandatory reporters, like school teachers, day care personnel, and social  workers are required to report other instances of child abuse and neglect.  For example, Kentucky statute requires that \u201cany person who knows or  has reasonable cause to believe that a child is dependent, neglected, or  abused shall immediately\u201d make a report to the police or CPS.

For example, in  Massachusetts health care providers are required to notify CPS orally  and, in writing within 48 hours, about substance-affected infants  physically dependent on drugs, even if the drugs were legally obtained  and the mother is under the care of a prescribing medical professional.  Sixteen of the 42 states reported that health care providers are required  to notify CPS of infants affected only by the illegal use of opioids, and five  of the 42 states reported that they did not know if health care providers  were required to notify CPS of infants affected by the illegal and legal use  of opioids.", "The other eight states reported that although they did not have policies  and procedures that require health care providers to notify CPS about  substance-affected infants, they have laws or policies that encourage  notification.

The state\u2019s law requires all hospital personnel who suspect  abuse and neglect or observe conditions that are likely to result in  abuse or neglect to notify CPS.", "One state reported that all persons, including health care providers,  are required to report child abuse and neglect, but reporting depends  on whether a hospital\u2019s policy indicates substance abuse is child  abuse or neglect. Further, the state CPS director reported  collaboration with the health care community on reporting substance  exposed infants to its child abuse hotline.", "Although one state reported in our survey that it does not require or  encourage health care providers to notify CPS about substance-affected  infants, in an interview, state officials explained that its policy requires that  health care providers notify CPS if, through an assessment, they  conclude that infants are at risk for abuse and neglect. Under the state\u2019s  law, health care providers in each county are required to assess the  needs of mothers and substance-affected infants using a protocol  established by county health departments, CPS agencies, and hospitals.

Three states  reported that they offer mandatory reporter training to inform health care  providers that they are obligated to notify CPS about substance-affected  infants. Another state reported that its Department of Human Services  developed a guide for mandated reporters that discusses what needs to  be reported and where to make reports. Also, one state reported that it  sent a formal letter to its state hospital association about how to report  substance-affected infants to CPS.

All of the hospitals that we visited have  policies consistent with their state\u2019s law that require that health care  providers, primarily hospital social workers, to notify CPS about  substance-affected infants. However, one state reported that some  medical personnel have been reluctant to report some infants that are  positive for illegal and legal substances due to fears of mothers being  arrested. Another state reported that stakeholders are concerned that  having to notify CPS about substance-affected infants will have a chilling  effect on the willingness of pregnant women who use substances to be  honest with providers and seek the help and support they need and  deserve. According to one state, there is often an inherent resistance to  contacting CPS in these cases as health care providers tend to view child  welfare involvement as punitive rather than a potential resource for the  family.", "In addition, three states reported in written responses to our survey  challenges understanding how to define terms, such as substance- affected, under CAPTA. For example, the Pennsylvania CPS director  expressed concerns during our site visit, suggesting that CAPTA raises  many unanswered questions, such as (1) if \u201caffected by substances\u201d  means at-risk of being or physically affected by substances, (2) what  policies relating to substance-affected infants should look like and  include, and (3) whether \u201caffected by substances\u201d should include women  who are under the care of health care or treatment providers and taking  their medications as prescribed. A Kentucky public health official told us  that a drug test, or whether the infant is affected by legal or illegal  substances, should not be the sole factor in determining CPS\u2019  involvement with a family. Rather, a holistic view of the family, whether  the substance prohibits the mother\u2019s ability to care for her child, and any  risk factors present that places the infant at risk should also be  considered.

For  these states, drug exposure does not by itself indicate that an infant\u2019s  safety is at risk. For example, one state explained that in determining  a child\u2019s safety risk, staff evaluate a number of factors including the  history of the family; the family\u2019s presentation at the birthing hospital  (appearance of chaotic behavior, suspected intoxication of adults, lack  of appropriate concern or bonding with the infant); the presentation of  the infant\u2019s physical condition; the results of any testing of parent or  child (blood, urine, etc.); discrepancies identified in the parent\u2019s  representation of their substance use or substance use treatment; and  any other concerns noted by the reporting source.", "Other states reported that their criteria for accepting notifications for  investigation are based on the degree or type of drug exposure in  question. For example, one state reported that its policy directs CPS  agencies to accept notifications for investigation when a parent has  used illegal substances or non-medical use of prescribed medication  during the last trimester of pregnancy. Another state reported that it  will accept notifications for investigation if the infant is born with a  positive toxicology or is experiencing drug withdrawal, or if the mother  tests positive for substances.", "A few states reported using both risk to the safety of infants as well as  degree or type of drug as their criteria for accepting notifications.

For example, in  Massachusetts, CPS can \u201cscreen out\u201d referrals of mothers if the only  substance affecting the infants was used by the mothers as prescribed by  their physician. In these instances, when CPS in Massachusetts is  notified by the hospital about an infant, the screener gathers information  from the caller and consults with a supervisor to determine whether the  referral should be accepted for investigation or screened out. If the  mother is on methadone, for example, but is involved with services and is  in a treatment plan, CPS verifies with medical or other qualified providers  that the mother used the drug as part of substance abuse or medical  treatment as authorized. Additionally, CPS confirms that there are no  other concerns of child abuse and/or neglect.

For example, one local CPS office that we  visited told us that social workers assess risk to and safety of infants, their  function (development, age appropriate behavior, etc.), and environment.  In addition, workers assess the caregiver\u2019s ability to parent and  employment status, as well as housing.

For  example, Massachusetts state CPS officials told us that plans of safe  care are developed for each family based on the information that staff  collect from the safety, risk, and family assessments, as well as  information collected from individuals who may have knowledge that  would inform the family assessments, such as medical and treatment  providers, and family members. Kentucky state CPS officials told us that  the local organizations and service providers that they collaborate with to  develop the plan of safe care also vary based on the family\u2019s needs. For  example, Kentucky will only collaborate with substance use treatment  providers to develop the plan of safe care when families have substance  use disorders.", "Similarly, during our site visits, officials from two states told us that the  decision to place an infant in foster care is based on the individualized  needs of the infant and caregiver. For example, Massachusetts state  officials told us that their decision to remove a baby from the home  depends on a myriad of factors and is determined on a case-by-case  basis. Officials explained that if a mother is discharged from the hospital  and begins using drugs again and does not have adequate supports in  place to care for her baby, CPS may decide to place the infant in foster  care. However, if a mother has existing support systems in place to  mitigate safety risks, CPS may decide to keep the baby in the home.", "In our survey, all 51 states reported that their agencies either always or  sometimes refer parents or caregivers to substance use treatment  programs, and most states reported that they always or sometimes refer  parents or caregivers to parenting classes or programs (49), and other  supportive services (49). CPS officials in each of the three states that  we visited told us that their plans of safe care include referrals to address  not only the immediate needs of the infants, but also the needs of the  parent or caregiver. For example, officials from a local Kentucky CPS  agency told us that staff refer mothers of substance-exposed infants to a  program called Sobriety Treatment and Recovery Team (START).  START is comprised of a social worker and a peer support mentor who  has at least 3 years of sobriety, previous involvement with CPS, and was  successfully able to regain or keep custody of her own children.  According to officials, the START program has been able to provide  participants with quick access to substance use disorder treatment.", "Officials from a Massachusetts local CPS agency told us that one of the  services that they provide to parents of substance-affected infants is a  parent aide who can help monitor how the parent is caring for the infant,  such as administering the infant\u2019s medications appropriately and ensuring  the parent is not abusing the infant\u2019s drugs. In addition, a parent aide can  provide emotional support and help parents adjust after the infant is  discharged from the hospital.

Similarly, hospitals reported  being impacted by this challenge. For example, staff at four hospitals we  visited told us that they have delayed discharging infants from the hospital  because CPS social workers did not identify caregivers to whom infants  may be released or make plans for infants in a timely manner. In addition,  staff from three hospitals told us that some CPS workers are difficult to  contact and not especially responsive to their questions. One hospital  social worker told us that she is concerned that the changes to CAPTA  that require notifying CPS of all substance-affected newborns will  inundate the agencies with cases.", "Officials from two of the three states we visited anticipated that providing  services to infants affected by the legal use of prescribed medications,  but not likely to be at risk for child abuse and neglect, will result in an  increase in the number of families referred to CPS. This, in turn, will  require a plan of safe care and further strain limited resources. Twenty- five states reported in our survey that the plan they develop for  substance-affected infants is the same as for other children in CPS care,  suggesting that states devote the same level of resources to these infants  as other cases.", "The states we visited interpret CAPTA to require that plans of safe care  be developed for all substance-affected infants who are referred to CPS,  including those who may not meet usual criteria to be accepted for an  investigation. Some state officials we interviewed questioned whether the  new CAPTA requirements would allow for the best use of limited  resources. For example, one senior state CPS official questioned whether  it would be a good use of resources to develop plans of safe care for  mothers in substance use disorder treatment or mothers using opioid  medications due to chronic pain. A local CPS official we interviewed  stated that drug exposure, in and of itself, is not necessarily a safety risk,  and CPS should not intervene with families who are not at risk for child  abuse or neglect. Instead, hospitals or treatment providers should  intervene and refer families who do not meet criteria for CPS involvement,  but could benefit from additional supports, to voluntary services. Kentucky  public health officials told us that the period after a woman gives birth is a  critical time for families as mothers may be stressed, sleep-deprived,  exhausted, and may have other children in the home. This period may be  especially challenging for mothers with substance use disorders, if  adequate supports are not in place. According to officials women are  typically covered for substance use treatment during pregnancy; however,  this coverage ends roughly 60 days after the baby is born.", "In written responses to our survey, some states reported that they would  rely on other agencies to develop plans of safe care. Similarly, in order to  manage limited CPS resources, officials from two of the three states that  we visited said they are considering having hospitals or other agencies  assume responsibility for developing plans of safe care when there is no  evidence of abuse or neglect and there appears to be minimal risk to the  safety and well-being of the infant. Kentucky officials told us that they  envision that CPS will be responsible for developing a plan of safe care  for notifications that are accepted for investigation, while hospitals, or  another agency, will be responsible for developing plans of safe care for  referrals that are screened out by CPS. According to CPS state officials,  the plan of safe care for the infant and the family can be part of the  discharge plan prior to the family leaving the hospital. However, officials  reported that obtaining cooperation from other agencies may be difficult.  Some state officials reported being concerned that other agencies may  not feel obligated to develop these plans, in part, because CAPTA  provides funding to child welfare, and other agencies may therefore  believe that child welfare should be responsible for developing the plan of  safe care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Determining What to Include in the Plan of Safe Care", "paragraphs": ["CPS officials we interviewed in two of our site visit states, as well as one  state we followed up with, told us that they were unsure of whether their  current plans will meet new CAPTA requirements because CAPTA does  not define a plan of safe care. For example, Massachusetts officials said  that their plans include everything that a family might need to ensure the  safety of the child, including resources to ensure stabilization and  reunification of a family, but they are not sure whether the plans meet  new CAPTA requirements, in part because they are not familiar with the  term \u201cplan of safe care.\u201d An official in another state was also unsure about  whether his state\u2019s \u201csafety plans\u201d would meet CAPTA requirements.  According to the official, safety plans may include a treatment plan for  mothers, and referral services, such as early intervention for the child. In  practice, plans of safe care generally address gaps that place an infant at  risk for harm or neglect. However, state officials we interviewed reported  being unsure about what a plan of safe care should look like for families  where these gaps do not exist. Also, in a written response to our survey,  one state expressed uncertainty about CPS\u2019 role if required to work with  infants who do not typically receive CPS services. For example, a  Pennsylvania official said that it is unclear what types of interventions  child welfare should conduct with families of infants exposed to legal  substances, such as medications prescribed by doctors, when the  caregivers are taking their medications correctly.", "Similarly, officials also questioned whether a plan would be necessary,  and what the plan would entail, for caregivers who are already addressing  their substance use disorder and taking steps to ensure their infant\u2019s  safety. Officials from a local Kentucky CPS office described a case in  which a mother was participating in medication-assisted treatment, had  attended counseling three times per week throughout her pregnancy, and  was continuing treatment in the postpartum period.

However,  federal law restricts the disclosure and use of alcohol and drug patient  records maintained in connection with the performance of any federal- assisted alcohol and drug abuse program. Generally, confidential  information may be disclosed in accordance with the prior written consent  of the patient. State and local CPS staff we interviewed said that strict  confidentiality requirements make it challenging for drug and alcohol  treatment providers to share information about mothers and infants. A  CPS state director from Pennsylvania said that treatment providers are  often reluctant to provide CPS case workers with information or updates  on a mother\u2019s treatment, which prevents child welfare workers from fully  understanding how mothers are progressing with their treatment and the  extent to which those in treatment are adhering to prescribed directions  as outlined by treatment providers.", "In addition, one official from a state we visited said state statutes  regarding sharing of drug and alcohol treatment information may be more  restrictive than the federal statute. Some states have developed ways to  obtain confidential information about mothers in substance use disorder  treatment. For example, officials from one local CPS office told us that in  instances when they have to develop a long-term plan of safe care for  families, they have mothers sign a release of information form in order to  obtain updates about her treatment adherence from the medication- assisted treatment provider.
