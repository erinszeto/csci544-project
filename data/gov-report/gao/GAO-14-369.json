Agencies do not routinely track the cost of completing NEPA analyses, and there is no governmentwide mechanism to do so, according to officials from CEQ, EPA, and other agencies GAO reviewed. However, the Department of Energy (DOE) tracks limited cost data associated with NEPA analyses. DOE officials told GAO that they track the money the agency pays to contractors to conduct NEPA analyses. According to DOE data, its median EIS contractor cost for calendar years 2003 through 2012 was $1.4 million. For context, a 2003 task force report to CEQ\u2014the only available source of governmentwide cost estimates\u2014estimated that a typical EIS cost from $250,000 to $2 million. EAs and CEs generally cost less than EISs, according to CEQ and federal agencies. Information on the benefits of completing NEPA analyses is largely qualitative. According to studies and agency officials, some of the qualitative benefits of NEPA include its role in encouraging public participation and in discovering and addressing project design problems that could be more costly in the long run.

Under NEPA, all  federal agencies generally are to evaluate the potential environmental  effects of actions they propose to carry out, fund, or approve (e.g., by  permit)\u2014including the development of infrastructure projects, such as  roads and bridges. Enacted in 1970, NEPA, and the subsequent Council  on Environmental Quality Regulations Implementing the Procedural  Provisions of NEPA, set out an environmental review process that has  two principal purposes: (1) to ensure that an agency carefully considers  information concerning the potential environmental effects of proposed  development projects and (2) to ensure that this information is made  available to the public. NEPA requires federal agencies to analyze the  nature and extent of a project\u2019s potential environmental effects and, in  many cases, document these analyses. The documentation and  comprehensiveness of these analyses depends on the significance of a  project\u2019s potential effects on the environment.

We selected the  Departments of Defense, Energy, the Interior, and Transportation; and  the Forest Service within the U.S. Department of Agriculture for analysis  because they generally complete the most NEPA analyses. Our findings  for these agencies are not generalizeable to other federal agencies but  provide examples of NEPA implementation. To describe the frequency  and outcome of NEPA litigation, we reviewed (1) laws, regulations, and  agency guidance; (2) NEPA litigation data collected from federal entities  and the National Association of Environmental Professionals (NAEP), the  professional association for NEPA practitioners within and outside the  federal government; and (3) relevant studies.

Agencies may prepare an EA to determine whether a proposed project is  expected to have a potentially significant impact on the human  environment. If prior to or during the development of an EA, the agency  determines that the project may cause significant environmental impacts,  an EIS should be prepared. However, if the agency, in its EA, determines  there are no significant impacts from the proposed project or action, then  it is to prepare a document\u2014a Finding of No Significant Impact\u2014that  presents the reasons why the agency has concluded that no significant  environmental impacts will occur if the project is implemented. An EIS is a  more detailed statement than an EA, and NEPA implementing regulations  specify requirements and procedures\u2014such as providing the public with  an opportunity to comment on the draft document\u2014applicable to the EIS  process that are not mandated for EAs.", "If a proposed project fits within a category of activities that an agency has  already determined normally does not have the potential for significant  environmental impacts\u2014a CE\u2014and the agency has established that  category of activities in its NEPA implementing procedures, then it  generally need not prepare an EA or EIS. The agency may instead approve projects that fit within the relevant category by using one of its  established CEs. For example, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM)  within the Department of the Interior (Interior) has CEs in place for  numerous types of activities, such as constructing nesting platforms for  wild birds and constructing snow fences for safety. For a project to be  approved using a CE, the agency must determine whether any  extraordinary circumstances exist in which a normally excluded action  may have a significant effect. Figure 1 illustrates the general process for  implementing NEPA requirements.", "Private individuals or companies may become involved in the NEPA  process when a project they are developing needs a permit or other  authorization from a federal agency to proceed, such as when the project  involves federal land. For example, a company may apply for such a  permit in constructing a pipeline crossing federal lands; in that case, the  agency that is being asked to issue the permit must evaluate the potential  environmental effects of constructing the pipeline under NEPA. The  private company or developer may in some cases provide environmental  analyses and documentation or enter into an agreement with an agency  to pay a contractor for the preparation of environmental analyses and  documents, but the agency remains ultimately responsible for the scope  and content of the analyses under NEPA.", "CEQ within the Executive Office of the President oversees the  implementation of NEPA, reviews and approves federal agency NEPA  procedures, and issues regulations and guidance documents that govern    and guide federal agencies\u2019 interpretation and implementation of NEPA. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also plays two key roles in  other agencies\u2019 NEPA processes. First, EPA reviews and publicly  comments on the adequacy of each draft EIS and the environmental  impacts of the proposed actions reviewed in the EIS. If EPA determines  that the action is environmentally unsatisfactory, it is required by law to  refer the matter to CEQ. Second, EPA maintains a national EIS filing  system. Federal entities must publish in the Federal Register a Notice of  Intent to prepare an EIS and file their draft and final EISs with EPA, which  publishes weekly notices in the Federal Register listing EISs available for  public review and comment.", "CEQ\u2019s regulations implementing NEPA require federal agencies to solicit  public comment on draft EISs. When the public comment period is  finished, the agency proposing to carry out or permitting a project is to  analyze comments, conduct further analysis as necessary, and prepare  the final EIS. In the final EIS, the agency is to respond to the substantive  comments received from other government agencies and the public.  Sometimes a federal agency must prepare a supplemental analysis to  either a draft or final EIS if it makes substantial changes in the proposed  action that are relevant to environmental concerns, or if there are  significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental  concerns.

More specifically, 189 cases were filed in  1974, according to the twenty-fifth anniversary report of CEQ. In 1994,  106 NEPA lawsuits were filed. Since that time, according to CEQ data,  the number of NEPA lawsuits filed annually has consistently been just  above or below 100, with the exception of a period in the early- and mid- 2000s. In 2011, the most recent data available, CEQ reported 94 NEPA  cases, down from the average of 129 cases filed per year from 2001  through 2008. In 2012, U.S. Courts of Appeals issued 28 decisions  involving implementation of NEPA by federal agencies, according to  NAEP data.", "Although the number of NEPA lawsuits is relatively small when compared  with the total number of NEPA analyses, one lawsuit can affect numerous  federal decisions or actions in several states, having a far-reaching  impact. In addition to CEQ regulations and an agency\u2019s own regulations,  according to a 2011 CRS report, preparers of NEPA analyses and  documentation may be mindful of previous judicial interpretation in an  attempt to prepare a \u201clitigation-proof\u201d EIS.an effort may lead to an increase in the cost and time needed to complete  NEPA analyses but not necessarily to an improvement in the quality of  the documents ultimately produced."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Federal Government Prevails in Most NEPA Litigation", "paragraphs": ["The federal government prevails in most NEPA litigation, according to  CEQ and NAEP data and other legal studies.

In general, according to CEQ data, NEPA case outcomes are  about evenly split between those involving challenges to EISs and those  involving other challenges to the adequacy of NEPA analyses (e.g., EAs  and CEs). The federal government successfully defended its decisions in  more than 50 percent of the cases from 2008 through 2011. For example,  in 2011, 99 of the 146 total NEPA case dispositions\u201468 percent\u2014 reported by CEQ resulted in a judgment favorable to the federal agency  being sued or a dismissal of the case without settlement. In 2011, that  rate increased to 80 percent if the 18 settlements reported by CEQ were  considered successes. However, the CEQ data do not present enough  case-specific details to determine whether the settlements should be  considered as favorable dispositions. The plaintiffs, in most cases, were  public interest groups.", "Reporting litigation outcome data similar to CEQ\u2019s, a January 2014 article  on Forest Service land management litigation found that the Forest  Service won nearly 54 percent of its cases and lost about 23 percent.  About 23 percent of the cases were settled, which the study found to be  an important dispute resolution tool. Litigants generally challenged  logging projects, most frequently under the National Environmental Policy  Act and the National Forest Management Act. The article found that the  Forest Service had a lower success rate in cases where plaintiffs  advocated for less resource use (generally initiated by environmental  groups) compared to cases where greater resource use was advocated.  The report noted that environmental groups suing the Forest Service for  less resource use not only have more potential statutory bases for legal  challenges available to them than groups seeking more use of national  forest resources, but there are also more statutes that relate directly to  enhancing public participation and protecting natural resources.", "Other sources of information also show that the federal government  prevails in most NEPA litigation. For example, NAEP\u2019s 2012 annual  NEPA report stated that the government prevailed in 24 of the 28 cases  (86 percent) decided by U.S. Courts of Appeals. A NEPA legal treatise  similarly reports that \u201cgovernment agencies almost always win their case  when the adequacy of an EIS is challenged, if the environmental analysis  is reasonably complete. Adequacy cases raise primarily factual issues on  which the courts normally defer to the agency. The success record in  litigation is more evenly divided when a NEPA case raises threshold  questions that determine whether the agency has complied with the  statute. An example is a challenge to an agency decision that an EIS was  not required.

To generate  information on the number of Environmental Impact Statements from  EPA\u2019s database, we sorted the data by calendar year and counted the  number of analyses for each year. We did not conduct an extensive  evaluation of this database, although a high-level analysis discovered  potential inconsistencies. For example, EPA\u2019s database contained entries  with the same unique identifier, making it difficult to identify the exact  number of NEPA analyses. We discussed these inconsistencies with EPA  officials, who told us that they were aware of certain errors due to manual  data entry and the use of different analysis methods.

Federal agencies decide how to apply CEQ regulations in  the NEPA process. According to a 2007 Congressional Research Service  (CRS) report, the CEQ regulations were meant to be generic in nature,  with individual agencies formulating procedures applicable to their own  projects. The report states that this approach was taken because of the  diverse nature of projects and environmental impacts managed by federal  agencies with unique mandates and missions. Consequently, NEPA  procedures vary to some extent from agency to agency, and  comprehensive governmentwide data on NEPA analyses are generally  not centrally collected.", "As stated by a CEQ official, \u201cthere is no master NEPA spreadsheet, and  there are many gaps in NEPA-related data collected across the federal  government.\u201d To obtain information on agency NEPA activities, the official  said that CEQ works closely with its federal agency NEPA contact group,  composed of key officials responsible for implementing NEPA in each  agency. CEQ meets regularly with these officials and uses this network to  collect NEPA-related information through requests for information,  whereby CEQ distributes a list of questions to relevant agencies and then  collects and reports the answers. According to CEQ officials, NEPA data  reported by CEQ are generated through these requests, which have  quality assurance limitations because related activities at federal  departments are themselves diffused throughout various offices and  bureaus.", "Of the agencies we reviewed, the Departments of Defense, the Interior,  and Transportation do not centrally collect information on NEPA analyses,  allowing component agencies to collect the information, whereas the  Department of Energy and the Forest Service within the Department of  Agriculture aggregate certain data.", "Department of Defense (DOD). Each of the military services and defense  agencies collects data on NEPA analyses, but DOD does not aggregate  information that is collected on the number and type of NEPA analyses at  the departmentwide level. Data collection within the military services and  agencies is decentralized, according to DOD officials. For example, the  Army collects Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) data at the  Armywide level, and responsibility for Environmental Assessments (EA)  and Categorical Exclusions (CE) are delegated to the lowest possible  command level. DOD officials said that each of the services and defense  agencies works to maintain a balance between the work that needs to be  completed and the management effort needed to accomplish that work.  While the level of information collected may vary by service or defense  agency, each collects the information that it has determined necessary to  manage its NEPA workload. According to these officials, every new  information system and data call must generally come from existing  funding, taking resources from other tasks.", "Department of the Interior (Interior). Data are not collected at the  department level, according to Interior officials, and Interior conducts its  own departmentwide data calls to component bureaus and entities  whenever CEQ asks for NEPA-related information. The data collection  efforts of its individual bureaus vary considerably. For example, the  National Park Service uses its Planning, Environment, and Public  Comment (PEPC) system as a comprehensive information and public  comment site for National Park Service projects. Other Interior bureaus  are beginning to track information or rely on less formal systems and not  formalized databases. For example, the Bureau of Indian Affairs uses its  internal NEPA Tracker system\u2014started in September 2012\u2014which the  bureau states is to collect information on NEPA analyses to create a  better administrative record to potentially identify new categories of CEs  for future development and use. Prior to the NEPA Tracker system, the  Bureau of Indian Affairs tracked NEPA analyses less formally, with  varying information quality across the bureau\u2019s different entities,  according to agency officials.

The tool is fully operational, and the  bureau expects to complete implementation in 2015. At the Bureau of  Reclamation, NEPA activities are cataloged and tracked by each region  or area office according to local procedures, and the information on the  number and type of NEPA analyses resides with these offices.

Environmental  reviews for highway projects funded by FHWA have long been of interest  to Congress and federal, state, and local stakeholders. FHWA and its 52  division offices have traditionally used an internal data system to track  EIS documents. FHWA officials told us that they are in the process of  replacing the agency\u2019s legacy system with the new Project and Program  Action Information (PAPAI) system, which went online in March 2013.

The Council also recognizes that some  projects will entail difficult long-term planning and/or the acquisition of certain data which  of necessity will require more time for the preparation of the EIS. Indeed, some proposals  should be given more time for the thoughtful preparation of an EIS and development of a  decision which fulfills NEPA\u2019s substantive goals.
