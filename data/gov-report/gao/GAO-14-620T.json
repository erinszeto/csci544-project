For example, for 4 of the 10 physical therapy consults GAO reviewed for one VA medical center (VAMC), between 108 and 152 days elapsed with no apparent actions taken to schedule an appointment for the veteran. For 1 of these consults, several months passed before the veteran was referred for care to a non-VA health care facility. VAMC officials cited increased demand for services, and patient no-shows and cancelled appointments among the factors that lead to delays and hinder their ability to meet VHA's guideline of completing consults within 90 days of being requested. GAO's preliminary work also identified variation in how the five VAMCs reviewed have implemented key aspects of VHA's business rules, such as strategies for managing future care consults\u2014requests for specialty care appointments that are not clinically needed for more than 90 days. Such variation may limit the usefulness of VHA's data in monitoring and overseeing consults systemwide. Furthermore, oversight of the implementation of the business rules has been limited and has not included independent verification of VAMC actions. Because of the preliminary nature of this work, GAO is not making recommendations on VHA's consult process at this time.", "In its December 2012 report, GAO found that VHA's outpatient medical appointment wait times were unreliable. The reliability of reported wait time performance measures was dependent in part on the consistency with which schedulers recorded desired date\u2014defined as the date on which the patient or health care provider wants the patient to be seen\u2014in the scheduling system. However, VHA's scheduling policy and training documents were unclear and did not ensure consistent use of the desired date. GAO also found that inconsistent implementation of VHA's scheduling policy may have resulted in increased wait times or delays in scheduling timely medical appointments. For example, GAO identified clinics that did not use the electronic wait list to track new patients in need of medical appointments as required by VHA policy, putting these patients at risk for not receiving timely care. VA concurred with the four recommendations included in the report and, in April 2014, reported continued actions to address them. For example, in response to GAO's recommendation for VA to take actions to improve the reliability of its medical appointment wait time measures, officials stated the department has implemented new patient wait time measures that no longer rely on desired date recorded by a scheduler. VHA officials stated that the department also is continuing to address GAO's three additional recommendations. Although VA has initiated actions to address GAO's recommendations, continued work is needed to ensure these actions are fully implemented in a timely fashion. Ultimately, VHA's ability to ensure and accurately monitor access to timely medical appointments is critical to ensuring quality health care to veterans, who may have medical conditions that worsen if access is delayed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today as you examine issues related to  challenges the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) faces in providing  health care to our nation\u2019s veterans. In recent years, VA\u2019s Veterans  Health Administration (VHA) has faced a growing demand for providing  outpatient medical appointments. From fiscal years 2005 through 2012,  the number of annual outpatient medical appointments VHA provided  increased by approximately 45 percent, from 58 million to 84 million.  VHA provided this care through its primary and specialty care clinics,  which are managed by VA medical centers (VAMC). Although access to  timely medical appointments is critical to ensuring that veterans obtain  needed medical care, problems with VHA\u2019s scheduling and management  of outpatient medical appointments may contribute to delays in care, or  care not being provided at all. Over the past few years there have been  numerous reports of VAMCs failing to provide timely care to patients,  including specialty care, and in some cases, the delays have resulted in  harm to patients. Nonetheless, VHA has reported continued  improvements in achieving timely patient access to medical  appointments. For example, in fiscal year 2011, VA reported that VHA  completed 89 percent of medical appointments for new patients within its  goal; in fiscal year 2012, VA reported that VHA completed 90 percent of  primary and specialty care new patient appointments within the goal.  However, in December 2012, we reported that VHA\u2019s medical  appointment wait times were unreliable and VHA\u2019s inadequate oversight  of the outpatient medical appointment scheduling processes contributed  to VHA\u2019s problems with scheduling timely medical appointments.", "When a physician or other provider determines that a veteran needs  outpatient specialty care, the provider refers the veteran to a specialist for  a clinical consult\u2014a request for evaluation or management of a patient for  a specific clinical concern, or for a specialty procedure such as a  colonoscopy.

We also visited 23 high-volume  outpatient clinics at four VAMCs selected for variation in size, complexity,  and location; these four VAMCs were located in Dayton, Ohio; Fort  Harrison, Montana; Los Angeles, California; and Washington, D.C. At  each VAMC we interviewed leadership and other officials about how they  manage and improve medical appointment timeliness, their oversight to  ensure accuracy of scheduling data and compliance with scheduling  policy, and problems staff experience in scheduling timely medical  appointments. We examined each VAMC\u2019s and clinic\u2019s implementation of  elements of VHA\u2019s scheduling policy and obtained documentation of  scheduler training completion. In addition, we interviewed schedulers  from 19 of the 23 clinics visited, and also reviewed patient complaints  about telephone responsiveness, which is integral to timely medical  appointment scheduling.

Clinical consults include requests by physicians or other  providers for both clinical consultations and procedures. A clinical  consultation is a request seeking an opinion, advice, or expertise  regarding evaluation or management of a patient\u2019s specific clinical  concern, whereas a procedure is a request for a specialty procedure such  as a colonoscopy. Clinical consults are typically requested by a veteran\u2019s  primary care provider using VHA\u2019s electronic consult system. Once a  provider sends a request, VHA requires specialty care providers to review  it within 7 days and determine whether to accept the consult. If the  specialty care provider accepts the consult\u2014determines the consult is  needed and is appropriate\u2014an appointment is made for the patient to  receive the consultation or procedure. In some cases, a provider may  discontinue a consult for several reasons, including that the care is not  needed, the patient refuses care, or the patient is deceased. In other  cases the specialty care provider may determine that additional  information is needed, and will send the consult back to the requesting  provider, who can resubmit the consult with the needed information. Once  the appointment is held, VHA\u2019s policy requires the specialty care provider  to appropriately document the results of the consult, which would then  close out the consult as completed in the electronic system. VHA\u2019s  current guideline is that consults should be completed within 90 days of  the request.they were unable to complete the consult.", "If an appointment is not held, staff are to document why  In 2012, VHA created a database to capture all consults systemwide and,  after reviewing these data, determined that the data were inadequate for  monitoring consults. One issue identified was the lack of standard  processes and uses of the electronic consult system across VHA. For  example, in addition to requesting consults for clinical concerns, the  system was also being used to request and manage a variety of  administrative tasks, such as requesting patient travel to appointments.  Additionally, VHA could not accurately determine whether patients  actually received the care they needed or if they received the care in a  timely fashion. According to VHA officials, approximately 2 million  consults (both clinical and administrative consults) were unresolved for  more than 90 days. Subsequently, VA\u2019s Under Secretary for Health  convened a task force to address these and other issues regarding VHA\u2019s  consult system, among other things. In response to task force  recommendations, in May 2013, VHA launched the Consult Management  Business Rules Initiative to standardize aspects of the consult process,  with the goal of developing consistent and reliable information on consults  across all VAMCs. This initiative requires VAMCs to complete four  specific tasks between July 1, 2013, and May 1, 2014:", "Review and properly assign codes to consistently record consult  requests in the consult system;", "Assign distinct identifiers in the electronic consult system to  differentiate between clinical and administrative consults;", "Develop and implement strategies for requesting and managing  requests for consults that are not needed within 90 days\u2014known as  \u201cfuture care\u201d consults; and", "Conduct a clinical review as warranted, and as appropriate, close all  unresolved consults\u2014those open more than 90 days.", "At the time of our December 2012 review, VHA measured outpatient  medical appointment wait times as the number of days elapsed from the  patient\u2019s or provider\u2019s desired date, as recorded in the VistA scheduling  system by VAMCs\u2019 schedulers. In fiscal year 2012, VHA had a goal of  completing new and established patient specialty care appointments  within 14 days of the desired date. VHA established this goal based on its  performance reported in previous years. To facilitate accountability for  achieving its wait time goals, VHA includes wait time measures\u2014referred  to as performance measures\u2014in its VISN directors\u2019 and VAMC directors\u2019  performance contracts, and VA includes measures in its budget  submissions and performance reports to Congress and stakeholders.  The performance measures, like wait time goals, have changed over  time.", "Officials at VHA\u2019s central office, VISNs, and VAMCs all have oversight  responsibilities for the implementation of VHA\u2019s scheduling policy. For  example, each VAMC director, or designee, is responsible for ensuring  that clinics\u2019 scheduling of medical appointments complies with VHA\u2019s  scheduling policy and for ensuring that any staff who can schedule  medical appointments in the VistA scheduling system have completed the  required VHA scheduler training.

Specifically, several  VAMC officials discussed a growing demand for both gastroenterology  procedures, such as colonoscopies, as well as consultations for physical  therapy evaluations. Additionally, officials noted that due to difficulty in  hiring and retaining specialists for these two clinical areas, they have  developed periodic backlogs in providing services. Officials at these  facilities indicated that they try to mitigate backlogs by referring veterans  for care with non-VA providers. However, this strategy does not always  prevent delays in veterans receiving timely care. For example, officials  from two VAMCs told us that non-VA providers are not always available.  Examples of consults that were not completed in 90 days include:", "For 3 of 10 gastroenterology consults we reviewed for one VAMC, we  found that between 140 and 210 days elapsed from the dates the  consults were requested to when the patient received care. For the  consult that took 210 days, an appointment was not available and the  patient was placed on a waiting list before having a screening  colonoscopy.", "For 4 of the 10 physical therapy consults we reviewed for one VAMC,  we found that between 108 and 152 days elapsed, with no apparent  actions taken to schedule an appointment for the veteran. The  patients\u2019 files indicated that due to resource constraints, the clinic was  not accepting consults for non-service-connected physical therapy  evaluations. In 1 of these cases, several months passed before the  veteran was referred to non-VA care, and he was seen 252 days after  the initial consult request. In the other 3 cases, the physical therapy  clinic sent the consults back to the requesting provider, and the  veterans did not receive care for that consult.", "For all 10 of the cardiology consults we reviewed for one VAMC, we  found that staff initially scheduled patients for appointments between  33 and 90 days after the request, but medical files indicated that  patients either cancelled or did not show for their initial appointments.  In several instances patients cancelled multiple times. In 4 of the  cases VAMC staff closed the consults without the patients being seen;  in the other 6 cases VAMC staff rescheduled the appointments for  times that exceeded the 90-day timeframe.", "As we also reported, our preliminary work identified variation in how the  five VAMCs we reviewed have implemented key aspects of VHA\u2019s  business rules, which limits the usefulness of the data in monitoring and  overseeing consults systemwide. As previously noted, VHA\u2019s business  rules were designed to standardize aspects of the consult process, thus  creating consistency in VAMCs\u2019 management of consults. However,  VAMCs have reported variation in how they are implementing certain  tasks required by the business rules. For example, VAMCs have  developed different strategies for managing future care consults\u2014 requests for specialty care appointments that are not clinically needed for  more than 90 days.", "At one VAMC, officials reported that specialty care providers have  been instructed to discontinue consults for appointments that are not  needed within 90 days and requesting providers are to track these  consults outside of the electronic consult system and resubmit them  closer to the date the appointment is needed. These consults would  not appear in VHA\u2019s systemwide data once they have been  discontinued.", "At another VAMC, officials stated that appointments for specialty care  consults are scheduled regardless of whether the appointments are  needed beyond 90 days. These future care consults would appear in  VHA consult data and would eventually appear on a timeliness report  as consults open greater than 90 days. Officials from this VAMC  stated that they continually have to explain to VISN officials who  monitor the VAMC\u2019s consult timeliness that these open consults do  not necessarily mean that care has been delayed.", "Officials from another VAMC reported piloting a strategy in its  gastroenterology clinic where future care consults are entered in an  electronic system separate from the consult and appointment  scheduling systems. Approximately 30 to 60 days before the care is  needed the requesting provider is notified to enter the consult request  in the electronic consult system for the specialty care provider to  complete.", "In addition, oversight of the implementation of VHA\u2019s business rules has  been limited and has not included independent verification of VAMC  actions. VAMCs were required to self-certify completion of each of the  four tasks outlined in the business rules. VISNs were not required to  independently verify that VAMCs appropriately completed the tasks.  Without independent verification, VHA cannot be assured that VAMCs  implemented the tasks correctly.", "Furthermore, VHA did not require that VAMCs document how they  addressed unresolved consults that were open greater than 90 days, and  none of the five VAMCs in our review were able to provide us with  specific documentation in this regard. VHA officials estimated that as of  April 2014, about 450,000 of the approximately 2 million consults (both  clinical and administrative consults) remained unresolved systemwide.  VAMC officials noted several reasons that consults were either completed  or discontinued in this process of addressing unresolved consults,  including improper recording of consult notes, patient cancellations, and  patient deaths. At one of the VAMCs we reviewed, a specialty care clinic  discontinued 18 consults the same day that a task for addressing  unresolved consults was due. Three of these 18 consults were part of our  random sample, and our review found no indication that a clinical review  was conducted prior to the consults being discontinued. Ultimately, the  lack of independent verification and documentation of how VAMCs  addressed these unresolved consults may have resulted in VHA consult  data that inaccurately reflected whether patients received the care  needed or received it in a timely manner.", "Although VHA\u2019s business rules were intended to create consistency in  VAMCs\u2019 consult data, our preliminary work identified variation in  managing key aspects of consult management that are not addressed by  the business rules. For example, there are no detailed systemwide VHA  policies on how to handle patient no-shows and cancelled appointments,  particularly when patients repeatedly miss appointments, which may  make VAMCs\u2019 consult data difficult to assess. For example, if a patient  cancels multiple specialty care appointments, the associated consult  would remain open and could inappropriately suggest delays in care. To  manage this type of situation, one VAMC developed a local consult policy  referred to as the \u201c1-1-30\u201d rule. The rule states that a patient must receive  at least 1 letter and 1 phone call, and be granted 30 days to contact the  VAMC to schedule a specialty care appointment. If the patient fails to do  so within this time frame, the specialty care provider may discontinue the  consult. According to VAMC officials, several of the consults we reviewed  would have been discontinued before reaching the 90-day threshold if the  1-1-30 rule had been in place at the time. Three VAMCs included in our  review also noted some type of policy addressing patient no-shows and  cancelled appointments, each of which varied in its requirements.  Without a standard policy across VHA addressing patient no-shows and  cancelled appointments, VHA consult data may reflect numerous  variations of how VAMCs handle patient no-shows and cancelled  appointments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reliability of Reported Outpatient Medical Appointment Wait Times and Scheduling Oversight Need Improvement, and VA Has Initiated Actions to Address Related GAO Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["In December 2012, we reported that VHA\u2019s reported outpatient medical  appointment wait times were unreliable and that inconsistent  implementation of VHA\u2019s scheduling policy may have resulted in  increased wait times or delays in scheduling timely outpatient medical  appointments. Specifically, we found that VHA\u2019s reported wait times were  unreliable because of problems with recording the appointment desired  date in the scheduling system. Since, at the time of our review, VHA  measured medical appointment wait times as the number of days elapsed  from the desired date, the reliability of reported wait time performance  was dependent on the consistency with which VAMC schedulers  recorded the desired date in the VistA scheduling system.

Furthermore, VAMCs\u2019 oversight of  compliance with VHA\u2019s scheduling policy, such as ensuring the  completion of required scheduler training, was inconsistent across  facilities. VAMCs also described other problems with scheduling timely  medical appointments, including VHA\u2019s outdated and inefficient  scheduling system, gaps in scheduler and provider staffing, and issues  with telephone access. For example, officials at all VAMCs we visited  reported that high call volumes and a lack of staff dedicated to answering  the telephones affected their ability to schedule timely medical  appointments.", "VA concurred with the four recommendations included in our December  2012 report and reported continuing actions to address them.", "First, we recommended that the Secretary of VA direct the Under  Secretary for Health to take actions to improve the reliability of its  outpatient medical appointment wait time measures. In response,  VHA officials stated that they implemented more reliable measures of  patient wait times for primary and specialty care. In fiscal years 2013  and 2014, primary and specialty care appointments for new patients  have been measured using time stamps from the VistA scheduling  system to report the time elapsed between the date the appointment  was created\u2014instead of the desired date\u2014and the date the  appointment was completed. VHA officials stated that they made the  change from using desired date to creation date based on a study that  showed a significant association between new patient wait times  using the date the appointment was created and self-reported patient  satisfaction with the timeliness of VHA appointments. VA, in its FY  2013 Performance and Accountability Report, reported that VHA  completed 40 percent of new patient specialty care appointments  within 14 days of the date the appointment was created in fiscal year  2013; in contrast, VHA completed 90 percent of new patient specialty  care appointments within 14 days of the desired date in fiscal year  2012. VHA also modified its measurement of wait times for  established patients, keeping the appointment desired date as the  starting point, and using the date of the pending scheduled  appointment, instead of the date of the completed appointment, as the  end date for both primary and specialty care. VHA officials stated that  they decided to use the pending appointment date instead of the  completed appointment date because the pending appointment date  does not include the time accrued by patient no-shows and cancelled  appointments.", "Second, we recommended that the Secretary of VA direct the Under  Secretary for Health to take actions to ensure VAMCs consistently  implement VHA\u2019s scheduling policy and ensure that all staff complete  required training. In response, VHA officials stated that the  department is in the process of revising the VHA scheduling policy to  include changes, such as the new methodology for measuring wait  times, and improvements and standardization of the use of the  electronic wait list. In the interim, VHA distributed guidance, via  memo, to VAMCs in March 2013 describing this information and also  offered webinars to VHA staff on eight dates in April and May of 2013.  To assist VISNs and VAMCs in the task of verifying that all staff have  completed required scheduler training, VHA has developed a  database that will allow a VAMC to identify all staff who have  scheduled appointments and the volume of appointments scheduled  by each; VAMC staff can then compare this information to the list of  staff that have completed the required training. However, VHA officials  have not established a target date for when this database would be  made available for use by VAMCs.", "Third, we recommended that the Secretary of VA direct the Under  Secretary for Health to take actions to require VAMCs to routinely  assess scheduling needs for purposes of allocation of staffing  resources. VHA officials stated that they are continuing to work on  identifying the best methodology to carry out this recommendation,  but stated that the database that tracks the volume of appointments  scheduled by individual staff also may prove to be a viable tool to  assess staffing needs and the allocation of resources. VHA officials  stated that they needed to discuss further how VAMCs could use this  tool, and that they had not established a targeted completion date for  actions to address this recommendation.", "Finally, we recommended that the Secretary of VA direct the Under  Secretary for Health to take actions to ensure that VAMCs provide  oversight of telephone access, and implement best practices to  improve telephone access for clinical care. In response, VHA required  each VISN director to require VAMCs to assess their current  telephone service against the VHA telephone improvement guide and  to electronically post an improvement plan with quarterly updates.  VAMCs are required to routinely update progress on the improvement  plan. VHA officials cited improvement in telephone response and call  abandonment rates since VAMCs were required to implement  improvement plans. Additionally, VHA officials said that the  department has also contracted with an outside vendor to assess  VHA\u2019s telephone infrastructure and business process. In April 2014,  VHA officials stated that they expected to receive the first report in  approximately 2 months.", "Although VA has initiated actions to address our recommendations, we  believe that continued work is needed to ensure these actions are fully  implemented in a timely fashion. Furthermore, it is important that VA  assess the extent to which these actions are achieving improvements in  medical appointment wait times and scheduling oversight as intended.  Ultimately, VHA\u2019s ability to ensure and accurately monitor access to  timely medical appointments is critical to ensuring quality health care to  veterans, who may have medical conditions that worsen if access is  delayed.", "Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Burr, and Members of the  Committee, this concludes my statement.
