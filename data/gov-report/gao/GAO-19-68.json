The report noted that the respective locations of both radar systems affect their ability to provide those capabilities. The Department of Defense (DOD) also has other radar investments\u2014the Pacific Radar and the Space Fence, which, according to DOD officials, may reduce DOD's reliance on Cobra Dane to provide ballistic missile defense and space surveillance capabilities.", "The Air Force's report to Congress noted that Cobra Dane met its requirement for operational availability, which refers to the percentage of time that the radar is able to meet its missions. GAO found that the Air Force has developed procedures to mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available. For example, U.S. Northern Command and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) officials stated that they can mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available by using the Sea-Based X-band radar to provide support for ballistic missile defense. The Air Force would face some limitations in its ability to conduct space surveillance if Cobra Dane were not available, as Cobra Dane tracks objects no other radar can track. However, MDA officials noted there are no plans to take Cobra Dane offline long enough to compromise space surveillance.", "The Air Force and MDA plan to contribute total funding of $278.6 million for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane, according to their fiscal year 2019 budget plans. Specifically, the Air Force and MDA plan to share funding for the operation and maintenance of the Cobra Dane radar and for three modernization projects that make up their sustainment plan for the radar. Further, the Air Force report noted that the Air Force also plans to provide $140 million in funding for the sustainment and maintenance of operational access to Cobra Dane's site at Shemya Island. In addition, GAO found that the Air Force developed a total cost estimate for one project\u2014known as the transmitter group replacement\u2014but not for its other two projects.

The Air Force fielded Cobra Dane in 1976 on Shemya Island,  Alaska. In subsequent years, Cobra Dane has undergone upgrades and  changes to its mission. From 1977 to 1994, the Air Force used Cobra  Dane to support a primary mission of intelligence gathering, and to  provide early warning of missile threats and conduct space surveillance  (tracking objects in space) as additional missions. In 1994, the Air Force  stopped using Cobra Dane to support missile warning. The Air Force also  ceased using Cobra Dane for space surveillance for 5 years, but  continued to operate the radar in a limited capacity to support intelligence  gathering. In 2004, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) completed  upgrades to Cobra Dane so that it could contribute to a new ballistic  missile defense mission. Since MDA completed the upgrades, the Air  Force has used Cobra Dane to support ballistic missile defense and  space surveillance missions. In anticipating future needs, DOD began  investing in new radar systems that will provide varying mission  capabilities. However, DOD does not intend for any one of these systems  to be a complete replacement for Cobra Dane. Radar investments include  the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) at Clear Air Force Station  in Alaska; the Space Fence at Kwajalein Atoll, Marshall Islands; and the  Pacific Radar.

Specifically, the  conference report accompanying a bill for the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (\u201cthe Act\u201d) included a provision that  the Air Force, in coordination with MDA and U.S. Northern Command,  submit a report on the Cobra Dane radar to the congressional defense  committees with its fiscal year 2019 budget request. The report was to  outline the capabilities of Cobra Dane and alternative radars, DOD\u2019s plan  for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane, and the costs to  sustain Cobra Dane and its site at Shemya Island. The Air Force  submitted the report in January 2018.", "The conference report accompanying the Act also included a provision  that we review the Air Force\u2019s report to Congress. This report identifies  information included in the Air Force\u2019s report and describes additional  information that we reviewed on (1) the capabilities of the Cobra Dane  radar and other planned radars to meet DOD\u2019s mission requirements, (2)  Cobra Dane\u2019s operational availability and the plan to mitigate the effect on  those missions when Cobra Dane is not operationally available, and (3)  DOD\u2019s funding plan and project cost estimates related to the operation  and sustainment of Cobra Dane and its site at Shemya Island.", "For all objectives, we reviewed the Air Force report to Congress and  identified information related to requirements outlined in the conference  report. We interviewed officials from Headquarters Air Force, Air Force  Space Command, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, MDA,  U.S. Northern Command, and U.S. Strategic Command to discuss  information contained within the Air Force report, and to identity other  information and documentation relevant to each of our three objectives.", "For objective one, we also reviewed documentation that outlined the  capabilities of Cobra Dane and other radar investments. Our review  included MDA\u2019s reports on the LRDR and its analysis of alternatives on  ballistic missile defense sensors. We also reviewed a U.S. Strategic  Command briefing for information on the capabilities of Cobra Dane and  alternative radar systems. We did not independently review the quality of  the technical materials or the process by which MDA or U.S. Strategic  Command assessed the capabilities of Cobra Dane or other radar  systems because doing so was beyond the scope of our review to  describe additional information on the capabilities of Cobra Dane and  other radar investments.", "For objective two, we also reviewed documentation related to the  operational availability of Cobra Dane and the associated effects if Cobra  Dane is not available, including Air Force data on the operational  availability and space surveillance performance of Cobra Dane. We  asked cognizant Air Force officials questions about the reliability of their  operational availability data and reviewed relevant documentation on how  they calculate that data. We determined that we could use these data for  the limited purpose of describing the reported operational availability of  Cobra Dane compared to its requirement. We also reviewed U.S.  Northern Command\u2019s analysis on the abilities of various radar systems to  track missile threats targeting U.S. locations.", "For objective three, we also reviewed documentation related to DOD\u2019s  plans to fund the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane and to  identify project cost estimates.

DOD uses Cobra Dane  and other radar systems to provide information over a short period of time  to ground-based interceptors so they can hit their targets. Such radar  systems contribute to ballistic missile defense by tracking incoming  missile threats, classifying the missile threat, and determining if a threat  was intercepted successfully. In addition, some radar systems can  provide discrimination capabilities, which allow for that radar to identify a  warhead when a missile threat deploys decoys at the same time. Radar  systems can also have the capability to contribute to a space surveillance  mission, which provides an awareness of space objects within or near the  Earth\u2019s orbit and their movements, capabilities, and intent. Finally, radars  can also contribute intelligence-gathering capabilities. Each radar  system\u2019s ability to contribute to various missions can be dependent on  that radar\u2019s inherent capabilities and physical location.", "See table 1 for a description of selected radar systems that can provide  some or all of these capabilities.", "Various offices within the Air Force, in coordination with MDA, are  responsible for the operation and sustainment of the Cobra Dane radar.

U.S. Northern Command  oversees the homeland ballistic missile defense mission, and establishes  operational objectives for radar systems operating in its region. U.S.  Northern Command officials told us that they are the end user for Cobra  Dane.

However, the report incorrectly stated that both  radar systems have the inherent capability to determine if a missile threat  is successfully intercepted. MDA documentation that we reviewed shows  that Cobra Dane does not yet have this capability. When we shared our  finding with Air Force and MDA officials, they agreed that this reported  capability was incorrectly identified in the Air Force report to Congress.  MDA officials also told us that Cobra Dane could provide this capability in  the future if it implements software changes, but they are unlikely to do  this until calendar year 2025.", "The Air Force report also noted that LRDR would have a unique  capability, once it is operational, to discriminate missile threats from any  deployed decoys. See table 2 for a summary of what the Air Force  reported for the ballistic missile defense capabilities of Cobra Dane and  LRDR.", "In addition to identifying ballistic missile defense capabilities of each  radar, the Air Force report noted that both Cobra Dane and LRDR will  have the inherent capabilities to support space surveillance and  intelligence-gathering missions. DOD officials we spoke to confirmed that  they have plans to use those inherent capabilities to support these other  missions. For example, U.S. Strategic Command identified that DOD  needs Cobra Dane to support its space surveillance mission. Further, Air  Force and MDA officials told us that they use Cobra Dane to track small  objects that no other radar system can track. MDA officials told us that  LRDR could be used for space surveillance. However, Air Force and U.S.  Strategic Command officials stated that there are no plans to use LRDR\u2019s  space surveillance capabilities as a replacement for Cobra Dane.  Additionally, Air Force officials told us that neither Cobra Dane nor LRDR  is required to support an intelligence-gathering mission.", "The Air Force also included information in its report on how the locations  of Cobra Dane and LRDR affect their abilities to contribute to the ballistic  missile defense mission. For example, the Air Force reported that Cobra  Dane\u2019s location at Shemya Island, Alaska, allows it to track missile  threats from North Korea earlier in their trajectories than LRDR would be  able to track at Clear Air Force Station, Alaska. This is consistent with an  MDA analysis that we reviewed that outlined additional advantages  provided by Cobra Dane\u2019s location at Shemya Island. According to that  analysis, Cobra Dane can begin tracking missile threats approximately  210 seconds earlier than LRDR. Air Force officials told us that the  additional time to track missile threats allows the warfighter an earlier  opportunity to intercept a missile threat and deploy additional interceptors  if the first attempt fails. Further, the MDA analysis described a tracking  gap between the areas covered by LRDR\u2014once it is operational at Clear  Air Force Station\u2014and the two sets of AN/TPY-2 radars that are currently  located in Japan. Without Cobra Dane\u2019s coverage of this gap, the  analysis found that the warfighter would have a more limited opportunity  to intercept a missile threat from North Korea. Figure 2 shows how Cobra  Dane covers a gap between the LRDR (once operational) and the two  AN/TPY-2 radars in Japan.", "The Air Force report also noted that LRDR\u2019s geographic location has its  own advantages in contributing to ballistic missile defense compared to  Cobra Dane\u2019s location. For example, the Air Force report noted that  LRDR\u2019s location would allow it to track missile threats later in their  trajectories beyond Cobra Dane\u2019s coverage as those threats make their  way to the continental United States. We also found that MDA has  determined LRDR will have other advantages due to its location. For  example, an MDA analysis that we reviewed found that LRDR\u2019s location  will allow for the radar system to contribute to ballistic missile defense  from North Korean and Iranian threats. Absent LRDR, this analysis  determined that there are no other radar systems that are located in a  position to provide the capability to discriminate missile threats and  determine if a threat was successfully intercepted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Determination of LRDR Location", "paragraphs": ["In addition to what the Air Force reported, we found that DOD decided to  locate LRDR at Clear Air Force Station in Alaska after considering the  advantages and disadvantages of other locations. For example, MDA  completed studies that examined how LRDR could perform at various  locations in Alaska, and the cost-effectiveness of constructing and  sustaining the radar at those sites. In a June 2015 analysis, MDA  compared how LRDR could perform in discriminating missile threats  when co-locating it with Cobra Dane at Shemya Island or placing it at  Clear Air Force Station. MDA determined that LRDR could provide more  real-time discrimination information for missile threats targeting Alaska  and the continental United States if it constructed the radar at Clear Air  Force Station versus Shemya Island. Additionally, MDA identified in an  October 2016 study that the department could obtain operational  advantages and cost savings by constructing LRDR at Clear Air Force  Station, Alaska, when compared to constructing it at Shemya Island,  Alaska. Specifically, MDA determined that Clear Air Force Station could  provide better results for 11 of the 13 factors it reviewed compared to  Shemya Island.

MDA began developing the Pacific Radar to provide additional missile  threat tracking and discrimination capabilities. According to U.S.  Northern Command and MDA officials, the Pacific Radar may fill the  gap in tracking missile threats currently covered by Cobra Dane.", "Space Fence: The Air Force has also determined it will no longer  have a requirement for Cobra Dane to provide space surveillance  once the Space Fence is fully operational. The Air Force plans for the  Space Fence to be operational in fiscal year 2019. According to a  U.S. Strategic Command briefing, the Space Fence will provide the  same capabilities as Cobra Dane.

Air Force officials stated that the decline in  the operational availability over the more recent two-year period was due  to a few instances where they needed to take Cobra Dane off-line for  extended periods of scheduled downtime (e.g., regular operations and  maintenance, calibration of instruments). Further, they noted that when  Cobra Dane is not operationally available, the reason is usually due to  scheduled downtime.", "Officials also told us there was one instance of unscheduled downtime  (e.g., part or system failure) in that 2-year period which required  emergency maintenance on the radar\u2019s mission control hardware. We  also reviewed Air Force data on the frequency of unscheduled downtime  between August 2016 and July 2018, which show that Cobra Dane is able  to contribute to its missions without unscheduled downtime 99.7 percent  of the time.", "According to U.S. Northern Command and MDA officials, they can  mitigate the effect on the ballistic missile defense mission if they know far  enough in advance that Cobra Dane will not be operationally available\u2014 such as during scheduled downtime. Officials stated that they do this by  moving a transportable radar, known as the Sea-Based X-band radar, to  specific locations in the Pacific Ocean to provide additional tracking  coverage of missile threats. A U.S. Northern Command analysis that we  reviewed describes how DOD can deploy the Sea-Based X-band radar at  particular locations in the Pacific Ocean to supplement Cobra Dane.  This analysis found that U.S. Northern Command can lose the ability to  track some missile threat trajectories if Cobra Dane is not available and  the Sea-Based X-band radar is not deployed.", "We also reviewed Air Force data on space surveillance, which shows that  the Air Force would face some limitations in its ability to complete its  space surveillance mission when Cobra Dane is not operationally  available. According to the data, Cobra Dane tracks 3,300 space objects  each day that cannot be tracked by any other radar system. Air Force  officials noted that when Cobra Dane is not operationally available for  space surveillance for short periods (less than 24 hours), they can  overcome that downtime without losing track of those unique objects.  However, officials told us that it would take six months to reacquire all of  the small space objects that Cobra Dane tracks, if they encounter any  significant scheduled or unscheduled downtime.
