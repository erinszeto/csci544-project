In this report, GAO examines (1) the extent to which State and USAID partners experienced banking access challenges, (2) USAID partners' reporting on such challenges, and (3) actions U.S. agencies have taken to help address such challenges. GAO selected four high-risk countries\u2014Syria, Somalia, Haiti, and Kenya\u2014based on factors such as their inclusion in multiple financial risk-related indices, and selected a non-generalizable sample of 18 projects in those countries.

Moreover, the majority of partners (15 out of 18) for the 18 projects noted experiencing banking access challenges on their global portfolio of projects over the previous 5 years.", "USAID's partners' written reports do not capture potential risks posed by banking access challenges because USAID generally does not require most partners to report in writing any challenges that do not affect implementation. Six of the 7 projects that encountered challenges were USAID-funded. Of those 6 USAID projects, 5 partners told us that these challenges did not rise to the threshold of affecting project implementation that would necessitate reporting, and 1 did not report challenges although its project was adversely affected. Additionally, GAO's review of about 1,300 USAID partner reports found that the few instances where challenges were mentioned lacked sufficient detail for GAO to determine their type, severity, or origin. Without information on banking access challenges that pose potential risks to project implementation, USAID is not aware of the full extent of risks to achieving its objectives.", "The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and State have taken various actions to help address banking access challenges encountered by nonprofit organizations (NPO), but USAID's efforts have been limited. Treasury's efforts have focused on engagement between NPOs and U.S. agencies, while State has issued guidance on the topic to its embassies and designated an office to focus on these issues. In contrast, USAID lacks a comparable office, and NPOs stated that it is difficult to find USAID staff to engage with on this topic. Further, GAO found that awareness of specific challenges was generally limited to USAID staff directly overseeing the project. Without communicating these challenges to relevant parties, USAID may not be aware of all risks to agency objectives and may not be able to effectively engage with external entities on efforts to address these challenges."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that USAID should take steps to (1) collect information on banking access challenges experienced by USAID's partners and (2) communicate that information both within USAID and with external entities, such as other U.S. agencies and partners.

Partners including  nonprofit organizations (NPO) implement much of this assistance in areas  experiencing conflict, instability, or other issues that increase the risk of  financial crimes.", "The World Bank and others have expressed concerns that derisking and  decreased banking access make it more difficult for NPOs to transfer  funds to areas that are perceived as high-risk, in part because of  concerns about possible terrorist abuse or money laundering risks. For  example, a recent survey by the Charity and Security Network (CSN), a  trade association for NPOs, found that two-thirds of U.S.-based NPOs  with international operations experienced banking access challenges,  including delays in transferring funds, increased fees, and account  closures. As a result, there have been concerns that NPOs, including  State and USAID implementing partners (partners), may face long delays  in transferring funds or be unable to transfer funds at all to implement  projects or respond to humanitarian disasters, such as those in Syria,  Somalia, and elsewhere. In addition, NPOs may be forced to move  money through less transparent, less traceable, and riskier channels.  Further, a large group of NPOs, banks, and others gathered at a World  Bank meeting on derisking stated that the inability to get humanitarian  assistance to refugees from political conflicts or natural disasters could  result in death from starvation, exposure, and disease.", "This is one of four GAO reports addressing a congressional request to  review the various effects of derisking, including on the delivery of  humanitarian assistance.

We did not ask the partners to quantify the number of projects  they had implemented over the previous 5 years, nor did we ask them to  quantify the number of projects in their global portfolio for which they had  experienced banking access challenges. To determine our sample, we  selected 18 projects from our selected countries (7 projects in Syria, 5 in  Somalia, 3 in Haiti, and 3 in Kenya). We selected more projects in Syria  and Somalia because those countries had received a greater proportion  of the U.S. humanitarian assistance. We selected our projects to ensure  that we included 18 unique partners (15 NPOs and 3 United Nations  organizations), as well as a mix of State and USAID projects (3 State and  15 USAID).

Three of the partners are United Nations organizations. The  implementing partners in our sample had fiscal year 2016 annual  revenues ranging from $5.9 billion to just over $10 million. We conducted  semi-structured interviews with each of the 18 implementing partners on  potential banking access challenges, such as the ability to open and  maintain new accounts and make transfers in a timely fashion, and the  effect of those challenges on project implementation. Our interviews were  separated into two distinct sets of questions\u2014one on banking access  challenges the implementing partner encountered on the selected project,  and the other on any banking access challenges the implementing  partner encountered in its global portfolio of humanitarian assistance  projects over the previous 5 years (2013-2017).", "When discussing their global humanitarian assistance portfolios, the  partners did not limit their responses to projects funded by U.S.  government agencies, but instead considered projects funded by all of  their donors. We did not ask the partners to quantify the number of  projects they had implemented over the previous 5 years, nor did we ask  them to quantify the number of projects in their global portfolio of  humanitarian assistance for which they had experienced banking access  challenges. Our interview followed a protocol that asked both closed and  open-ended questions. For most banking access challenges, when  interview respondents indicated that their project or organization had  experienced a banking access challenge, we probed for details of the  challenge, including whether the challenge had caused an adverse effect  on the project, such as project delays or cancellations. After the  interviews had been conducted, we content-coded some of the open- ended answers we received. Specifically, we developed codes on  whether any challenges reported had adversely affected the projects, the  extent and duration of delays in transferring funds, and the extent and  frequency of denials of international fund transfers. Two analysts  independently coded each interview.

This survey received more than 300 responses, which constituted a  reported response rate of about 38 percent. The researchers conducting  the survey indicated that this response rate could be considered high for  a public opinion telephone survey but low for a survey like the Census.  The study determined the survey findings to be representative of the  population with some qualifications, such as the fact that smaller  organizations were more likely to complete the survey than larger  organizations. The maximum margin of error was estimated to be 5.4  percent. More than 70 of the NPOs reported that they had received U.S.  government funding. We requested and received some additional data  analysis from the researchers who had conducted this survey. We  examined the aggregate survey responses in detail and compared them  to the responses we received to our semi-structured interview questions,  which probed into similar aspects of financial access.

The reports included annual reports, final contractor / grantee  reports, final evaluation reports, and periodical and periodic reports (such  as quarterly or semi-annual reports).

We developed this lexicon of financial  access terms based on a review of relevant research, interviews with  industry organizations, and a manual review of USAID progress reports.  Using the lexicon, our textual analysis program identified all mentions of  identified terms in the universe of reports. Next, two analysts  independently reviewed the mentions identified through our textual  analysis software program to determine whether the mentions actually  constituted a reporting of a financial access challenge. The analysts then  reconciled any differences in their reviews. For the purposes of this  review, we considered a relevant financial access challenge to be any  challenge encountered by the implementing partner in obtaining U.S.  banking services, or in transferring funds from the United States to the  destination country. We did not conduct a similar review of State partner  reporting because we only had a sample of three State projects and one of the projects did not require direct written reporting to State. In addition,  State does not have a central depository for partner reports that we could  search, such as USAID\u2019s DEC.", "For our third objective, to examine actions relevant U.S. agencies have  taken to help address banking access challenges encountered by NPOs,  we conducted interviews with and reviewed documentation from State,  USAID, and Treasury on actions they have taken to help address these  challenges. We also discussed U.S. agency involvement in efforts to help  address these challenges with relevant organizations that represent  NPOs. In addition, we reviewed relevant documentation published by the  World Bank and the Financial Action Task Force on actions they have  taken to help address banking access challenges encountered by NPOs,  and interviewed relevant staff at the World Bank on efforts undertaken to  address banking access challenges.", "To examine the extent to which State and USAID encountered banking  access challenges in providing assistance in high-risk countries, we  interviewed State officials responsible for conducting overseas transfers  of funds for both State and USAID to determine if any banking access  challenges exist that are specific to our case study countries as well as  for U.S. assistance worldwide. We also interviewed State and USAID  officials with responsibility for overseeing programs in our four selected  countries to determine if they had seen any effects of banking access  challenges. We focused primarily on these agencies\u2019 ability to access  banking services in the United States and on the transfer of funds to the  ultimate destination.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2017 to September 2018  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
