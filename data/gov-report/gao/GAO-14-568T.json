The Dashboard also includes ratings of investments' risk on a scale from 1 (high risk) to 5 (low risk). As of April 2014, according to the Dashboard, 559 investments were low or moderately low risk (green), 159 were medium risk (yellow), and 42 were moderately high or high risk (red).", "GAO has issued a series of reports on Dashboard accuracy and, in 2011, found that while there were continued issues with the accuracy and reliability of cost and schedule data, the accuracy of these data had improved over time. Further, a recent GAO report found that selected agencies' ratings were mostly or completely consistent with investment risk. However, this report also noted that agencies had removed major investments from the IT Dashboard, representing a troubling trend toward decreased transparency and accountability. Additionally, GAO reported that as of December 2013, the public version of the Dashboard was not updated for 15 of the previous 24 months because OMB did not revise it as the President's budget request was being created. Consequently, GAO made recommendations to improve the Dashboard's accuracy, ensure that it includes all major IT investments, and increase its availability. Agencies generally agreed with the report or had no comments.", "In an effort to consolidate the growing number of federal data centers, OMB launched a consolidation initiative intended to close 40 percent of government data centers by 2015, and in doing so, save $3 billion. GAO reported that agencies planned to close 1,055 data centers by the end of fiscal year 2014, but also highlighted the need for continued oversight of these efforts. Among other things, GAO recommended that OMB improve the execution of important oversight responsibilities, with which OMB agreed.", "To better manage the government's existing IT systems, OMB launched the PortfolioStat initiative, which, among other things, requires agencies to conduct annual reviews of their IT investments and make decisions on eliminating duplication. GAO reported that agencies continued to identify duplicative spending as part of PortfolioStat and that this initiative has the potential to save at least $5.8 billion by fiscal year 2015, but that weaknesses existed in agencies' implementation of the initiative's requirements. Among other things, GAO made several recommendations to improve agencies' implementation of PortfolioStat requirements.

However, despite spending hundreds of billions on IT  since 2000, the federal government has experienced failed IT projects  and has achieved little of the productivity improvements that private  industry has realized from IT. Too often, federal IT projects run over  budget, behind schedule, or fail to deliver results. In combating this  problem, proper oversight is critical.", "Both OMB and federal agencies have key roles and responsibilities for  overseeing IT investment management and OMB is responsible for  working with agencies to ensure investments are appropriately planned  and justified. However, as we have described in numerous reports,  although a variety of best practices exist to guide their successful  acquisition, federal IT projects too frequently incur cost overruns and  schedule slippages while contributing little to mission-related outcomes.", "Agencies have reported that poor-performing projects have often used a  \u201cbig bang\u201d approach\u2014that is, projects that are broadly scoped and aim to  deliver capability several years after initiation. For example, in 2009 the  Defense Science Board reported that the Department of Defense\u2019s  (Defense) acquisition process for IT systems was too long, ineffective,  and did not accommodate the rapid evolution of IT. The board reported  that the average time to deliver an initial program capability for a major IT  system acquisition at Defense was over 7 years.", "Each year, OMB and federal agencies work together to determine how  much the government plans to spend on IT projects and how these funds  are to be allocated. As reported to OMB, federal agencies plan to spend  more than $82 billion on IT investments in fiscal year 2014, which is the  total expended for not only acquiring such investments, but also the  funding to operate and maintain them. Of the reported amount, 27 federal  agencies plan to spend about $75 billion, $17 billion on development and  acquisition and $58 billion on operations and maintenance (O&M). Figure  1 shows the percentages of total planned spending for 2014 for the $75  billion spent on development and O&M.", "However, this $75 billion does not reflect the spending of the entire  federal government. We have previously reported that OMB\u2019s figure  understates the total amount spent in IT investments. Specifically, it does  not include IT investments by 58 independent executive branch agencies,  including the Central Intelligence Agency, or by the legislative or judicial  branches. Further, agencies differed on what they considered an IT  investment; for example, some have considered research and  development systems as IT investments, while others have not. As a  result, not all IT investments are included in the federal government\u2019s  estimate of annual IT spending. OMB provided guidance to agencies on  how to report on their IT investments, but this guidance did not ensure  complete reporting or facilitate the identification of duplicative  investments. Consequently, we recommended, among other things, that  OMB improve its guidance to agencies on identifying and categorizing IT  investments.", "Further, over the past several years, we have reported that overlap and  fragmentation among government programs or activities could be  harbingers of unnecessary duplication. Thus, the reduction or elimination  of duplication, overlap, or fragmentation could potentially save billions of  tax dollars annually and help agencies provide more efficient and  effective services."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OMB Has Launched Major Initiatives for Overseeing Investments", "paragraphs": ["OMB has implemented a series of initiatives to improve the oversight of  underperforming investments, more effectively manage IT, and address  duplicative investments. These efforts include the following:  IT Dashboard.

The public dissemination of this information is  intended to allow OMB; other oversight bodies, including Congress;  and the general public to hold agencies accountable for results and  performance. Among other things, agencies are to submit Chief  Information Officer (CIO) ratings, which, according to OMB\u2019s  instructions, should reflect the level of risk facing an investment on a  scale from 1 (high risk) to 5 (low risk) relative to that investment\u2019s  ability to accomplish its goals. Ultimately, CIO ratings are assigned  colors for presentation on the Dashboard, according to the five-point  rating scale, as illustrated in table 1.", "As of April 2014, according to the IT Dashboard, 201 of the federal  government\u2019s 760 major IT investments\u2014totaling $12.4 billion\u2014were in  need of management attention (rated \u201cyellow\u201d to indicate the need for  attention or \u201cred\u201d to indicate significant concerns).

In January 2010, the Federal CIO began leading  TechStat sessions\u2014face-to-face meetings to terminate or turnaround  IT investments that are failing or are not producing results. These  meetings involve OMB and agency leadership and are intended to  increase accountability and transparency and improve performance.  Subsequently, OMB empowered agency CIOs to hold their own  TechStat sessions within their respective agencies. According to the  former Federal CIO, the efforts of OMB and federal agencies to  improve management and oversight of IT investments have resulted  in almost $4 billion in savings.", "Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative. Concerned about the  growing number of federal data centers, in February 2010 the Federal  CIO established the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative. This  initiative\u2019s four high-level goals are to promote the use of \u201cgreen IT\u201d  by reducing the overall energy and real estate footprint of government  data centers; reduce the cost of data center hardware, software, and  operations; increase the overall IT security posture of the government;  and shift IT investments to more efficient computing platforms and  technologies.

PortfolioStat is designed  to assist agencies in assessing the current maturity of their IT  investment management process, making decisions on eliminating  duplicative investments, and moving to shared solutions in order to  maximize the return on IT investments across the portfolio.

Specifically, we reported  that federal agency officials identified seven successful acquisitions, in  that they best achieved their respective cost, schedule, scope, and  performance goals.

However, we have issued a series of reports highlighting  deficiencies with the accuracy and reliability of the data reported on the  Dashboard. For example, we reported in October 2012 that Defense  had not rated any of its investments as either high or moderately high risk  and that in selected cases, these ratings did not appropriately reflect  significant cost, schedule, and performance issues reported by GAO and  others. We recommended that Defense ensure that its CIO ratings reflect  available investment performance assessments and its risk management  guidance. Defense concurred and has revised its process to address  these concerns.", "Further, while we reported in 2011 that the accuracy of Dashboard cost  and schedule data had improved over time, more recently, in December  2013 we found that agencies had removed investments from the  Dashboard by reclassifying their investments\u2014representing a troubling  trend toward decreased transparency and accountability. Specifically,  the Department of Energy reclassified several of its supercomputer  investments from IT to facilities and the Department of Commerce  decided to reclassify its satellite ground system investments. Additionally,  as of December 2013, the public version of the Dashboard was not  updated for 15 of the previous 24 months because OMB does not revise it  as the President\u2019s budget request is being created.", "We also found that, while agencies experienced several issues with  reporting the risk of their investments, such as technical problems and  delayed updates to the Dashboard, the CIO ratings were mostly or  completely consistent with investment risk at seven of the eight selected  agencies. Additionally, the agencies had already addressed several of  the discrepancies that we identified. The final agency, the Department of  Veterans Affairs, did not update 7 of its 10 selected investments because  it elected to build, rather than buy, the ability to automatically update the  Dashboard, and has now resumed updating all investments. To their  credit, agencies\u2019 continued attention to reporting the risk of their major IT  investments supports the Dashboard\u2019s goal of providing transparency and  oversight of federal IT investments.", "Nevertheless, the rating issues that we identified with performance  reporting and annual baselining, some of which are now corrected,  serve to highlight the need for agencies\u2019 continued attention to the  timeliness and accuracy of submitted information, in order to allow the  Dashboard to continue to fulfill its stated purpose. We recommended that  agencies appropriately categorize IT investments and that OMB make  Dashboard information available independent of the budget process.

Further, 4 selected agencies\u2014the Departments of Agriculture,  Commerce, HHS, and DHS\u2014conducted 37 TechStats covering 28  investments.

In addition,  several agencies had weaknesses in selected areas such as the CIO\u2019s  authority to review and approve the entire portfolio, and ensuring a  complete baseline of information relative to commodity IT. Further, we  observed that OMB\u2019s estimate of about 100 consolidation opportunities  and a potential $2.5 billion in savings from the PortfolioStat initiative was  understated because, among other things, it did not include estimates  from Defense and the Department of Justice.
