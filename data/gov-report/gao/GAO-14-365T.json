DHS has begun to work with other agencies to identify facilities that should have reported their chemical holdings to CFATS, but may not have done so. DHS initially identified about 40,000 facilities by publishing a CFATS rule requiring that facilities with certain types of chemicals report the types and quantities of these chemicals. However, a chemical explosion in West, Texas last year demonstrated the risk posed by chemicals covered by CFATS. Subsequent to this incident, the President issued Executive Order 13650 which was intended to improve chemical facility safety and security in coordination with owners and operators. Under the executive order, a federal working group is sharing information to identify additional facilities that are to be regulated under CFATS, among other things.", "Assessing risk and prioritizing facilities. DHS has begun to enhance its ability to assess risks and prioritize facilities. DHS assessed the risks of facilities that reported their chemical holdings in order to determine which ones would be required to participate in the program and subsequently develop site security plans. GAO's April 2013 report found weaknesses in multiple aspects of the risk assessment and prioritization approach and made recommendations to review and improve this process. In February 2014, DHS officials told us they had begun to take action to revise the process for assessing risk and prioritizing facilities.", "Reviewing security plans . DHS has also begun to take action to speed up its reviews of facility security plans. Per the CFATS regulation, DHS was to review security plans and visit the facilities to make sure their security measures met the risk-based performance standards. GAO's April 2013 report found a 7- to 9-year backlog for these reviews and visits, and DHS has begun to take action to expedite these activities. As a separate matter, one of the performance standards\u2014personnel surety, under which facilities are to perform background checks and ensure appropriate credentials for personnel and visitors as appropriate\u2014is being developed. As of February 2014, DHS has reviewed and conditionally approved facility plans pending final development of the personal surety performance standard.", "Inspecting to verify compliance . In February 2014, DHS reported it had begun to perform inspections at facilities to ensure compliance with their site security plans. According to DHS, these inspections are to occur about 1 year after facility site security plan approval. Given the backlog in plan approvals, this process has started recently and GAO has not yet reviewed this aspect of the program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In a July 2012 report, GAO recommended that DHS measure its performance implementing actions to improve its management of CFATS.

To conduct our prior work, we  reviewed applicable laws and regulations, as well as NPPD, IP, and ISCD  policies and procedures for administering the CFATS program and  conducting its mission. We interviewed senior ISCD officials along with  NPPD and IP officials to obtain their views on the program and how ISCD  assesses risk.

Further details on  the scope and methodology for the previously issued reports are available  within each of the published products. To update our work, we met with  senior ISCD officials and discussed status updates on the four areas  (identifying facilities, assessing risk and prioritizating facilities, reviewing  security plans, and inspecting facilities).

As a result of the CFATS rule, about  40,000 chemical facilities reported their chemical holdings and their  quantities to DHS\u2019s ISCD.", "In August 2013, we testified about the ammonium nitrate explosion at the  chemical facility in West, Texas, in the context of our past CFATS work.  Among other things, the hearing focused on whether the West, Texas,  facility should have reported its holdings to ISCD given the amount of  ammonium nitrate at the facility. During this hearing, the Director of the  CFATS program remarked that throughout the existence of CFATS, DHS  had undertaken and continued to support outreach and industry  engagement to ensure that facilities comply with their reporting  requirements. However, the Director stated that the CFATS regulated  community is large and always changing and DHS relies on facilities to  meet their reporting obligations under CFATS. At the same hearing, a  representative of the American Chemistry Council testified that the West,  Texas, facility could be considered an \u201coutlier\u201d chemical facility, that is, a  facility that stores or distributes chemical-related products, but is not part  of the established chemical industry. Preliminary findings of the CSB  investigation of the West, Texas, incident showed that although certain  federal agencies that regulate chemical facilities may have interacted with  the facility, the ammonium nitrate at the West, Texas, facility was not  covered by these programs. For example, according to the findings, the  Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) Risk Management Program,  which deals with the accidental release of hazardous substances, covers  the accidental release of ammonia, but not ammonium nitrate. As a  result, the facility\u2019s consequence analysis considered only the possibility  of an ammonia leak and not an explosion of ammonium nitrate.", "On August 1, 2013, the same day as the hearing, the President issued  Executive Order 13650\u2013Improving Chemical Facility Safety and Security,  which was intended to improve chemical facility safety and security in  coordination with owners and operators.established a Chemical Facility Safety and Security Working Group,  composed of representatives from DHS; EPA; and the Departments of  Justice, Agriculture, Labor, and Transportation, and directed the working  group to identify ways to improve coordination with state and local  partners; enhance federal agency coordination and information sharing;  modernize policies, regulations and standards; and work with  stakeholders to identify best practices. In February 2014, DHS officials  told us that the working group has taken actions in the areas described in  the executive order. For example, according to DHS officials, the working  group has held listening sessions and webinars to increase stakeholder  input, explored ways to share CFATS data with state and local partners to  increase coordination, and launched a pilot program in New York and  New Jersey aimed at increasing federal coordination and information  sharing. DHS officials also said that the working group is exploring ways   The executive order  to better share information so that federal and state agencies can identify  non-compliant chemical facilities and identify options to improve chemical  facility risk management.

ISCD uses the data submitted in facilities\u2019 Top Screens to make  an assessment as to whether facilities are covered under the program. If  DHS determines that they are covered by CFATS, facilities are to then  submit data via another online tool, called a security vulnerability  assessment, so that ISCD can further assess their risk and prioritize the  covered facilities. ISCD uses a risk assessment approach to develop  risk scores to assign chemical facilities to one of four final tiers. Facilities  placed in one of these tiers (tier 1, 2, 3, or 4) are considered to be high  risk, with tier 1 facilities considered to be the highest risk. The risk score  is intended to be derived from estimates of consequence (the adverse  effects of a successful attack), threat (the likelihood of an attack), and  vulnerability (the likelihood of a successful attack, given an attempt).  ISCD\u2019s risk assessment approach is composed of three models, each  based on a particular security issue: (1) release, (2) theft or diversion, and  (3) sabotage, depending on the type of risk associated with the 322  chemicals. Once ISCD estimates a risk score based on these models, it  assigns the facility to a final tier.", "Our prior work showed that the CFATS program was using an incomplete  risk assessment approach to assign chemical facilities to a final tier.  Specifically, in April 2013, we reported that the approach ISCD used to  assess risk and make decisions to place facilities in final tiers did not  consider all of the elements of consequence, threat, and vulnerability  associated with a terrorist attack involving certain chemicals. For  example, the risk assessment approach was based primarily on  consequences arising from human casualties, but did not consider  economic criticality consequences, as called for by the 2009 National  Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) and the CFATS regulation. In  April 2013, we reported that ISCD officials told us that, at the inception of  the CFATS program, they did not have the capability to collect or process  all of the economic data needed to calculate the associated risks and they  were not positioned to gather all of the data needed. They said that they  collected basic economic data as part of the initial screening process;  however, they would need to modify the current tool to collect more  sufficient data. We also found that the risk assessment approach did not  consider threat for approximately 90 percent of tiered facilities. Moreover,  for the facilities that were tiered using threat considerations, ISCD was  using 5-year-old data. We also found that ISCD\u2019s risk assessment  approach was not consistent with the NIPP because it did not consider  vulnerability when developing risk scores. When assessing facility risk,  ISCD\u2019s risk assessment approach treated every facility as equally  vulnerable to a terrorist attack regardless of location and on-site security.  As a result, in April 2013 we recommended that ISCD enhance its risk  assessment approach to incorporate all elements of risk and conduct a  peer review after doing so.", "ISCD agreed with our recommendations, and in February 2014, ISCD  officials told us that they were taking steps to address them and  recommendations of a recently released Homeland Security Studies and  Analysis Institute (HSSAI) report that examined the CFATS risk  assessment model.among other things, that the CFATS risk assessment model  inconsistently considers risks across different scenarios and that the  model does not adequately treat facility vulnerability. Overall, HSSAI  recommended that ISCD revise the current risk-tiering model and create  a standing advisory committee\u2014with membership drawn from  government, expert communities, and stakeholder groups\u2014to advise  DHS on significant changes to the methodology.", "As with the findings in our report, HSSAI found,  In February 2014, senior ISCD officials told us that they have developed  an implementation plan that outlines how they plan to modify the risk  assessment approach to better include all elements of risk while  incorporating our findings and recommendations and those of HSSAI.  Moreover, these officials stated that they have completed significant work  with Sandia National Laboratory with the goal of including economic  consequences into their risk tiering approach. They said that the final  results of this effort to include economic consequences will be available in  the summer of 2014. With regard to threat and vulnerability, ISCD officials  said that they have been working with multiple DHS components and  agencies, including the Transportation Security Administration and the  Coast Guard, to see how they consider threat and vulnerability in their  risk assessment models. ISCD officials said that they anticipate that the  changes to the risk tiering approach should be completed within the next  12 to 18 months.

Under the CFATS  rule, once a facility is assigned a final tier, it is to submit a site security  plan or participate in an alternative security program in lieu of a site  security plan. The security plan is to describe security measures to be  taken and how such measures are to address applicable risk-based  performance standards. After ISCD receives the site security plan, the  plan is reviewed using teams of ISCD employees (i.e., physical, cyber,  chemical, and policy specialists), contractors, and ISCD inspectors. If  ISCD finds that the requirements are satisfied, ISCD issues a letter of  authorization to the facility. After ISCD issues a letter of authorization to  the facility, ISCD is to then inspect the facility to determine if the security  measures implemented at the site comply with the facility\u2019s authorized  plan. If ISCD determines that the site security plan is in compliance with  the CFATS regulation, ISCD approves the site security plan, and issues a  letter of approval to the facility, and the facility is to implement the  approved site security plan.", "In April 2013, we reported that it could take another 7 to 9 years before  ISCD would be able to complete reviews of the approximately 3,120 plans  in its queue at that time. As a result, we estimated that the CFATS  regulatory regime, including compliance inspections (discussed in the  next section), would likely not be implemented for 8 to 10 years. We also  noted in April 2013 that ISCD had revised its process for reviewing  facilities\u2019 site security plans. ISCD officials stated that they viewed ISCD\u2019s  revised process to be an improvement because, among other things,  teams of experts reviewed parts of the plans simultaneously rather than  sequentially, as had occurred in the past. In April 2013, ISCD officials  said that they were exploring ways to expedite the process, such as  streamlining inspection requirements.", "In February 2014, ISCD officials told us that they are taking a number of  actions intended to lessen the time it takes to complete reviews of  remaining plans including the following: providing updated internal guidance to inspectors and ISCD updating the internal case management system; providing updated external guidance to facilities to help them better  prepare their site security plans;  conducting inspections using one or two inspectors at a time over the  course of 1 day, rather than multiple inspectors over the course of  several days;  conducting pre-inspection calls to the facility to help resolve technical  issues beforehand;  creating and leveraging the use of corporate inspection documents  (i.e., documents for companies that have over seven regulated  facilities in the CFATS program);  supporting the use of alternative security programs to help clear the  backlog of security plans because, according to DHS officials,  alternative security plans are easier for some facilities to prepare and  use; and  taking steps to streamline and revise some of the on-line data  collection tools such as the site security plan to make the process  faster.", "It is too soon to tell whether DHS\u2019s actions will significantly reduce the  amount of time needed to resolve the backlog of site security plans  because these actions have not yet been fully implemented.", "In April 2013, we also reported that DHS had not finalized the personnel  surety aspect of the CFATS program. The CFATS rule includes a risk- based performance standard for personnel surety, which is intended to  provide assurance that facility employees and other individuals with  access to the facility are properly vetted and cleared for access to the  facility. In implementing this provision, we reported that DHS intended to  (1) require facilities to perform background checks on and ensure  appropriate credentials for facility personnel and, as appropriate, visitors  with unescorted access to restricted areas or critical assets, and (2)  check for terrorist ties by comparing certain employee information with its  terrorist screening database. However, as of February 2014, DHS had not  finalized its information collection request that defines how the personal  surety aspect of the performance standards will be implemented. Thus,  DHS is currently approving facility security plans conditionally whereby  plans are not to be finally approved until the personnel surety aspect of  the program is finalized. According to ISCD officials, once the personal  surety performance standard is finalized, they plan to reexamine each  conditionally approved plan. They would then make final approval as long  as ISCD had assurance that the facility was in compliance with the  personnel surety performance standard. As an interim step, in February  2014, DHS published a notice about its Information Collection Request  (ICR) for personnel surety to gather information and comments prior to  submitting the ICR to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for  review and clearance. According to ISCD officials, it is unclear when the  personnel surety aspect of the CFATS program will be finalized.", "A biometric access control system consists of technology that determines an individual\u2019s  identity by detecting and matching unique physical or behavioral characteristics, such as  fingerprint or voice patterns, as a means of verifying personal identity. its usefulness with regard to the CFATS program. We recommended  that DHS take steps to resolve these issues, including completing a  security assessment that includes addressing internal controls  weaknesses, among other things. The explanatory statement  accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, directed DHS  to complete the recommended security assessment.February 2014, DHS had not yet done the assessment, and although  DHS had taken some steps to conduct an internal control review, it had  not corrected all the control deficiencies identified in our report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inspecting to Verify Compliance with Facility Plans", "paragraphs": ["DHS reports that it has begun to perform compliance inspections at  regulated facilities.

The Director further noted that the inspections would generally be  conducted approximately 1 year after plan approval. According to ISCD,  as of February 24, 2014, ISCD had conducted 12 compliance inspections.
