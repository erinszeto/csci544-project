Having, for example, more complete timeliness goals, and goals and  measures reflecting other areas of performance, would allow VA to better  identify and target risks associated with managing two processes in  parallel, including the potential that veterans with appeals in the legacy  process may experience significant delays relative to those in the new  appeals process.", "Importantly, VA is missing an opportunity to fully benefit from RAMP by  not testing and assessing other aspects of the new appeals process. The  Act authorizes VA to test the feasibility and advisability of any facet of the  new appeals process, and VA is taking a positive step to mitigate some  risks by testing the two review options available within VBA (review of a  claim by a higher-level official based on the same evidence and review of  a supplemental claim with additional evidence) through RAMP. In  November 2017, VA began RAMP by inviting 500 veterans whose  appeals have been pending the longest to participate. According to VA  officials, VA plans to continue offering RAMP to additional eligible  veterans with pending legacy appeals each month until January 2019\u2014a  month before VA anticipates fully implementing the new appeals system.  However, as designed, RAMP does not include features\u2014consistent with  a well-developed and documented pilot test program\u2014that would provide  VA with an opportunity to evaluate fully the soundness of new processes  and practices on a smaller scale. Specifically:", "VA\u2019s plan does not clearly define success criteria for RAMP: VA\u2019s  appeals plan states that the agency will collect certain data from  RAMP, such as the rate at which eligible veterans opt into the  process, timeliness of claims processing, and individual employee  productivity. VA also established an overall average processing time  goal of 125 days for the two VBA options; however, the plan and  supporting documentation did not clearly articulate whether RAMP  reviews are expected to meet this timeliness goal. The plan also did  not identify other success criteria for RAMP or the types of results  expected before fully implementing the new appeals process. For  example, VA\u2019s plan does not articulate the expected number and type  of subsequent appeals to the Board that result from RAMP.", "In commenting on our findings, VA noted that its intent in  implementing RAMP was to collect data and test aspects of the new  process, and that RAMP was not an initiative in and of itself. However,  developing performance measures and data gathering procedures  and defining success criteria for a pilot test before proceeding to full  implementation are sound practices for process redesign and pilot  testing. In addition, because RAMP was not included in VA\u2019s risk  assessment, we asked VA if it had identified any risks or mitigation  strategies specific to RAMP. In its supplemental materials, VA stated  that the greatest risk to RAMP is a low participation rate among  eligible veterans with legacy claims. VA also indicated that it would  need 10 percent of eligible veterans to opt into RAMP to yield  meaningful results. However, this threshold is not articulated in VA\u2019s  appeals plan as an explicit success criterion or objective. According to  data provided by VA, as of January 22, 2018, 238 veterans opted in.", "Of veterans with pending claims in RAMP, two-thirds chose the  higher-level review option. VA also reported that 47 RAMP decisions  have been made so far. As of yet, no appeals of RAMP decisions  have been filed.", "VA\u2019s plan does not articulate how it will assess RAMP before  proceeding with full implementation: Although VA\u2019s appeals plan  describes a \u201cclose-out\u201d phase in which VA intends to assess the  results of RAMP, it does not detail the conditions that would have to  be met (or not met) to trigger changes. For example, VA\u2019s plan does  not explain when or how it might respond to low opt-in rates for  RAMP\u2014other than stating it will increase outreach to eligible  veterans\u2014or to unexpectedly high appeal rates to the Board resulting  from RAMP decisions. Sound redesign and change management  practices both suggest that pilot tests be rigorously monitored and  evaluated, and that further roll-out occur only after an agency\u2019s  transition team takes any needed corrective action and determines  that the new process is achieving previously identified success  criteria. Without fully articulating its plan for deciding how and when to  roll out changes more broadly, it is not clear whether VA would be  prepared to fully implement a new appeals process that achieves its  aim of better serving veterans.", "RAMP does not test all aspects of the new appeals process:  RAMP provides an opportunity to learn about experiences at VBA  under the new system, such as the rate at which eligible veterans  choose those options and the resources that will be required to  process their appeals. However, RAMP was not designed to test how  many veterans would choose to appeal directly to the Board and,  therefore, it will not provide comparable information on the Board  appeals options. Sound workforce planning practices suggest that  agencies identify the total resources needed to manage the risk of  implementing new processes and conduct scenario planning to  determine those needs.", "In addition, although we previously recommended VA conduct additional  sensitivity analyses to inform projections of future appeals inventories,  VA\u2019s appeals plan does not reflect VA\u2019s use or intended use of sensitivity  analyses when projecting staffing needs for new appeals options at the  Board. In commenting on our findings, VA officials said they do not plan  to conduct additional sensitivity analyses to project future workloads until  they have more information from RAMP to inform their assumptions. As a  result, VA will lack data on scenarios in which veterans may  overwhelmingly choose options available at the Board over those at VBA  when the appeals plan is fully implemented. This presents a risk that VA\u2019s  early production projections and initial resource allocations may not be  properly balanced between the Board and VBA. This, in turn, may result  in an unexpectedly large number of appeals pending with the Board, and  corresponding lengthy average wait and decision times for some, if not  all, Board options.", "Having information on the number of veterans who are likely to appeal to  the Board is particularly critical, given that similar efforts to create  additional review options at VBA did not achieve their goals of reducing  the percentage of appeals that continue on to the Board. In 2001, VA  established the Decision Review Officer (DRO) process\u2014in which senior  staff have the authority to overturn an initial disability claim decision  without any new evidence\u2014to resolve more appeals at the regional level  and avoid long waits at the Board. However, we reported in 2011 that,  although the DRO process helped some veterans get additional benefits  at the regional office level, it did not accomplish the program\u2019s primary  goal of reducing the percentage of appeals continuing on to the Board.", "In responding to our findings, VA officials reiterated their plans to increase  outreach in the event of low opt-in rates for RAMP and indicated they  recently began to send follow-up RAMP invitation letters. With respect to  assessing all appeals options, VA officials stated that, while no legal bar  prevents testing of the Board options, the Board is focused on reducing  its inventory of pending appeals while RAMP provides early resolution of  appeals within the new VBA-only options. Officials conceded that this  approach means they cannot collect data on the rate at which veterans  opt to appeal directly to the Board (e.g., bypassing additional VBA review)  until the new process is fully implemented. However, they noted that they  can collect some data on the rate at which veterans whose appeals go  through RAMP file subsequent appeals to the Board, even though the  Board will not begin processing those appeals until full implementation. At  a January 2018 House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs hearing, the  Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs stated that given our assessment,  VA will adjust its approach to identify and mitigate risks associated with  implementing all of the appeals options, including those at the Board.", "Until VA pursues an approach that identifies and mitigates significant  risks associated with implementing a new process, VA is taking a chance  that untested aspects will not perform as desired. The Act provides VA  authority to pilot aspects of the process and flexibility on the timing of  implementing the new process, which could allow some additional time  for VA to carefully measure performance under RAMP and determine  whether any corrective actions are necessary. If VA does not take full  advantage of this authority, it risks moving forward without knowing  whether the new appeals process improves experiences for veterans, and  potentially implementing a process that is more expensive or results in  longer wait times than originally anticipated."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In implementing appeals reform after the enactment of the Veterans  Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017, VA is undertaking  a complex endeavor that has the potential to affect the lives of hundreds  of thousands of veterans with service-connected disabilities. Such an  endeavor demands a commensurate level of planning to be successful.  While the Act required VA to submit its plan within 90 days of enactment,  VA had proposed and began to plan for appeals reform much earlier, and  had our March 2017 recommendations to guide its planning efforts from a  foundation of sound practices.", "VA\u2019s November 2017 appeals plan is a positive step forward. Certain  elements of the plan\u2014such as establishing an agency-wide governance  structure to oversee implementation and testing aspects of reform prior to  full implementation\u2014are notable gains since our March 2017 report. At  the same time, the plan partially addresses or does not address five of  the required elements called for by the Act, such as delineating the total  resources required by VBA and the Board to implement and administer  the new appeals process and address legacy appeals. The plan also is  not fully responsive to our past recommendations and does not reflect a  number of sound planning practices that are essential for gauging  progress, establishing accountability, and linking resources to results.", "One such key practice is articulating a desired \u201cend state\u201d\u2014a vision for  what successful implementation would look like for the new appeals  process as well as the wind-down of the legacy process, such as  accurate and timely processing of appeals while ensuring veteran  satisfaction. Without establishing a complete and balanced set of goals  and related performance measures to achieve this end state, and  monitoring and assessing progress along the way, VA risks falling short of  its overarching objective\u2014to improve timeliness of appeals decisions for  veterans overall. By not fully articulating how it plans to monitor workloads  and devote resources to both the new and legacy processes, VA runs the  risk of disadvantaging veterans with legacy appeals relative to those in  the new process, or vice versa.", "Just as important is establishing a robust integrated master schedule\u2014 rather than a high-level timeline\u2014that is built upon and clearly reflects  extensive detailed planning and includes all activities necessary to  execute the program and interdependencies between these activities.  Without such a road map, VA\u2019s appeals plan does not provide reasonable  assurance that decision makers have the essential information needed to  manage this complex and important program.", "We are encouraged that VA has taken some steps toward assessing  risks, including establishing a risk register and implementing RAMP to  collect information on the two VBA appeals options. However, unless VA  assesses risks against a balanced set of goals and measures, VA may  not be fully aware of risks that may impede successful implementation of  appeals reform. Further, although VA will undoubtedly learn from the  RAMP experience, it may not learn all that it should from its efforts  without (1) establishing clear criteria for what success looks like (or the  circumstances that would cause VA to consider making course  corrections), and (2) building in time to take stock of the lessons learned  before moving to full implementation.", "VA\u2019s plan places a lot of weight on RAMP to, among other efforts,  mitigate risk and generate estimates of the resources needed for  successful implementation after fiscal year 2018, even though RAMP  does not fully test options for appealing to the Board that will be available  to veterans after full implementation. Unless VA addresses key risks  associated with fully implementing appeals reform\u2014by either testing or  conducting sensitivity analyses for all five appeals options, to better  understand potential workloads at the Board\u2014VA runs the risk of fully  implementing the process without knowing if it is improving the process  for veterans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following four recommendations to VA:  The Secretary of Veterans Affairs should address all of the required  elements in the Act in VA\u2019s appeals plan to Congress\u2014including  delineating resources required for all VBA and Board appeals options\u2014 using sensitivity analyses and RAMP results, where appropriate and  needed. (Recommendation 1)", "The Secretary of Veterans Affairs should clearly articulate in VA\u2019s appeals  plan how VA will monitor and assess the new appeals process compared  to the legacy process, including specifying a balanced set of goals and  measures\u2014such as timeliness goals for all VBA appeals options and  Board dockets, and measures of accuracy, veteran satisfaction, and  cost\u2014and related baseline data. (Recommendation 2)", "The Secretary of Veterans Affairs should augment the master schedule  for VA\u2019s appeals plan to reflect all activities\u2014such as modifications to IT  systems\u2014as well as assigned responsibilities, interdependencies, start  and end dates for key activities for each workgroup, and resources, to  establish accountability and reduce overall risk of implementation failures.  (Recommendation 3)", "The Secretary of Veterans Affairs should ensure that the appeals plan  more fully addresses risk associated with appeals reform\u2014for example,  by assessing risks against a balanced set of goals and measures,  articulating success criteria and an assessment plan for RAMP, and  testing or conducting sensitivity analyses of all appeals options\u2014prior to  fully implementing the new appeals process.

VA did not provide technical comments.", "With respect to our first recommendation that VA address all the required  elements in the Act in VA\u2019s appeals plan (including delineating total  resources), VA stated that both VBA and the Board will use existing  resources to implement the new appeals process. VA also stated it plans  to take additional steps to determine resource requirements for  addressing workloads under both the legacy and new appeals process.  For VBA, VA stated that it will continue to rely on RAMP to project  resource requirements, while acknowledging the need to augment its  analysis of RAMP data by adopting additional strategies to project  resource requirements. VA did not describe these strategies, but stated  that it will share them with Congress and GAO in the near future.  Meanwhile, VA noted that its 2019 budget request includes 605 additional  FTEs for VBA to process appeals, but did not indicate how it developed  this budget request. For the Board, VA stated that it plans to develop  better predictions regarding resource allocations among dockets by  leveraging project management and other support within the agency. We  will continue to monitor VA\u2019s efforts to delineate needed resources,  including how it uses the results of pilot tests and prediction analysis.", "With respect to our second recommendation to articulate how it will  monitor and assess the new appeals process compared to the legacy  process, VA stated that it is working to develop a complete and balanced  set of measures for the new appeals process, and timeliness goals for all  appeals options. Further, VA indicated it will track performance for Board  appeal options using an existing process. We are encouraged by VA\u2019s  proposed actions, which will provide a more complete picture of VA\u2019s  vision for the new appeals process. However, VA does not detail whether  or how the agency will develop a baseline or compare performance of the  new appeals process to the legacy process. Until VA develops a baseline  and a plan for monitoring and assessing both the new and legacy  processes\u2014using a complete and balanced set of goals and measures\u2014 VA risks not fully understanding whether the new process is an  improvement.", "With respect to our third recommendation to augment its master  implementation schedule to manage the project, VA provided an updated  schedule with additional key activities and responsibilities, such as  RAMP. Moreover, VA restated its plans to use an agency-wide  governance structure to coordinate and track implementation of its new  appeals process. We are encouraged by VA\u2019s efforts to develop a more  detailed implementation schedule. However, the updated schedule VA  provided does not include major activities, such as integrated IT system  testing, and completion dates for major activities, for example, adding  functionality to VA\u2019s primary claims processing system. In addition, VA  provided an updated calendar for six major IT activities through the end of  calendar year 2018. However, we continue to believe that VA will need to  develop a longer term schedule that projects when processes will be  integrated into new systems and when new systems will be ready to  support the new appeals process. The schedule also does not indicate  whether activities are interrelated, such that a delay in one activity could  affect other activities and thereby affect VA\u2019s estimated implementation  date. This sound planning practice is especially important because VA  stated the agency is concurrently executing many of the activities.", "With respect of our fourth recommendation to more fully assess risks  associated with appeals reform prior to its full implementation, VA stated  that it will assess risks against a balanced set of goals it plans to select.  Moreover, using its existing risk management process, VA stated it has  identified additional risks and mitigation strategies after submitting its  November 2017 plan. For example, VA states that it is addressing the  continued low opt-in rate for RAMP, which is testing the new VBA-only  options. VA is also acknowledging that delays in the development of IT  required to implement the appeals process may prevent the agency from  certifying readiness in January 2019. Importantly, VA states that the  Board is exploring the development of a pilot program to identify needs  and concerns related to full implementation\u2014including all Board appeals  options\u2014and to make predictions about timeliness and productivity under  the new appeals process. However, VA did not define success criteria for  its current pilot test, RAMP, or clearly articulate how the agency will  assess results of either RAMP or a new test of Board appeals options  before proceeding to full implementation.

We focused on the plan as presented, rather than auditing the information  VA relied on in developing the plan.

We concluded  that VA\u2019s plan addressed all sub-parts of this element because it provided  a description of required IT modifications, a reference to costs included in  the Appeals Modernization IT budget, and a timeline. However, our  determination that VA addressed this element should not be construed to  necessarily mean that VA fully identified or described all IT requirements,  or provided complete estimated costs and timelines associated with those  requirements, or that the information in VA\u2019s appeals plan comported with  sound planning practices.
