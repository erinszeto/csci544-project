CBP and FAA assessed vulnerabilities but not threats and consequences. ARS and the Forest Service assessed threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences, but did not use these factors to measure risk. In addition, the agencies considered many, but not all 33 undesirable events related to physical security as possible risks to their facilities. Agencies are taking steps to improve their methodologies. For example, ARS and the Forest Service now use a methodology that measures risk and plan to incorporate the methodology into policy. Although CBP and FAA have updated their methodologies, their policies do not require methodologies that fully align with the ISC standard. As a result, these agencies miss the opportunity for a more informed assessment of the risk to their facilities.", "All four agencies reported facing management challenges in conducting physical security assessments or monitoring assessment results. Specifically, CBP, ARS, and the Forest Service have not met the ISC's required time frame of every 3 years for conducting assessments. For example, security specialists have not conducted required reassessments of two ARS and one Forest Service higher-level facilities. While these three agencies have plans to address backlogs, CBP's plan does not balance conducting risk assessments with other competing security priorities, such as updating its policy manual, and ARS and the Forest Service lack a means to monitor completion of future assessments. Furthermore, CBP, ARS, and the Forest Service did not have the data or information systems to monitor assessment schedules or the status of countermeasures at facilities, and their policies did not specify such data requirements. For example, ARS and the Forest Service do not collect and analyze security-related data, such as countermeasures' implementation. FAA does not routinely monitor the performance of its physical security program. Without improved monitoring, agencies are not well equipped to prioritize their highest security needs, may leave facilities' vulnerabilities unaddressed, and may not take corrective actions to meet physical security program objectives.

In light of  these incidents and other emergent threats, it is important that agencies  use risk-based methodologies to assess the physical security needs of  the approximately 113,000 executive-branch, non-military federal  buildings.

However, our past work found that some federal agencies used this  standard to varying degrees leaving agencies\u2019 facilities, workforce, and  visitors exposed to risk. You asked us to examine how federal agencies  with protective responsibilities use risk management to protect their  facilities with countermeasures that meet their security needs.

To  determine how these agencies\u2019 assessment methodologies align with The  Risk Management Process for Federal Facilities (the ISC Standard), we  compared facility security policies and procedures from the departments  and agencies to the criteria and process in the ISC Standard. In addition,  we selected 13 facilities within these 4 agencies for site visits based on  geographical dispersion and high levels of risk. For each of the selected  facilities, we reviewed assessment reports, toured the facilities, and  identified the status of recommended countermeasures. We interviewed  officials from the ISC, 3 departments, 4 agencies, and the 13 facilities to  understand security standards, policies, and procedures; agency-specific  assessment processes; management challenges; and guidance for  prioritizing physical security needs. We did not independently determine  what constitutes a management challenge, but relied on these facility  managers and agency security staff to identify their concerns as defined  in their own policies and procedures. We reviewed Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government (Standards for Internal Control)  regarding risk management criteria and the use of quality information for  our evaluation of the agencies\u2019 abilities to monitor their physical security  program.

Murrah Federal Building in April 1995. The  ISC\u2019s mandate is to enhance the quality and effectiveness of security in  and protection of federal facilities in the United States occupied by federal  employees for nonmilitary activities. The order directs the ISC to  develop and evaluate security standards for federal facilities, develop a  strategy to ensure executive agencies and departments comply with such  standards, and oversee the implementation of appropriate security  measures in federal facilities. The ISC has released a body of standards,  including the ISC Standard, designed to apply to the physical security  efforts of all federal, non-military agencies. The ISC Standard prescribes  a process for agencies to follow in developing their risk assessment  methodologies (see fig. 2).", "Most federal departments and agencies are generally responsible for  protecting their own facilities and have physical security programs in  place to do so. The ISC Standard requires executive departments and  agencies to follow the risk-management process when conducting risk  assessments for each of their facilities. That process begins with  determining the facility security level, ranging from level I (lowest risk) for  facilities generally having 100 or fewer employees to level V (highest risk)  for the most critical facilities and generally having greater than 750  employees. The security level designation determines the facility\u2019s baseline countermeasures. For each facility, departments and agencies  are required to (a) consider all of the \u201cundesirable events\u201d that could pose  a risk to their facilities\u2014 such as active shooters, vandalism, and  explosions\u2014and (b) assess three factors of risk (threats, vulnerabilities,  and consequences) to specific undesirable events. Subsequently,  agencies are to combine all three factors to yield a measurable level of  risk for each undesirable event (see app. III). Based on the results of  these assessments, agencies should customize (either increase or  decrease) the countermeasures to adequately reflect the assessed level  of risk.", "In addition, as part of planning for physical security resources within an  agency\u2019s budget process, the ISC has identified the need to balance  allocations for countermeasures with other operational needs and with  competing priorities. The ISC Best Practices have some similarities with  leading practices in capital decision-making. For example, both state that  the allocation of resources should be integrated into the agency\u2019s  mission, objectives, goals, and budget process. However, beyond the ISC  Best Practices, the Office of Management and Budget and we have  developed more comprehensive leading practices in capital decision- making that provide agencies with guidance for prioritizing budget  decisions such as for countermeasure projects. The Office of  Management and Budget and our guidance also emphasize evaluating a  full range of alternatives, informed by agency asset inventories that  contain condition information, to bridge any identified performance gap.  Furthermore, the guidance calls for a comprehensive decision-making  framework to review, rank, and select from among competing project  proposals. Such a framework should include the appropriate levels of  management review, and selections should be based on the use of  established criteria.", "The following describes the mission and physical security program  characteristics for the agencies in our review:", "CBP, the nation\u2019s largest law enforcement agency, has responsibility  for securing the country\u2019s borders.

The ISC gives agencies some  flexibility to design their own security-assessment methodologies for  identifying necessary countermeasures as long as the chosen  methodology adheres to fundamental principles of a sound risk- management methodology. Specifically, methodologies must:  consider all of the undesirable events identified in the ISC Standard  as possible risks to federal facilities, and assess three factors of risk (threats, vulnerabilities, and  consequences) for each of the events.", "Furthermore, the ISC Standard requires executive departments and  agencies to document decisions that deviate from the ISC Standard.  Agencies\u2019 policies and methodologies reference the ISC Standard.  However, none of the agencies\u2019 methodologies considered all of the  undesirable events during assessments although they used some type of  risk assessment methodology. In addition, the agencies did not always  adhere to these principles of risk management (see table 1).", "At the time of our review, CBP\u2019s methodology did not fully align with the  ISC Standard because it did not consider all of the 33 undesirable events  nor assess threat and consequence. CBP security specialists assessed  vulnerabilities at building entrances and exits, in interior rooms, and  around the perimeter using a yes/no checklist during the assessment  process. However, assessment reports showed that specialists did not  assess the threats and consequences of undesirable events at each  facility. According to security officials, the gap occurred because they  designed the checklist to meet requirements in the 2009 CBP Security  Policy and Procedures Handbook, which predates the first edition of the  ISC Standard issued in 2010. CBP officials told us that as of January  2017, they began using an improved methodology to assess the threats,  vulnerabilities, and consequences for 30 of 33 undesirable events\u2014 omitting three now identified in the November 2016 revision to the ISC  Standard. However, CBP has not yet updated its handbook to align with  the ISC Standard, even though it started this effort over 3 years ago in  December 2013. CBP officials did not provide a draft of its updated  handbook, but they provided a plan with milestone dates for issuing the  handbook by September 2018. CBP officials also told us that updates to  the handbook may have to wait due to competing priorities, including  efforts to address the backlog of assessments (which we discuss later in  this report). Delays in updating the handbook mean that CBP\u2019s policy will  continue to not align with the ISC Standard. Furthermore, although CBP  security officials told us that all of the agency\u2019s security specialists have  been trained to use the improved assessment methodology, without  documentation of the methodology in agency policy, there may be greater  risk of its inconsistent application. Standards for Internal Control  emphasize the importance of agencies developing and documenting  policies to ensure agency-wide objectives are met. Documentation serves  to retain institutional knowledge over time when questions about previous  decisions arise. Without an updated policy handbook that requires a  methodology that assesses all undesirable events consistent with the ISC  Standard, CBP cannot reasonably ensure that its facilities will have levels  of protection commensurate to their risk.", "FAA\u2019s methodology does not fully align with the ISC Standard because it  does not consider all of the 33 undesirable events nor does it assess all  three factors of risk. FAA security specialists assess vulnerabilities to the  site perimeter, entryways, and interior rooms using a yes/no checklist, but  the checklist does not assess the consequences from each of the  undesirable events at each facility. With respect to threat, FAA applies the  ISC\u2019s baseline threat\u2014a general federal facilities threat level that relates  directly to a set of baseline countermeasures\u2014across all its higher-level  facilities because FAA policy states that there is no agency-specific threat  that exceeds the current baseline threat. According to FAA officials, the  baseline threat standardizes the security needs across their facilities  rather than addressing the security needs of individual facilities from  specific threats. When necessary, FAA policy allows specialists to modify  countermeasures based on an evaluation of conditions at the facility.", "FAA realized that this approach was no longer appropriate given the  agency-wide goal to make risk-based decisions, a review of the  assessment process after a 2014 Chicago fire incident that destroyed  critical FAA equipment, and an awareness of ISC initiatives to assess  compliance. To address the resulting methodological gaps, FAA hired a  contractor to design, develop, test, and validate an improved risk- assessment methodology. Subsequently, FAA improved its methodology  in January 2017 to assess the threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences  for 30 of the 33 undesirable events identified in the November 2016  revision to the ISC Standard \u2014and tested the methodology at lower-  and higher-level facilities. This revised methodology addresses the need  to assess individual facility needs rather than using a standardized  baseline approach. In April 2017, FAA officials told us of their plan for  implementing this methodology and provided tentative milestone dates to  conduct further testing, training, and analysis before deciding to use the  improved methodology, which they expect to complete by January 2018.  However, their plan lacks the necessary information to ensure successful  implementation, such as detail on how many facilities they will test and  how they will use the results of testing, training, and analysis to  implement the improved methodology within the identified 9-month time  frame. Furthermore, the improved methodology does not address  undesirable events for which ISC issued countermeasures in May 2017.  Without a detailed implementation plan to assess the methodology\u2019s  impact on its security program, FAA cannot reasonably ensure that its  facilities have the proper countermeasures. With ongoing changes to its  security program, FAA has an opportunity to fully align its improved  methodology with the ISC Standard by including all 33 undesirable events  and to update its policy requiring the use of such a methodology.", "Unlike CBP and FAA\u2014which developed their own methodologies  separate from their parent departments (Department of Homeland  Security (DHS) and Department of Transportation (DOT), respectively)\u2014 ARS and the Forest Service follow an assessment methodology  developed by USDA. USDA\u2019s methodology does not fully align with the  ISC Standard because it does not consider all of the 33 undesirable  events for which ISC issued countermeasures in May 2017. Security  specialists from USDA headquarters typically assess ARS\u2019s and the  Forest Service\u2019s higher-level facilities using a risk-based methodology  that considers the 31 undesirable events listed in the previous version of  the ISC Standard dated August 2013. However, until recently, USDA did  not assign ratings to each of the three risk factors\u2014threat, vulnerability,  and consequence\u2014and then combine these ratings to yield a measurable  level of risk for each undesirable event. USDA security officials said that  they have revised the assessment-reporting format to include this risk  calculation and trained their specialists to measure risk in this way. USDA  officials provided us with a new assessment template that addresses all  33 undesirable events and includes measuring risk. Additionally, USDA  officials said that they are revising their outdated physical security manual  and expect to complete it by April 2018. With a revised manual and  application of the new assessment template, USDA should be better  positioned to assess risk at its facilities.", "When agencies do not use methodologies that fully align with the ISC  Standard, they could face deleterious effects, ranging from facilities  having inappropriate levels of protection to agencies having an inability to  make informed resource allocation decisions for their physical security  needs. Specifically, the ISC Standard states that facilities may face the  effect of either having (1) less protection than needed resulting in  inadequate security or (2) more protection than needed resulting in an  unnecessary use of resources. The ISC Standard also states that these  effects can be negated by determining the proper protection according to  a risk assessment. Identified excess resources in one risk area then can  be reallocated to underserved areas, thus ensuring the most cost- effective security program is implemented. As an illustration of such  potential effects, we found that two agencies assessing two higher-level  facilities came to two different conclusions in terms of their need for X-ray  machines to screen for guns, knives, and other prohibitive items in federal  facilities. Specifically, one agency based its decision on a policy that does  not deviate from the ISC\u2019s baseline set of countermeasures, and the other  agency based its decision on professional judgement that deviated from  the ISC\u2019s baseline set of countermeasures. Neither agency based its  decision on a risk assessment nor documented its decision\u2014both ISC  requirements, specifically:", "Without conducting a risk assessment, FAA recently expanded a  policy requirement calling for all higher-level facilities to have X-ray  machines and magnetometers. This new requirement poses a  potentially sizeable investment for the agency with an estimated cost  of X-ray machines of about $24,000 and magnetometers of about  $4,000 each. FAA may need such equipment at all its higher-level  facilities. However, the ISC Standard requires that agencies conduct  risk assessments first to justify their needs. Without conducting risk  assessments, FAA managers could unnecessarily use resources by  installing such equipment in all higher-level air traffic facilities when  there may be higher priority needs", "A USDA security specialist decided, despite an ISC baseline  requirement that higher\u2013level facilities have X-ray machines, not to  recommend an X-ray machine at a higher-level Forest Service facility.  The specialist reasoned that unlike other federal buildings with  numerous unknown visitors, this facility receives mostly known  individuals and a limited number of visitors. The ISC Standard allows  for professional judgement; however, the ISC requires that agencies  document deviations from the baseline set of countermeasures.  Reducing the facility\u2019s level of protection without documenting an  assessment of risk could result in no record of the basis of the  decision for current and future facility managers and security officials  to review or use as justification in the case of a question of  compliance.", "In another case, we found that one higher-level facility did not have  access control for employees or visitors nor did it have armed guard  patrols. The facility manager told us that intelligence and a history  without incidents gave leadership reason to believe that these measures  were not needed and that therefore the agency did not require and would  not fund such protective measures for this facility\u2014in effect, accepting the  risks to the facility. Security officials said they also had the same  understanding and did not document the matter in the assessment report  even though agency policy and the ISC Standard require written  documentation when officials deviate from the baseline requirement.", "Without security assessments that fully align with the ISC Standard and  provide measureable levels of risk, agencies do not have the information  they need to determine priorities and make informed resource allocation  decisions. For example, they may not be able to assess whether to  acquire or forego costly physical-security countermeasures\u2014such as, X- ray machines, access control systems, and closed-circuit television  systems\u2014for facilities. Additionally, after determining the need to acquire  a countermeasure, agencies must fund the countermeasure. As  previously discussed, leading practices in capital decision-making include  a comprehensive framework to review, rank, and select from competing  project proposals for funding. In conducting risk assessments that do  not fully align with the ISC Standard (i.e., not assessing threats,  vulnerabilities, and consequences and measuring risks), agencies miss  the opportunity for more informed funding decisions. Three of the four  agencies (CBP, ARS, and the Forest Service) currently prioritize funding  for operational needs over physical security needs (see table 2) when  agencies\u2019 priorities might be different if they based their decisions on an  aligned risk assessment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Agencies Reported Facing Challenges in Conducting Security Assessments and Monitoring Results", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agencies Have Not Conducted Timely Security Assessments", "paragraphs": ["Standards for Internal Control state that agencies should use quality  information on an ongoing basis as a means to monitor program activities  and take corrective action, as necessary.

We found that three of  the four agencies (CBP, ARS, and the Forest Service) did not meet this  requirement. Officials reported various challenges including (1)  assessments competing with other security activities, (2) an insufficient  number of qualified staff to conduct assessments when compared to the  number of facilities, or (3) not knowing of the required assessment  schedule.", "An \u201cinformation system\u201d is the people, processes, data, and technology that  management organizes to obtain, communicate, or dispose of information. that had not been reassessed since 2010. CBP security officials attributed  the backlog to (1) having too few security specialists assigned to assess  about 1,200 facilities and (2) the specialists working on competing  priorities, such as revising the security handbook, conducting technical  inspections, and reviewing new construction designs and renovation  projects. According to CBP security officials, they have developed a plan  to eliminate the backlog by the end of fiscal year 2018 by prioritizing the  completion of assessments. While we found the plan comprehensive, the  schedule did not seem feasible. For example, the plan assumes that one  specialist can complete six assessments in 3 consecutive days and that  another specialist can complete three assessments in 1 day. In contrast,  security officials told us specialists take about 20 work hours (or 2\u00bd days)  to conduct an on-site assessment of one facility. CBP officials said that  they believe they can meet the time frames of the plan because they have  set aside other priorities and have a thorough understanding of the scope  of work involved at the facilities. They added that it will not be easy to  meet the timeline, but they can accomplish it with a motivated and  committed workforce, adequate financial resources, and absent activities  that would otherwise require shifting of resources. We question the  feasibility of setting aside important priorities, such as updating the policy  manual and reviewing physical security elements in new construction  designs, as well as the workload assumptions for completing the  assessments. Further, these other priorities are also key to securing  facilities. Without balancing assessments with competing priorities, CBP\u2019s  time frames for completing the assessments by the end of fiscal year  2018 may not be feasible and may also result in the agency\u2019s not  addressing other important physical security responsibilities.", "Since the ISC issued its standard in 2010, ARS and the Forest Service  have assessed their higher-level facilities at least once. However, these  agencies have not reassessed all of their higher-level facilities within the  3-year interval requirement. Specifically, security specialists have not  conducted required reassessments of two ARS and one Forest Service  higher-level facilities. The ARS headquarters official explained that the  agency had not reassessed the two facilities due to competing priorities  and insufficient internal resources. During the course of our review, ARS  headquarters officials said they began assessing one of the two ARS  facilities in May 2017 and will begin assessing the second facility in  October 2017. The Forest Service official explained that the agency  missed its security reassessment of the regional office because the  facility staff had not requested one. During our visit, facility staff  responsible for security told us that they were not aware of the ISC\u2019s 3- year interval requirement. Facility staff requested a reassessment, and  security officials told us that they expected to complete it by mid-June  2017.

CBP facility officials gave reasons why recommended  countermeasures had not been implemented. At one facility, officials  did not know about the recommended countermeasures from its last  2010 assessment because the individuals previously knowledgeable  about the assessments left the organization without communicating  the results. By taking action to improve facility security, they  implemented some needed countermeasures. However, at the time of  our review, a large number of the recommendations remained open.  At another facility, officials told us that they too had not known (for the  same reason mentioned above) of their 2010 assessment, which  contained recommended countermeasures. However, these officials  told us that they submitted a funding request a few weeks before our  visit to address all except one of the open countermeasures.

However, when the object near the fence  is a building and the property outside of the fence is not federally owned  (see bottom right photo, fig. 3), it may not be cost effective to correct the  clear zone violation.

With this responsibility comes the need to appropriately assess risk to  ensure the security of these agencies\u2019 facilities. However, 7 years after  the ISC issued its initial risk-management process standard, each of four  selected agencies continued to use assessment methodologies that did  not fully align with this standard. During our review, agencies improved  their methodologies to better align with the ISC Standard, but the  agencies had not yet incorporated the methodologies into their policies  and procedures. Without updated policies and procedures requiring a  methodology that adheres to the ISC Standard (including all 33  undesirable events now identified in the November 2016 revision to the  ISC Standard), agencies may not collect the information needed to  assess risk and determine priorities for improved security. This situation  could hamper the agencies\u2019 ability to make informed resource allocation  decisions or to recommend countermeasures commensurate to the needs  at specific facilities. To address challenges in conducting timely  assessments, agencies that had a backlog developed plans to address  them, but the assumptions used in CBP\u2019s plans and time frames did not  appear to fully reflect the agency\u2019s competing priorities and actual  experience. Additionally, ARS and Forest Service have not implemented  a long-term assessment schedule with key milestones to ensure that  higher-level facilities are reassessed at least once every 3 years. Further,  in cases where the agencies may have had risk assessment information,  CBP, ARS, and the Forest Service lack the means to collect, store, and  analyze this information in order to monitor the status of a facility\u2019s  security.

We reviewed the  Federal Real Property Council\u2019s data on the Federal Real Property Profile  to identify federally owned and agency-controlled buildings. We  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of our  reporting objectives based upon our recent report that reviewed these  data fields. We selected four agencies based upon their large quantity of  reported federally owned and agency-controlled buildings: DHS, U.S.  Customs and Border Protection (CBP); Department of Transportation  (DOT), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA); United States Department  of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and USDA\u2019s  United States Forest Service (Forest Service). This methodology  purposely does not include federal buildings protected by FPS and under  the control of the General Services Administration as well as other  agencies that we reported on in our previous work. We obtained and  reviewed one particular ISC standard, The Risk Management Process for  Federal Facilities (the ISC Standard) and its related appendices for  assessing physical security and providing recommended  countermeasures at federal facilities. We obtained and analyzed the  selected departments\u2019 and agencies\u2019 facility-security policies and  procedures for a risk assessment methodology. According to the ISC  Standard, agencies\u2019 risk assessment methodologies must:  consider all of the undesirable events identified in the ISC Standard  as possible risks to federal facilities as listed in appendix III; assess the threat, consequences, and vulnerability to specific produce similar or identical results when applied by various security provide sufficient justification for deviations from the ISC-defined  security baseline.", "We limited the scope of this review to the first two standards above  because agencies\u2019 adherence to these standards could be objectively  verified by reviewing and analyzing agency documentation and  interviewing agency officials, and their adherence to the two additional  standards could not be verified in this manner. We did not conduct risk  assessments with independent security professionals to evaluate: 1) the  results from prior agency evaluations and 2) the sufficiency of  justifications for deviations from the ISC-defined security baseline, as  both evaluations were outside of the scope of the engagement.  Therefore, for the purposes of this report, risk assessment policies,  procedures and resulting methodology that align with ISC standards are  those that consider all of the undesirable events and assess the threats,  consequences, and vulnerabilities to specific undesirable events. We  reviewed and analyzed information to answer the following five questions:  1.   Do the policies and procedures mention the ISC standards?  2.  Do the policies and procedures consider all of the undesirable  events?  3.  Do the policies and procedures assess the threat of specific  undesirable events?  4.  Do the policies and procedures assess the consequences of specific  undesirable events?  5.  Do the policies and procedures assess the vulnerability to specific  undesirable events?", "We answered each of these questions as either a \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d for our  selected agencies. The \u201cNo\u201d answer to questions 3, 4, and 5 includes the  following two possibilities: (a) the agency\u2019s threat, consequence, or  vulnerability ratings are not tied to specific undesirable events, or (b) the  agency does not have a framework or formalized steps within which it  collects and analyzes threat-, consequence-, or vulnerability-related  information. If the answer to each of the five questions was \u201cYes,\u201d then  the agency\u2019s overall risk assessment methodology aligns with ISC risk  assessment standards for the purposes of this report. If the answer to one  or more of the five questions was \u201cNo\u201d, then the agency\u2019s methodology  does not to align with ISC standards for the purposes of this report.", "We interviewed security officials at ISC; three departments (DHS, DOT,  and USDA); and four agencies (CBP, FAA, ARS, and the Forest Service).  We obtained and analyzed agency guidance on prioritizing physical  security needs and interviewed agencies\u2019 facility maintenance and budget  officials. We reviewed the ISC\u2019s best practices for planning for physical  security resources within an agency budget process. Additionally, we  reviewed the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s and our leading  practices in capital decision-making that provide agencies with guidance  for prioritizing budget decisions such as \u201ccountermeasure projects.\u201d We  also reviewed Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  because internal controls play a significant role in helping agencies  achieve their mission-related responsibilities.

We requested agency security officials to provide portfolio- wide  data on facility security assessments for our review in order to select sites  to visit and analyze data for dates of assessments and the status of  findings. We assessed the reliability of this data through interviews with  knowledgeable agency staff and a review for completeness and any  unexpected values. We compiled information from physical security  assessments when no portfolio-wide agency data were available. We  determined that these data were sufficient for the purpose of our reporting  objectives and selected geographically dispersed sites with buildings with  higher reported security levels per the ISC Standard, as these higher  security levels have greater requirements and therefore the potential for  greater resource needs. See appendix II for the 13 sites we selected. For  these selected sites, we interviewed agency staff concerning the  assessment process, site-specific findings, recommendations, justification  for deviations from ISC\u2019s baseline standards, and management  challenges faced in addressing physical security needs. We observed  and photographed the status of the findings from the site physical security  assessments. We did not independently determine what constitutes a  management challenge or a physical security finding. Rather, we relied  on these stakeholders to determine these physical security concerns as  defined in their own standards and guidance. The information from our  selected sites is illustrative and cannot be generalized to sites agency- wide.", "The performance audit upon which this report is based was conducted  from June 2016 to August 2017 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.
