Money laundering provides the fuel for drug  dealers, terrorists, arms dealers, and other criminals to operate and expand  their criminal enterprises.

In  the first, or placement, stage, cash is converted into monetary instruments,  such as money orders or travelers\u2019 checks, or deposited into financial  institution accounts. The later stages of money laundering are the layering  and integration stages.

The database  analysis FinCEN conducted in response to our request found that some  banks had filed SARs pertaining to possible money laundering/  BSA/structuring violations and credit, debit, or ATM cards. FinCEN  conducted an analysis of the database and found that between October 1,  1999, and September 30, 2001, banks had filed 499 SARs related to credit,  debit, or ATM cards and potential money laundering. This represents a  significantly small percentage of the total of all SARs filed in this period:  about one-tenth of 1 percent. FinCEN\u2019s analysis identified some examples  of the type of suspicious activity banks reported that related to the layering  and integration stages of money laundering:   Fifteen of the 499 SARs related to customers overpaying their credit  cards and subsequently asking for refund checks. FinCEN noted that  overpaying a credit card could be used as a means to launder money  because it provides a simple means to convert criminal or suspicious  funds to a bank instrument with minimal or no questions as to the origin  of the funds.", "One hundred fifteen of the 499 SARs related to customers trying to  structure deposits\u2014that is, making multiple deposits below the $10,000  threshold that would trigger a bank\u2019s filing a Currency Transaction  Report (CTR). Most of these SARs related to cash transactions wherein  the customer asked to deposit funds into various accounts, pay down  loans, purchase cashiers\u2019 checks, and make credit card payments.

Specifically, this bank filed SARs on four suspects. The bank reported that  check payments credited to the four suspects\u2019 credit card accounts were  made by a fifth individual.

The associations monitor these transactions as they  pass through the associations\u2019 networks and related fraud screens. The  monitoring systems have helped member banks, some of which must be  subscribers to the associations\u2019 fraud services, to identify and investigate  suspicious activity.

Most of the issuers we spoke  with had broad AML programs, but only three of the nine in our review had  AML policies and programs specifically addressing credit card operations.  Nevertheless, all of the issuers told us that they applied fraud and credit  risk policies and controls to screen credit card applications and monitored  the card transactions of approved cardholders. In addition, issuers told us  that they placed restrictions on cash and prepayment transactions.", "The issuers told us that they had application screening procedures to  authenticate the applicant and review the applicant for purposes of  identifying potential fraud. The issuers said that they authenticate  applicants by verifying employment, address, social security number, or  other application information against external sources such as public,  credit bureau, or employer records. To review the applicant for potential  fraud, some issuers said that they try to match the applicant\u2019s name and  other identifying information against names and information on public  records and industry lists, or  \u201cnegative lists\u201d\u2014lists containing names and  addresses associated with fraudulent activity. Three issuers also said that  they declined to process applications with foreign addresses. Most of the  issuers, furthermore, told us that they matched the applicant's name and  address against the OFAC list of prohibited individuals or entities. The  issuers believe that their application screening process, as a whole, enables  them to identify and reject applicants who have been associated with  fraudulent activity or show a potential for fraud or other criminal activity,  including money laundering. However, since the issuers rely on public  records or lists of names and addresses known for fraud, the issuers\u2019  screening process may not capture all fraudulent or criminal activity. For  example, applicants who have no negative credit or criminal history would  be able to avoid scrutiny and detection under their screening process,  according to the issuers.", "The issuers told us that they also monitor the card transactions of approved  cardholders for fraud and changes in credit status. The issuers believed  that their automated monitoring aids in reducing the risk of fraud or  potential cases of money laundering via credit cards; however, they were  unable to cite any cases of money laundering identified as a result of their  fraud controls. The issuers used fraud risk scoring models to monitor  transactions by frequency, type, dollar size, and location and determine  whether the transaction is unusual, out of pattern, or potentially  fraudulent. Several of the issuers said that if their automated monitoring  identifies card transactions that significantly deviate from a cardholder\u2019s  expected spending pattern, the transaction is flagged and their system  alerts them, giving them the flexibility to exercise several options. These  options include:  denying authorization for the credit purchase;  concluding that the transaction is suspicious and investigating it;  cuing the issuer\u2019s system to collect additional information;  filing a SAR about the transaction to FinCEN and, if urgent, notifying   canceling the cardholder\u2019s account; and  referring the cardholder\u2019s name to an industry negative list.", "Issuers indicated that they defer to law enforcement to determine whether  their reports of suspicious activities involve money laundering.", "With respect to prepayments, issuers said they monitor prepayments and  the large credit balances that prepayments generate. Some issuers asserted  that their monitoring effort creates a \u201ctransaction trail\u201d that exposes  possible money launderers and money laundering activities, and thereby  makes credit cards a tool disfavored by money launderers.", "The issuers varied in how they monitored prepayments and credit  balances. For example, a few said that they flagged and tracked all credit  balances. Others said that they tracked them by size of prepayment, giving  more scrutiny to large prepayments in terms of absolute dollars or as a  proportion of a customer\u2019s credit line. Other characteristics that issuers  said they tracked include credit balance size and discernable suspicious  pattern. The issuers also stated that they limited the amounts that a  cardholder carrying a credit balance could withdraw from the card, and  they monitored the reduction of credit balances by type and location of  reductions. For example, when the cardholder wished to reduce the credit  balance by obtaining cash advances, quasi-cash (such as gambling chips),  or credit purchases, the issuers monitored these transactions and limited  the amounts the cardholder could access.", "Several of the issuers further stated that if cardholders with large credit  balances asked for refunds, the issuers tracked these transactions and did  not automatically give the refunds. Some issuers told us that they first  reviewed or investigated the request for a refund, or required the  cardholder to submit a written request for the refund, as provided by  Regulation Z. For example, an issuer told us that in mid-September 2001,  their system flagged a large credit balance, and the cardholder, who was  staying at a major hotel in Boston, requested an immediate refund through  wire transfer to a checking account. The cardholder reportedly wanted to  leave the United States and travel via private plane to a Middle Eastern  country.

This association will review its entire membership in the United States and  abroad.
