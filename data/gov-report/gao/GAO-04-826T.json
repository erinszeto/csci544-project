The Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), the federal agency that administers the national regulatory program to ensure safe pipeline transportation, has been undertaking a broad range of activities to make pipeline transportation safer. However, the number of serious accidents--those involving deaths, injuries, and property damage of $50,000 or more--has not fallen. Among other things, OPS takes enforcement action against pipeline operators when safety problems are found. OPS has several enforcement tools to require the correction of safety violations. It can also assess monetary sanctions (civil penalties). This testimony is based on ongoing work for the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and for other committees, as required by the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002. The testimony provides preliminary results on (1) the effectiveness of OPS's enforcement strategy and (2) OPS's assessment of civil penalties."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The effectiveness of OPS's enforcement strategy cannot be determined because the agency has not incorporated three key elements of effective program management--clear program goals, a well-defined strategy for achieving goals, and performance measures that are linked to program goals. Without these key elements, the agency cannot determine whether recent and planned changes in its strategy will have the desired effects on pipeline safety. Over the past several years, OPS has focused on other efforts--such as developing a new risk-based regulatory approach--that it believes will change the safety culture of the industry. While OPS has become more aggressive in enforcing its regulations, it now intends to further strengthen the management of its enforcement program. In particular, OPS is developing an enforcement policy that will help define its enforcement strategy and has taken initial steps toward identifying new performance measures. However, OPS does not plan to finalize the policy until 2005 and has not adopted key practices for achieving successful performance measurement systems, such as linking measures to goals. OPS increased both the number and the size of the civil penalties it assessed against pipeline operators over the last 4 years (2000-2003) following its decision to be \"tough but fair\" in assessing penalties. OPS assessed an average of 22 penalties per year during this period, compared with an average of 14 per year for the previous 5 years (1995-1999), a period of more lenient \"partnering\" with industry. In addition, the average penalty increased from $18,000 to $29,000 over the two periods. About 94 percent of the 216 penalties levied from 1994 through 2003 have been paid. The civil penalty is one of several actions OPS can take when it finds a violation, and these penalties represent about 14 percent of all enforcement actions over the past 10 years. While OPS has increased the number and size of civil penalties, stakeholders--including industry, state, and insurance company officials and public advocacy groups--expressed differing views on whether these penalties deter noncompliance with safety regulations. Some, such as pipeline operators, thought that any penalty was a deterrent if it kept the pipeline operator in the public eye, while others, such as safety advocates, told us that the penalties were too small to be effective sanctions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We appreciate the opportunity to participate in this hearing on the  oversight of the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS). As you know, pipeline  transportation for hazardous liquids and natural gas is the safest form of  freight transportation, and OPS has taken many steps to make it safer.  However, the number of serious hazardous liquid accidents has stayed  about the same while the number of serious natural gas accidents has  increased. (See fig. 1.) Finally, the serious accident rate\u2014which considers  the amount of product and distance shipped\u2014for hazardous liquids has  decreased. None of these statistics show a constant pattern. In part, the  lack of significant change over time and the fluctuation over time may be  due to the relatively small number of serious accidents\u2014an average of  about 150 per year for both types combined.", "The accident rate is the number of serious accidents per billion ton-miles shipped. (A ton-mile is 1 ton  of a product shipped 1 mile.)", "The accident rates are based on the volume of petroleum products shipped. Federal agencies and  industry associations we contacted could not provide data on other hazardous liquids shipped.  Aggregated industry data on the amounts of products shipped through hazardous liquid pipelines for  2002 and 2003 are not available so we do not present accident rate information for those years. We  are inquiring into the availability of data on natural gas shipped through interstate pipelines; these  data are needed to calculate the accident rates for this type of pipeline.", "A cornerstone to OPS\u2019s efforts over the past several years has been the  agency\u2019s development and implementation of a risk-based approach that it  believes will fundamentally improve the safety of pipeline transportation.  This approach, called integrity management, requires interstate pipeline  operators to identify and fix safety-related threats to their pipelines in  areas where an accident could have the greatest consequences. OPS  believes that this approach has more potential to improve safety than its  traditional approach, which focused on enforcing compliance with safety  standards regardless of the threat to pipeline safety. Officials have  emphasized that integrity management, coupled with other initiatives,  such as oversight of operators\u2019 programs to qualify employees to operate  their pipelines, represents a systematic approach to overseeing and  improving pipeline safety that will change the safety culture of the  industry and drive down the number of accidents.", "Now that its integrity management approach and other initiatives are  substantially under way, OPS recognizes that it needs to turn its attention  to the management of its enforcement program. Accordingly, my  testimony today focuses on opportunities for improving certain aspects of  OPS\u2019s enforcement program that should be useful to OPS as it decides  how to proceed and to this committee as it continues to exercise  oversight.", "My statement is based on the preliminary results of our ongoing work for  this committee and others. As directed by the Pipeline Safety  Improvement Act of 2002, we have been (1) evaluating the effectiveness of  OPS\u2019s enforcement strategy and (2) examining OPS\u2019s assessment of  monetary sanctions (called civil penalties) against interstate pipeline  operators that violate federal pipeline safety rules. We expect to report on  the results of our work on these and other issues next month.", "Our work is based on our review of laws, regulations, program guidance,  and discussions with OPS officials and a broad range of stakeholders. To  evaluate the effectiveness of OPS\u2019s enforcement strategy, we determined  the extent to which the agency\u2019s strategy incorporates three key elements  of effective program management: clear program goals, a well-defined  strategy for achieving goals, and measures of performance that are linked  to program goals. We also examined how OPS assessed civil penalties  from 1994 through 2003 and the extent to which pipeline operators have  paid them. Finally, we interviewed stakeholders on whether OPS\u2019s civil  penalties help deter safety violations. As part of our work, we assessed  internal controls and the reliability of the data elements needed for this  engagement, and we determined that the data elements, with one  exception, were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We performed our  work in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.", "The effectiveness of OPS\u2019s enforcement strategy cannot be evaluated  because the agency has not incorporated three key elements of effective  program management\u2014clear program goals, a well-defined strategy for  achieving those goals, and measures of performance that are linked to the  program goals. Without these three key elements, OPS cannot determine  whether recent and planned changes in its enforcement strategy are  having or will have the desired effects on pipeline safety. Under a more  aggressive enforcement strategy (termed \u201ctough but fair\u201d) that OPS  initiated in 2000, the agency is using the full range of its enforcement tools,  rather than relying primarily as it did before on more lenient  administrative actions, such as warning letters. However, OPS has not  established goals that specify the intended results of this new strategy,  developed a policy that describes the strategy and the strategy\u2019s  contribution to pipeline safety, or put measures in place that would allow  OPS to determine and demonstrate the effects of this strategy on pipeline  safety. OPS is developing an enforcement policy that will help define its  enforcement strategy and has taken some initial steps toward identifying  new measures of enforcement performance. However, it does not  anticipate finalizing this policy until sometime in 2005 and has not adopted  key practices for achieving successful performance measurement systems,  such as linking measures to program goals.", "OPS increased both the number and the size of the civil penalties it  assessed in response to criticism that its enforcement activities were weak  and ineffective. For example, from 2000 through 2003, following its  decision to be tough but fair in assessing civil penalties, OPS assessed an  average of 22 penalties per year, compared with an average of 14 penalties  per year from 1995 through 1999, when OPS\u2019s policy was to \u201cpartner\u201d with  industry, rather than primarily to enforce compliance. In addition, from  2000 through 2003, OPS assessed an average civil penalty of about $29,000,  compared with an average of $18,000 from 1995 through 1999.  Departmental data show that operators have paid 94 percent (202 of 216)  of the civil penalties issued over the past 10 years. Civil penalties are one  of several enforcement actions that OPS can take to increase compliance  and represent about 14 percent of all enforcement actions taken over the  past 10 years. Although OPS has increased both the number and the size of  its civil penalties, it is not clear whether this action will help deter  noncompliance with the agency\u2019s safety regulations. The pipeline safety  stakeholders we spoke with expressed differing views on whether OPS\u2019s  civil penalties deter noncompliance with the pipeline safety regulations.  Some\u2014such as pipeline industry officials\u2014said that civil penalties of any  size act as a deterrent, in part because they keep companies in the public  eye.

The office attempts to ensure the safe operation of  pipelines through regulation, national consensus standards, research,  education (e.g., to prevent excavation-related damage), oversight of the  industry through inspections, and enforcement when safety problems are  found. The office uses a variety of enforcement tools, such as compliance  orders and corrective action orders that require pipeline operators to  correct safety violations, notices of amendment to remedy deficiencies in  operators\u2019 procedures, administrative actions to address minor safety  problems, and civil penalties. OPS is a small federal agency. In fiscal year  2003, OPS employed about 150 people, about half of whom were pipeline  inspectors.", "Before imposing a civil penalty on a pipeline operator, OPS issues a notice  of probable violation that documents the alleged violation and a notice of  proposed penalty that identifies the proposed civil penalty amount. Failure  by an operator to inspect the pipeline for leaks or unsafe conditions is an  example of a violation that may lead to a civil penalty. OPS then allows the  operator to present evidence either in writing or at an informal hearing.  Attorneys from RSPA\u2019s Office of Chief Counsel preside over these  hearings. Following the operator\u2019s presentation, the civil penalty may be  reaffirmed, reduced, or withdrawn. If the hearing officer determines that a  violation did occur, the Office of Chief Counsel issues a final order that  requires the operator to correct the safety violation (if a correction is  needed) and pay the penalty (called the \u201cassessed penalty\u201d). The operator  has 20 days after the final order is issued to pay the penalty. The Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA) collects civil penalties for OPS.", "From 1992 through 2002, federal law allowed OPS to assess up to $25,000  for each day a violation continued, not to exceed $500,000 for any related  series of violations.

In 2000, in response to concerns that its enforcement was weak and  ineffective, the agency decided to institute a \u201ctough but fair\u201d enforcement  approach and to make greater use of all its enforcement tools, including  larger and more frequent civil penalties. In 2001, to further strengthen its  enforcement, OPS began issuing more corrective action orders requiring  operators to address safety problems that led or could lead to pipeline  accidents. In 2002, OPS created a new Enforcement Office to focus more  on enforcement and help ensure consistency in enforcement decisions.  However, this new office is not yet fully staffed, and key positions remain  vacant.", "In 2002, OPS began to enforce its new integrity management and operator  qualification standards in addition to its minimum safety standards.  Initially, while operators were gaining experience with the new, complex  integrity management standards, OPS primarily used notices of  amendment, which require improvements in procedures, rather than  stronger enforcement actions. Now that operators have this experience,  OPS has begun to make greater use of civil penalties in enforcing these  standards.", "OPS has also recently begun to reengineer its enforcement program.  Efforts are under way to develop a new enforcement policy and  guidelines, develop a streamlined process for handling enforcement cases,  modernize and integrate the agency\u2019s inspection and enforcement  databases, and hire additional enforcement staff.

Intermediate outcomes show progress  toward achieving end outcomes.

The three  measures that OPS is considering could provide more information on the  intermediate outcomes of the agency\u2019s enforcement strategy, such as the  frequency of repeat violations and the number of repairs made in response  to corrective action orders, as well as other aspects of program  performance, such as the timeliness of enforcement actions.", "We have found that agencies that are successful in measuring performance  strive to establish measures that demonstrate results, address important  aspects of program performance, and provide useful information for  decision-making. While OPS\u2019s new measures may produce better  information on the performance of its enforcement program than is  currently available, OPS has not adopted key practices for achieving these  characteristics of successful performance measurement systems:    Measures should demonstrate results (outcomes) that are directly linked  to program goals. Measures of program results can be used to hold  agencies accountable for the performance of their programs and can  facilitate congressional oversight. If OPS does not set clear goals that  identify the desired results (intermediate outcomes) of enforcement, it  may not choose the most appropriate performance measures. OPS officials  acknowledge the importance of developing such goals and related  measures but emphasize that the diversity of pipeline operations and the  complexity of OPS\u2019s regulations make this a challenging task.", "Measures should address important aspects of program performance  and take priorities into account. An agency official told us that a key  factor in choosing final measures would be the availability of supporting  data. However, the most essential measures may require the development  of new data. For example, OPS has developed databases that will track the  status of safety issues identified in integrity management and operator  qualification inspections, but it cannot centrally track the status of safety  issues identified in enforcing its minimum safety standards. Agency  officials told us that they are considering how to add this capability as part  of an effort to modernize and integrate their inspection and enforcement  databases.", "Measures should provide useful information for decision-making,  including adjusting policies and priorities.

Civil penalties  represent about 14 percent (216 out of 1,530) of all enforcement actions  taken over the past 10 years. OPS makes more extensive use of other types  of enforcement actions that require pipeline operators to fix unsafe  conditions and improve inadequate procedures, among other things.

OPS may increase its  use of civil penalties as it begins to use them to a greater degree for  violations of its integrity management standards.", "The average size of the civil penalties has increased. For example, from  1995 through 1999, the average assessed civil penalty was about $18,000.  From 2000 through 2003, the average assessed civil penalty increased by  62 percent to about $29,000.

These  penalties were reduced by about 37 percent (from a total of $2.8 million to  $1.7 million). The dollar difference between the proposed and the assessed  penalties would be over three times as large had our analysis included the  extraordinarily large penalty for the Bellingham, Washington, incident. For  this case, OPS proposed a $3.05 million penalty and had assessed $250,000  as of May 2004. If we include this penalty, then over this period OPS  reduced total proposed penalties by about two-thirds, from about $5.8  million to about $2 million.", "OPS\u2019s database does not provide summary information on why penalties  are reduced. According to an OPS official, the agency reduces penalties  when an operator presents evidence that the OPS inspector\u2019s finding is  weak or wrong or when the pipeline\u2019s ownership changes during the  period between the proposed and assessed penalty. It was not practical for  us to gather information on a large number of penalties that were reduced,  but we did review several to determine the reasons for the reductions.  OPS reduced one of the civil penalties we reviewed because the operator  provided evidence that OPS inspectors had miscounted the number of  pipeline valves that OPS said the operator had not inspected.

However, some industry officials said that OPS\u2019s  enforcement actions are not their primary motivation for safety. Instead,  they said that pipeline operators are motivated to operate safely because  they need to avoid any type of accident, incident, or OPS enforcement  action that impedes the flow of products through the pipeline and hinders  their ability to provide good service to their customers. Pipeline industry  officials also said that they want to operate safely and avoid pipeline  accidents because accidents generate negative publicity and may result in  costly private litigation against the operator.", "Most of the interstate agents, representatives of their associations, and  insurance company officials expressed views similar to those of the  pipeline industry officials, saying that they believe civil penalties deter  operators\u2019 noncompliance with regulations to a certain extent.

Pipeline safety advocacy groups  that we talked to also said that the civil penalty amounts OPS imposes are  too small to have any deterrent effect on pipeline operators. As discussed  earlier, for 2000 through 2003, the average assessed penalty was about  $29,000.", "According to economic literature on deterrence, pipeline operators may be  deterred if they expect a sanction, such as a civil penalty, to exceed any  benefits of noncompliance. Such benefits could, in some cases, be lower  operating costs. The literature also recognizes that the negative  consequences of noncompliance\u2014such as those stemming from lawsuits,  bad publicity, and the value of the product lost from accidents\u2014can deter  noncompliance along with regulatory agency oversight. Thus, for example,  the expected costs of a legal settlement could overshadow the lower  operating costs expected from noncompliance, and noncompliance might  be deterred.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
