GAO found that 6 of the 38 contracts reviewed from the Departments of Defense (DOD), Health and Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security (DHS), and Veterans Affairs (VA) inaccurately recorded waiver or exception information. FPDS-NG system limitations compound these errors because it does not fully capture Buy American Act data.

In  three of the six contracts, agencies recorded the wrong exception or  waiver, most often because of an error when reporting the place of  manufacture in FPDS-NG. For example, DOD reported a $22,000  contract for vehicle equipment from South Africa as a Buy American Act  exception due to unreasonable cost.

For example,  DHS incorrectly recorded that an $18 million contract was for aircraft  accessories and other parts manufactured in the United States, even  though file documentation showed the contract was for Italian-produced  spare parts from the original equipment manufacturer. The Italian- produced spare parts were available from existing inventory maintained  by the manufacturer and were needed immediately to meet a mandatory  operational requirement.

Contracting officials corrected the data in FPDS-NG during the course  of our review. Further, FPDS-NG does not prevent agencies from  reporting trade agreement waivers when the contracts are valued  below applicable thresholds or waivers do not apply, such as for small  business set asides. For example, in the fiscal year 2017 data we  reviewed, more than 5 percent of contract obligations reported for  trade agreement waivers were for awards set-aside for small  businesses, which would not be eligible under the Trade Agreements  Act. OFPP officials noted that because of the various dollar thresholds  applicable to different trade agreements, adding automatic thresholds  in FPDS-NG to guide contracting staff in reporting an applicable trade  agreement could lead to additional data errors in the procurement  database.", "Awards under the Micro-purchase Threshold.

Instead,  contracting officers entering information for awards under the micro- purchase amount must still state whether the product is domestic or  foreign. If the product is foreign, the officials must select a Buy  American Act exception authorizing the purchase, even though no  exception is needed at these dollar levels. As a result, when agencies  report in FPDS-NG that a Buy American Act exception or waiver  applied for a procurement valued at less than $3,500, that information  would not be accurate. Based on our review, this may have involved  about $16 million in fiscal year 2017 obligations.", "Awards for both Foreign and Domestic Products. When reporting  data for contracts that include multiple end products from both the  United States and a foreign country, FPDS-NG only allows for one  country of origin to be identified. Contracting officers told us that they  typically will report a foreign end product in FPDS-NG when the  foreign products account for the preponderance of the contract value.  Thus, in cases where a contract includes foreign end products that do  not account for the preponderance of the contract\u2019s value, the value of  these foreign end products would not be reported in FPDS-NG. We  have previously reported that FPDS-NG has similar limitations in other  fields, such the type of product or service provided, which prevent  contracting officers from identifying more than one condition.  According to OFPP, a recent change in the FAR requiring contract  reporting at the line item level should provide greater transparency of  all products included in a contract.", "Buy American Act Exceptions and Waivers under Indefinite  Delivery Contracts. The way FPDS-NG captures data for Buy  American Act exceptions and waivers for some indefinite-delivery  contracts results in inaccurate data reporting. When an indefinite- delivery contract is initially awarded, FPDS-NG functionality does not  give contracting staff the option to enter information for the \u2018Place of  Manufacture\u2019 field. Instead, this information is typically captured once  an order is placed on the contract. In our review of FPDS-NG data  across the four agencies, however, we found that in some cases  obligations are reported on the initial indefinite delivery contract so the  Buy American Act exceptions or waivers are not recorded. This  occurred with multiple agencies, but particularly at HHS, where  information for almost 28 percent of HHS obligations for end products  in fiscal year 2017 was not captured in FPDS-NG because the  obligations were reported in the system through the initial contracts  rather than orders.

Specifically, DHS  updated its acquisition manual to provide contracting officers more explicit  FPDS-NG reporting instructions for procurements subject to the Buy  American Act, as well as discretion to purchase domestic end products at  or below the micro-purchase threshold. Additional changes include  increasing the documentation and level of managerial review required to  use several of the exceptions to the Buy American Act. For example, prior  to 2018\u2014which includes the time period in which the DHS contracts and  orders we reviewed were awarded\u2014the head of individual contracting  offices had the authority to approve domestic non-availability and  unreasonable cost exceptions, with a notification made to the DHS Chief  Procurement Officer.

The policy memorandum encourages the  HCAs within VA to institute reviews of awarded contracts subject to the  Buy American Act to ensure compliance. As of September 2018, policy  officials did not know how many HCAs had taken this step. Further, the  guidance emphasizes the importance of Buy American Act training for its  acquisition workforce. VA policy officials explained that the Buy American  Act is introduced in several VA training courses, but the agency does not  have a specific course on implementing the Buy American Act  requirements or provide additional instruction or tools. During the course  of our review, VA officials said that some of the HCAs had added internal  training on the Buy American Act.

Moreover, several contracting staff noted an increased need for  training due to recent changes in VA contracting practices. Specifically, in  response to a 2016 Supreme Court decision, VA has increased  contracting efforts with veteran-owned small businesses through the  Veterans First Contracting Program. As a result, contracting officials  explained they have reduced their use of schedule contracts, in which the  determinations related to the Buy American Act requirements were made  with the initial awards. As one contracting officer explained, prior to this  change, more than 90 percent of her division\u2019s procurements were  through VA schedule contracts in which Buy American Act applicability  had already been established. However, this shift in contracting practices  means contracting officers will more frequently need to consider the  applicability of the Buy American Act, but contracting officers have not  received specific guidance or training to do so. Noting the significance of  this change, one contracting officer stated she approached VA  management to obtain Buy American Act training for her division, but  such training was not available.", "Federal internal controls state that agencies should ensure that training is  aimed at developing and retaining employee knowledge, skills, and  abilities to meet changing organizational needs. In September 2018, we  reported that VA was experiencing difficulties implementing multiple  aspects of the Veterans First policy, and we recommended that VA  provide more targeted implementation training.

However,  available guidance does not always address these complexities. For  example, agencies need to decide if other conditions, such as the  procurement of products deemed indispensable for national security or  national defense purposes apply to an acquisition that would make a  trade agreement inapplicable.

Vendors  frequently certify this information through the System for Award  Management (SAM), the government-wide system used to collect  vendors\u2019 annual representations and certifications.", "Contracting officers may rely on the information vendors provide about  their product origins, but they are generally expected to take actions to  verify incomplete or conflicting information when they have reason to  believe that a vendor will be providing a non-compliant product.

In 6 of the 38  contracts that we reviewed\u2014from DHS, HHS, and VA\u2014the vendors  certified that they only provided domestic end products although the end  products provided were foreign. In all of these cases, the contracting  officers knew that the acquisitions included foreign end products. For  example, we reviewed two DHS awards for spare aircraft parts from an  Italian-based company, one of which was reported in FPDS-NG under the  domestic non-availability exception to the Buy American Act, and the  other which was incorrectly reported as being manufactured in the United  States but has since been corrected.
