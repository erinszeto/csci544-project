An estimated 40,000 people who responded to the disaster--including New York City Fire Department (FDNY) personnel and other government and private-sector workers and volunteers--were exposed to numerous physical and mental health hazards. Concerns remain about the long-term health effects of the attack and about the nation's capacity to plan for and respond to both short- and long-term health effects in the event of a future attack or other disaster. Several federally funded programs have monitored the physical and mental health effects of the WTC attack. These monitoring programs include one-time screening programs and programs that also conduct follow-up monitoring. GAO was asked to assess the progress of these programs. GAO examined (1) federally funded programs implemented by state and local government agencies or private institutions, (2) federally administered programs to monitor the health of federal workers who responded to the disaster in an official capacity, and (3) lessons learned from WTC monitoring programs. GAO reviewed program documents and interviewed federal, state, and local officials and others involved in WTC monitoring programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Three federally funded monitoring programs implemented by state and local governments or private organizations after the WTC attack have provided initial medical examinations--and in some cases follow-up examinations--to thousands of affected responders to screen for health problems. For example, the FDNY medical monitoring program completed initial screening for over 15,000 firefighters and emergency medical service personnel, and the worker and volunteer program screened over 14,000 other responders. The New York State responder screening program screened about 1,700 state responders before ending its examinations in 2003. Most state responders have not been informed that they are now eligible to participate in the worker and volunteer program, and New York State responders could miss the opportunity for continued monitoring. These monitoring programs and the WTC Health Registry have collected information that program officials believe researchers could use to help better understand the health consequences of the attack and improve treatment. Program officials expressed concern, however, that current federal funding arrangements for long-term monitoring may be too short to allow for identification of all future health effects. In contrast to the progress made by other federally funded programs, the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) program to screen federal workers who were sent by their agencies to respond to the WTC disaster has accomplished little and is on hold. The program--which started about one year later than other WTC monitoring programs--completed screening of 394 of the estimated 10,000 federal workers who responded in an official capacity to the disaster, but HHS officials suspended examinations and the program has not screened anyone since March 2004. The program's limited activity and the exclusion of federal workers from other monitoring programs because of the assumption that they could receive screening examinations through the HHS program may have resulted in many federal responders losing the opportunity to identify and seek treatment for their WTC-related health problems. Officials involved in WTC health monitoring programs cited lessons from their experiences that could help others who may be responsible for designing and implementing health monitoring efforts that follow other disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina. These include the need to quickly identify and contact people affected by a disaster; to monitor for mental health effects, as well as physical injuries and illnesses; and to anticipate when designing disaster-related monitoring efforts that there will likely be many people who require referrals for follow-up care and that handling the referral process may require substantial effort.

After the collapse of the WTC buildings, nearly 3,000  people died, and an estimated 250,000 to 400,000 people who lived,  worked, or attended school in the vicinity were affected. An estimated  40,000 people responded to the disaster, including New York City Fire  Department (FDNY) personnel and other government and private-sector  workers and volunteers from New York and other locations across the  nation. These responders, as they took part in various rescue, recovery,  and cleanup activities in the days, weeks, and months following the attack,  were exposed to numerous physical hazards and environmental toxins due  to the destruction caused by the attack. The magnitude and unprecedented  nature of this event also exposed responders and many other people to  considerable psychological trauma.", "Four years after the destruction of the WTC buildings, concerns remain  about the long-term physical and mental health effects of the attack.  Several recent studies of responders report that many of them have high  rates of physical and mental health symptoms, of which respiratory  problems are the most persistent physical effects. While the nature and  severity of a future terrorist attack cannot be predicted, our prior work on  the health effects of the WTC attack, the 2001 anthrax attacks, and  bioterrorism preparedness, as well as reports by other organizations,  highlight the importance of ensuring the nation\u2019s capacity to plan for and  respond to the short- and long-term health consequences likely to result in  the event of a future attack or other disaster, such as the destruction  recently caused by Hurricane Katrina.", "As we testified in September 2004, in the aftermath of the WTC attack, five  key federally funded programs were implemented to assess the short-term,  and in some cases long-term, effects on people\u2019s physical and mental  health. These programs include the FDNY WTC Medical Monitoring  Program, WTC Medical Monitoring Program (worker and volunteer  program), New York State responder screening program, WTC Health  Registry, and the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) WTC  Federal Responder Screening Program. You asked us to provide  information on the progress of these monitoring programs. My testimony  today will focus on (1) progress made by federally funded programs that  are implemented by state and local government agencies or private  organizations and were established to monitor the health of people in the  aftermath of the attack, (2) progress made by federally administered  programs established to monitor the health of federal workers who  responded to the disaster in an official capacity, and (3) lessons from WTC  monitoring programs that could assist those who may be responsible for  future disaster-related health monitoring efforts.", "To conduct this work, we obtained and reviewed program documents  dating from the beginning of the programs, including grantee progress  reports, budget documents, clinical protocols, health screening and other  assessment tools, and selected peer-reviewed articles based on  information collected by WTC monitoring programs. We also interviewed  federal, state, and local officials and others involved in administering WTC  monitoring programs, including officials from HHS and the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS); New York State Department of Health; New  York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene; and FDNY. Within  HHS, we interviewed officials from the Agency for Toxic Substances and  Disease Registry (ATSDR); the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention\u2019s (CDC) National Center for Environmental Health and  National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH); Federal  Occupational Health Services (FOH); and the Office of Public Health  Emergency Preparedness (OPHEP). We also obtained information from  the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Justice (DOJ).  We interviewed medical professionals affiliated with the New York  University School of Medicine, FDNY\u2019s Bureau of Health Services, Long  Island Occupational and Environmental Health Center, Mount Sinai-Irving  J. Selikoff Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Mount  Sinai School of Medicine Department of Psychiatry, and the University of  Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey\u2019s Robert Wood Johnson Medical  School. We relied on data provided by agency officials and contained in  government publications and did not independently verify the data we  obtained. In our judgment the reliability of the information we obtained  was adequate for our purposes. HHS and New York State officials  provided comments on the facts contained in this statement, and we made  changes as appropriate. We conducted our work from July 2005 through  September 2005 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.", "In summary, three federally funded programs implemented by state and  local governments or private organizations in the aftermath of the WTC  attack have provided initial medical examinations\u2014and in some cases  follow-up examinations\u2014to thousands of affected responders to screen  for health problems.

Physical health effects included injuries and respiratory  conditions, such as sinusitis, asthma, and a new syndrome called WTC  cough, which consists of persistent coughing accompanied by severe  respiratory symptoms. Almost all firefighters who responded to the attack  experienced respiratory effects, including WTC cough, and hundreds had  to end their firefighting careers due to WTC-related respiratory illnesses.  The most commonly reported mental health effects among responders and  others were symptoms associated with posttraumatic stress disorder\u2014an  often debilitating disorder that can develop after a person experiences or  witnesses a traumatic event, and which may not develop for months or  years after the event. Behavioral effects such as alcohol and tobacco use  and difficulty coping with daily responsibilities were also reported.", "Several federally funded programs monitor the health of people who were  exposed to the WTC attack and its aftermath. The monitoring programs  vary in such aspects as eligibility requirements, methods used for  collecting information about people\u2019s health, and approaches for offering  referrals. Of the four programs that offer medical examinations to WTC  responders, the only one that is open to federal workers who responded to  the disaster in an official capacity is the one implemented by HHS. (See  table 1.) None of the monitoring programs receives federal funds to  provide clinical treatment for health problems that are identified.", "The majority of federal funding for these monitoring programs was  provided by DHS\u2019s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as  part of the approximately $8.8 billion in federal assistance that the  Congress appropriated to FEMA for response and recovery activities after  the WTC disaster. One fiscal year 2003 appropriation specifically  authorized FEMA to use a portion of its WTC-related funding for screening  and long-term monitoring of emergency services and rescue and recovery  personnel. Generally, however, FEMA may fund only short-term care  after a disaster, such as emergency medical services, and not ongoing  clinical treatment.", "FEMA entered into interagency agreements with HHS to fund most of  these health monitoring programs. HHS is the designated lead agency for  the public health and medical support function under the National  Response Plan and is responsible for coordinating the medical resources  of all federal departments and agencies.

Current plans are to conduct a  total of three follow-up examinations for each participant by 2009. As part  of their federally funded activities, both programs provide referrals for  participants who require treatment. FDNY employees and retirees can  obtain treatment and counseling services from the FDNY Bureau of Health  Services and the FDNY Counseling Services Unit, or they can use their  health insurance to obtain treatment and counseling services elsewhere.

Officials sent letters to these responders to inform them about  the program and their eligibility for it. For each participant, the screening  included a health and exposure questionnaire and physical and pulmonary  examinations. Participants who required further evaluation or treatment  after screening were told to follow up with their personal physician or a  specialist. The program stopped screening participants in November 2003,  in part because the number of responders requesting examinations was  dwindling, and no follow-up examinations are planned.", "In February 2005, worker and volunteer program officials began to allow  New York State responders to participate in that monitoring program. The  officials determined that the worker and volunteer program would have  sufficient funding to accommodate state workers who want to join the  program. The state program has not notified the approximately 1,700  workers it has screened that they are now eligible for continued  monitoring from the worker and volunteer program. Program officials  relayed this development only to those state responders who inquired  about screening or monitoring examinations following the decision to  permit state responders to participate in the worker and volunteer  program. Worker and volunteer program officials told us that, through  August 2005, no state workers who responded to the WTC disaster in an  official capacity had received examinations from the worker and volunteer  program. According to worker and volunteer program officials, any state  worker screened by the state program would need a new baseline  examination through the worker and volunteer program because the  screening data collected by the state program differ from the data  collected in the worker and volunteer program.

They  said that potential monitoring program participants can become more  difficult to locate as time passes. In addition, potential participants\u2019  ability to recall the events of a disaster may decrease over time, making it  more difficult to collect accurate information about their experiences and  health. However, the time it takes to design, fund, approve, and implement  monitoring programs can lead to delays in contacting the people who were  affected. For example, the WTC Health Registry received funding in July  2002 but did not begin collecting data until September 2003\u20142 years after  the disaster. From July 2002 through September 2003, the program\u2019s  activities included developing the registry protocol, testing the  questionnaire, and obtaining approval from institutional review boards and  the federal Office of Management and Budget. This delayed the collection  of information from participants. To prevent similar delays during the  response to future disasters, ATSDR officials are developing a  questionnaire, known as the Rapid Response Registry, to allow officials to  identify and locate potentially affected individuals immediately after a  disaster and collect basic preliminary information, such as their current  contact information and their location during the disaster. ATSDR  officials expect that using this instrument would reduce delays in  collecting time-sensitive information while officials take the time  necessary to develop a monitoring program for disaster-related health  effects.", "Furthermore, officials told us that health monitoring for future disasters  could benefit from additional centrally coordinated planning. Such  planning could facilitate the collection of compatible data among  monitoring efforts, to the extent that this is appropriate. Collecting  compatible data could allow information from different programs to be  integrated and contribute to improved data analysis and more useful  research. In addition, centrally coordinated planning could help officials  determine whether separate programs are necessary to serve different  groups of people. For example, worker and volunteer program officials  indicated that it might have been possible for that program to serve federal  workers who responded to the disaster in an official capacity, which might  have eliminated the need to organize and administer a separate program  for them.", "Officials also stated that screening and monitoring programs should be  comprehensive, encompassing both physical and mental health  evaluations. Worker and volunteer medical monitoring program officials  told us that the initial planning for the program had focused primarily on  screening participants\u2019 physical health, and that they did not originally  budget for extensive mental health screening. Subsequently, they  recognized a need for more extensive mental health screening, including  greater participation of mental health professionals, but the program\u2019s  federal funding was not sufficient to cover such screening. By  collaborating with the Mount Sinai School of Medicine Department of  Psychiatry, program officials were able to obtain philanthropic funding to  develop a more comprehensive mental health questionnaire, provide on- site psychiatric screening, and, when necessary, provide more extensive  evaluations.", "Many participants in the monitoring programs required additional testing  or needed treatment for health problems that were identified during  screening examinations. Officials told us that finding treatment sources for  such participants is an important, but challenging, part of the programs\u2019  responsibility. For example, officials from the worker and volunteer  program stated that identifying providers available to treat participants  became a major part of their operations, and was especially difficult when  participants lacked health insurance. The officials said that planning for  future monitoring programs should include a determination of how best to  help participants obtain needed treatment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Federally funded programs implemented by state and local governments  or private organizations to monitor the health effects of the WTC attack on  thousands of people who responded to the disaster have made progress.  However, the program HHS established to screen the federal employees  whose agencies sent them to the WTC after the attack has accomplished  little, completing screenings of fewer than 400 of the thousands of federal  responders. Moreover, no examinations have occurred for over a year.  Because of this program\u2019s limited activity, and the inability of federal  workers to participate in other monitoring programs because of the  assumption that they would have the opportunity to receive screening  examinations through the HHS program, many federal responders may not  have had an opportunity to identify and seek treatment for health  problems related to the WTC disaster. For state responders, the  opportunity for continued monitoring could be lost if they are not  informed that they are now eligible to participate in the worker and  volunteer program.", "Based on their experiences, officials involved in the monitoring programs  have made a number of useful observations that will apply to future  terrorist attacks and natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina. For  example, screening for mental as well as physical health problems in New  Orleans and along the Gulf Coast will be critical to the recovery of  survivors of Hurricane Katrina and the responders to the disaster. The  federal, state, and local government officials who are responsible for  planning and implementing health monitoring activities in the aftermath of  disasters could improve their effectiveness by incorporating the lessons  learned from the World Trade Center experience.", "Mr. Chairman, this completes my prepared remarks.
