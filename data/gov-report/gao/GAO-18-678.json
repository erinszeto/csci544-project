We selected this period so we could  identify and obtain insight on historical data trends regarding aircraft  availability and O&S costs for the selected fixed-wing aircraft. We  compared the availability data over this period to Air Force and Navy availability goals associated with each aircraft fleet. To select the fixed- wing aircraft for our review, we considered a number of factors, such as  the type of aircraft (fighters, bombers, cargo, etc.), the size and age of the  inventory, and whether the aircraft were sustained organically by DOD or  through contract arrangements, such as public-private partnerships or  performance-based logistics contracts. For the Air Force, we selected  five fixed-wing aircraft\u2014the B-52 Stratofortress, C-17 Globemaster III, F- 16 Fighting Falcon, F-22 Raptor, and E-8C Joint Surveillance and Target  Attack Radar System (JSTARS).

For the selected aircraft, we obtained and reviewed the aircraft  availability, sustainment, and O&S data for accuracy and completeness,  interviewed officials regarding their data-collection processes, and  reviewed available related policies and procedures associated with the  collection of the data.

We also reviewed ongoing and  planned actions to address those challenges. We interviewed program  officials, depot officials, field maintainers, and squadrons to obtain their  views on the challenges they face in sustaining the aircraft and the  actions they take to mitigate those challenges. In some instances, we  visited depots and squadrons to observe aircraft undergoing  maintenance, discuss the respective maintenance processes, and  discuss challenges and mitigation actions with officials.", "For objective three, we obtained and analyzed the sustainment strategies,  performance management frameworks (i.e., sustainment metrics  collected and monitored as well as the levels of management review), and improvement plans for each of the 12 selected fixed-wing aircraft.

To address  maintenance challenges, program offices for the selected aircraft  have improved the efficiency and speed of depot maintenance, as  well as are working to ensure there are sufficient numbers of trained  maintainers.", "Supply Support: Some aircraft are encountering supply shortages as  a result of parts not being available, in some cases due to  obsolescence issues or diminishing manufacturer sources.  Overcoming part shortages through either searching for replacement  parts or reengineering parts takes time, which can contribute to  aircraft being unavailable for longer periods. To mitigate supply  challenges, officials have proactively upgraded aircraft before  obsolescence occurs or located available parts and reengineered  parts that are no longer in production, as well as identified suitable  manufacturers in advance, among other things.", "For more specific information on sustainment challenges related to aging  aircraft, maintenance, and supply support for each of the fixed-wing  aircraft, see the \u201cSustainment Quick Looks\u201d in appendixes II\u2013XIII."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sustainment Strategies Were Documented for Some but Not All Aircraft, and the Air Force and Navy Have Other Efforts to Review and Improve Aircraft Availability", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force has documented sustainment strategies for its five selected  aircraft in our review, but the Navy has not documented sustainment  strategies or updated the strategies for four of seven of its aircraft in our  review.

For the E-2C and F/A-18A-D, Naval Air Systems Command  officials and program office officials told us that they were not required to  document sustainment strategies because these aircraft were legacy  systems at the time the requirement to develop and maintain a  sustainment strategy was implemented. Therefore, according to these  officials, the DOD requirements to document and update sustainment  strategies every 5 years in DOD Instruction 5000.02 were not applicable.", "DOD Instruction 5000.02 requires weapon systems to have some form of  a sustainment strategy that is not older than 5 years; however, it is  unclear whether this policy is applicable to legacy weapon systems.  Specifically, the policy states that program managers for all programs are  responsible for developing and maintaining a sustainment strategy, such  as a Life-cycle Sustainment Plan, beginning at the risk-reduction decision  point (i.e., Milestone A of the acquisition process). However, based on  our discussions with Navy program officials for our selected aircraft and  our review of the policy, it is unclear whether the policy\u2014as currently  written\u2014is applicable to legacy systems that were no longer in production  and thus had completed the risk-reduction decision point (or Milestone A)  prior to the requirement to update a sustainment strategy every 5 years.

Air Force officials told us that they did this  because the DOD policy was unclear whether it was applicable to legacy  systems and it was a good practice to ensure the guidance was explicit  for all weapon systems to document and update a sustainment strategy.  This instruction explicitly states that the requirement to document a  sustainment strategy and update it every 5 years is applicable to all  weapon systems, including legacy systems that are in the O&S phase of  their life cycles. Additionally, the Air Force Instruction states that these  legacy systems are not required to retroactively meet requirements  identified for previous phases of the acquisition life-cycle, but should meet  the requirements needed for continued operations of the system.", "However, the Navy has not made the requirement explicit for legacy  systems in its guidance. Specifically, Navy guidance does not explicitly  state that documenting a sustainment strategy and updating that strategy  every 5 years is a requirement for legacy systems. While Navy guidance  requires the development and use of sustainment metrics for legacy  systems and requires the Naval Air Systems Command be responsible  for aviation weapon systems in sustainment, the Navy does not address  any requirement for sustainment strategies for legacy systems.", "The lack of clarity in DOD Instruction 5000.02 and the Navy guidance  regarding whether legacy systems are required to document a  sustainment strategy and update that strategy every 5 years has resulted  in confusion regarding sustainment planning requirements among Navy  program offices and could cause confusion with other weapon system  program offices across DOD. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government state that management should define objectives in specific  terms so they are understood at all levels of the entity. The standards  also state that guidance should clearly define what is to be achieved, who  is to achieve it, how it will be achieved, and the time frames for  achievement. As indicated by the Air Force\u2019s 2017 update to its  sustainment guidance, clarifying DOD and Navy guidance and the  applicability of sustainment strategy requirements to legacy systems  could be done through very small additions and clarifications to the  applicable guidance documents. Until DOD and the Navy update or issue  new guidance clarifying the requirements for documenting sustainment  strategies for legacy systems, weapon system program offices, such as  those for fixed-wing aircraft, as well as Naval Air Systems Command and DOD may not have full visibility of necessary requirements to achieve  program objectives or any related risks associated with the sustainment  of these weapon systems.", "While the DOD policy and Navy guidance is unclear, Naval Air Systems  Command and Navy program offices for the four aircraft\u2014C-2A, E-2C,  EA-18G, and F/A-18A-D\u2014that either do not have a sustainment strategy  or have not updated the strategy within the last 5 years are taking actions  to document or update the sustainment strategies for these aircraft.
