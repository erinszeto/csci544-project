However, HUD could further improve efforts in the following areas:", "Lead grant programs. While its recent grant award processes incorporate statutory requirements on applicant eligibility and selection criteria, HUD has not fully documented or evaluated these processes. For example, HUD\u2019s guidance is not sufficiently detailed to ensure consistent and appropriate grant award decisions. Better documentation and evaluation of HUD\u2019s grant program processes could help ensure that lead grants reach areas at risk of lead paint hazards. Further, HUD has not developed specific time frames for using available local-level data to better identify areas of the country at risk for lead paint hazards, which could help HUD target its limited resources.", "Oversight. HUD does not have a plan to mitigate and address risks related to noncompliance with lead paint regulations by public housing agencies. We identified several limitations with HUD\u2019s monitoring efforts, including reliance on public housing agencies\u2019 self-certifying compliance with lead paint regulations and challenges identifying children with elevated blood lead levels. Additionally, HUD lacks detailed procedures for addressing noncompliance consistently and in a timely manner. Developing a plan and detailed procedures to address noncompliance with lead paint regulations could strengthen HUD\u2019s oversight of public housing agencies.", "Inspections. The lead inspection standard for the Housing Choice Voucher program is less strict than that of the public housing program. By requesting and obtaining statutory authority to amend the standard for the voucher program, HUD would be positioned to take steps to better protect children in voucher units from lead exposure as indicated by analysis of benefits and costs.", "Performance assessment and reporting. HUD lacks comprehensive goals and performance measures for its lead reduction efforts.

According to CDC, no safe  level of lead in the blood has been identified. When absorbed into the  body, especially in young children, lead can damage the brain and  nervous system, slow development and growth, and cause learning or  behavioral problems. According to CDC, lead-based paint hazards, such  as dust containing lead and chips from deteriorated lead-based paint, are  the most common source of lead exposure for U.S. children. Young  children are at greater risk of being exposed to lead because they often  crawl on the floor, have frequent hand-to-mouth activity, and intentionally  ingest nonfood items. Also, exposure to lead impacts young children  more because of their small body size and weight compared to adults.", "The Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s (HUD) most  recent survey of housing conditions estimated that roughly 35 percent of  U.S. homes (37 million) contained some lead-based paint.

For example, we reviewed HUD\u2019s annual notices of funding  availability to identify the criteria HUD has used to evaluate grant  applications and determine the extent to which the 2017 notices  incorporated statutory requirements. We also compared HUD\u2019s lead grant  program processes to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  requirements for competitively awarded grants. To review the extent to  which grant awards have gone to counties with indicators of lead paint  hazard risk, we analyzed HUD\u2019s grant data from 2013 through 2017 and  county-level U.S. Census Bureau data on the age of housing and poverty  level of individuals in the United States. HUD\u2019s grant data were not  available electronically before 2013, when the agency started using  grants management software. We determined the HUD and Census data  were sufficiently reliable for our purposes\u2013\u2013to identify the locations and  grant award amounts for HUD grantees and to identify counties with older  housing and individuals living in poverty. Additionally, we interviewed  HUD staff about the agency\u2019s grant application and award processes. To  obtain information and perspectives from HUD grantees, we also  reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 20 grant applications and  interviewed 10 of the 20 grantees.

CDC  sets a health guideline known as the \u201cblood lead reference value\u201d to  identify children exposed to more lead than most other children. As of  2012, CDC began using a blood lead reference value of 5 micrograms of  lead per deciliter of blood. For children whose blood lead level is at or  above CDC\u2019s blood lead reference value, health care providers and public  health agencies can identify those children who may benefit the most  from early intervention. CDC\u2019s blood lead reference value is based on the  97.5th percentile of the blood lead distribution in U.S. children (ages 1 to  5), using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination  Survey.

In 1996, HUD and EPA jointly issued the  Lead Disclosure Rule. The rule applies to most housing built before  1978 and requires sellers and lessors to disclose any known  information, available records, and reports on the presence of lead  paint and lead paint hazards and provide an EPA-approved  information pamphlet prior to sale or lease.", "Lead Safe Housing Rule. In 1999, HUD first issued the Lead Safe  Housing Rule, which applies only to housing receiving federal  assistance or federally-owned housing being sold. The rule  established procedures for evaluating whether a lead paint hazard  exists, controlling or eliminating the hazard, and notifying occupants of  any lead paint hazards identified and related remediation efforts. The  rule established an \u201celevated blood lead level\u201d as a threshold that  requires landlords and PHAs to take certain actions if a child\u2019s blood  test shows lead levels meeting or exceeding this threshold. In 2017,  HUD amended the rule to align its definition of an \u201celevated blood lead  level\u201d with CDC\u2019s blood lead reference value. This change lowered  the threshold that generally required landlords and PHAs to act from  20 micrograms to 5 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood.  According to the rule, when a child under age 6 living in HUD-assisted  housing has an elevated blood lead level, the housing provider must  take several steps.

PHAs receive several streams of funding  from HUD to help make up the difference between what tenants pay  in rent and what it costs to maintain public housing. For example,  PHAs receive operating and capital funds through a formula allocation  process. PHAs use operating funds to pay for management,  administration, and day-to-day costs of running a housing  development. Capital funds are used for modernization needs, such  as replacing roofs or remediating lead paint hazards.

Through a merit-review process, an agency establishes and applies  criteria to evaluate the merit of competitive grant applications. Such a  process helps to ensure that the agency reviews grant applications in a  fair, competitive, and transparent manner. Consistent with the OMB  requirement to establish a merit review process, HUD has issued annual  funding notices that communicate clear and explicit evaluative criteria. In  addition, HUD has established processes for reviewing and scoring grant  applications using these evaluative criteria, and selects grant recipients  based on the review scores (see fig. 2). For example, applicants that  score at or above 75 points are qualified to receive awards from HUD.  Also, HUD awards funds beginning with the highest scoring applicant and  proceeds by awarding funds to applicants in a descending order until  funds are exhausted.

In its written comments, HUD said  that before deciding whether to request the statutory authority to  implement risk assessments for voucher units, it would need to conduct  and evaluate the results of a statistically rigorous study on the impacts of  requiring a lead risk assessment versus a visual assessment, such as the  impact on leasing times and the availability of housing for low-income  families. HUD further noted that such a study could explore whether  alternative options to the full risk assessment standard (such as targeted  dust sampling) could achieve similar levels of protection for children in the  voucher program. We note that requesting and obtaining authority to  amend the standard for the Housing Choice Voucher program would not  preclude HUD from doing such a study. We acknowledge that the results  of such a study might support a range of options. Therefore, we revised  our recommendation to provide HUD with greater flexibility in how it might  amend the lead inspection standard for the voucher program based on  consideration of not only leasing time and availability of housing, as HUD  emphasized in its written comments, but also based on the health effects  on children. The need for HUD to review the lead inspection standard for  the voucher program is underscored by the greater number of households  with children served by the voucher program compared to public housing,  as well as recent information indicating that more children with elevated  blood lead levels are living in voucher units than in public housing.", "HUD generally agreed with our remaining eight recommendations and  provided specific information about planned steps and other  considerations related to implementing them.

While these recommendations  had already recognized the need for the Lead Office to collaborate with  PIH, we reworded them to clarify that it is not necessary for the Lead  Office to have primary responsibility for their implementation.", "HUD generally agreed with our seventh and eighth recommendations, but  noted some considerations for implementing them. For our seventh  recommendation about performance goals and measures, HUD noted  that it will re-examine the availability of information from the current  housing databases to determine whether data on housing unit production  can be added to the existing data collected. HUD noted if that information  is not sufficient, it would need to obtain Office of Management and Budget  approval and have sufficient funds for such an information technology  project. For our eighth recommendation about evaluating the Lead Safe  Housing and Lead Disclosure Rules, HUD noted if its own resources are  insufficient, the time frame for implementing this recommendation may  depend on the availability of funding for contracted resources. Finally, in  response to our ninth recommendation, HUD said that it will draft and  submit annual and biennial reports to the congressional authorizing and  appropriations committees and then post the reports on the Lead Office\u2019s  public website.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban  Development, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency,  and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and other interested  parties.

Title X requires each grant recipient to make  matching contributions with state, local, and private funds (i.e.,  nonfederal) toward the total cost of activities. For the Lead-Based Paint  Hazard Control grant and the Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration  grant programs, the matching contribution has been set at no less than 10  percent and 25 percent, respectively, of the total grant amount. For  example, if the total grant amount is $3 million, then state or local  jurisdictions must provide at least $300,000 and $750,000, respectively,  for each grant program, in additional funding toward the cost of activities.  HUD requires lead grant applicants to include information on the sources  and amounts of grantees\u2019 matching contributions as part of their grant  applications. Additionally, Title X requires HUD to award grants in part  based on an applicant\u2019s ability to leverage state, local, and private funds  to supplement the federal grant funds.", "To identify the nonfederal funding sources grantees used in the lead  hazard control grants, we selected and reviewed the lead grant  applications of 20 HUD grantees and interviewed representatives from 10 of these. We selected these grantees based on their geographic  locations; the number of HUD lead grants they had previously received;  experience with HUD\u2019s lead hazard control grants; and whether they have  received both grants from 2013 through 2017. Grantees we selected  included entities at the state, municipality, and county levels. Information  from our grant application reviews and interviews of grantees cannot be  generalized to all HUD grantees.", "Based on our review of the selected grant applications and interviews of  selected grantees, we found that grantees planned to use the following  types of nonfederal funding sources as their matching contributions to  support their lead grants activities:", "State and local funds. Eighteen of the 20 grantees we selected  noted that they planned to use state or local funding sources to  supplement HUD\u2019s grant funds. The state and local funding sources  included state or local general funds and local property taxes or fees.  For example, grantees in Connecticut, Baltimore, and Philadelphia  used state or local general funds to cover personnel and operating  costs. Additionally, grantees in Alameda County (California),  Hennepin County (Minnesota), Malden, St. Louis, and Winnebago  County (Illinois) planned to use local taxes, including property taxes or  fees, such as real estate recording and building permit fees, to cover  some costs associated with their lead hazard control grants activities.", "Community Development Block Grant funds. Ten of the 20  grantees we selected indicated that they planned to use Community  Development Block Grant (CDBG) program funds to cover part of the  costs of their lead hazard control grants. CDBG program funds can  be used by states and local communities for housing; economic  development; neighborhood revitalization; and other community  development activities. For example, grantees in Baltimore and  Memphis noted in their grant applications that they planned to use the  funds to cover costs related to personnel, operations, and training.", "Nongovernmental contributions or discounts. Eight of 20 grantees  we selected stated that they anticipated some forms of  nongovernmental contributions from nonprofit organizations or  discounts from contractors to supplement the lead grants. For  example, all eight grantees stated that they expected to receive  matching contributions from nonprofit organizations.", "Table 2 summarizes the nonfederal funds by source that the 20 selected  grantees planned to use, based on our review of these grantees\u2019  applications.", "Furthermore, almost all of the selected grantees stated in their grant  applications or told us that they expected to receive or have received  other nonfederal funds in excess of their matching contributions. For  example, 15 grantees stated that they generally required or encouraged  property owners or landlords to contribute toward the lead hazard  remediation costs. Also, grantees in Baltimore, District of Columbia,  Lewiston, and Providence indicated that they expected to receive  monetary or in-kind donations from organizations to help carry out lead  hazard remediation, blood lead-level testing, or training. Additionally, the  grantee in Alameda County (California) told us that they have received  nonfederal funds from a litigation settlement with a private paint  manufacturer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["This report examines the Department of Housing and Urban  Development\u2019s (HUD) efforts to (1) incorporate statutory requirements  and other relevant federal standards in its lead grant programs; (2)  monitor and enforce compliance with lead paint regulations for its rental  assistance programs; (3) adopt federal health guidelines and  environmental standards for lead hazards in its lead grant and rental  assistance programs; and (4) measure and report on its performance  related to making housing lead-safe.", "In this report, we examine lead paint hazards in housing, and we focus on  HUD\u2019s lead hazard control grant programs and its two largest rental  assistance programs that serve the most families with children: the  Housing Choice Voucher (voucher) and public housing programs.", "To address all four objectives, we reviewed relevant laws, such as the  Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act (Title X of the  Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, referred to as Title X  throughout this appendix) and relevant HUD regulations, such as the  Lead Safe Housing Rule and a January 2017 amendment to this rule. To  examine trends in funding for HUD\u2019s lead grant programs for the past 10  years, we also reviewed HUD\u2019s budget information for fiscal years 2008  through 2017. We interviewed HUD staff from the Office of Lead Hazard  Control and Healthy Homes (Lead Office), Office of Public and Indian  Housing (PIH), Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R), and  other relevant HUD program and field offices. Finally, we reviewed our  prior work and those of HUD\u2019s Office of Inspector General.", "To address the first objective, we reviewed HUD\u2019s Notices of Funding  Availability (funding notices), policies, and procedures to identify HUD\u2019s  grant award processes for the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control grant  and Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration grant programs. For example,  we reviewed HUD\u2019s annual notices of funding availability from 2013  through 2017 to identify HUD\u2019s scoring factors for evaluating grant  applications. We compared HUD\u2019s grant award processes in 2017 with  Title X statutory requirements, the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) requirements for awarding federal grants, and relevant federal  internal control standards. We also interviewed HUD staff about the  agency\u2019s grant application review and award processes.", "To determine the extent to which HUD\u2019s grants have gone to counties in  the United States potentially at high risk for lead paint hazards, we  compared grantee locations from HUD\u2019s lead grant data for grants  awarded from 2013 through 2017 with county-level data on two indicators  of lead paint hazard risk from the 2011\u20132015 American Community  Survey\u2014a continuous survey of households conducted by the U.S.  Census Bureau. We analyzed HUD\u2019s grant data to determine the number  and dollar amount of grants received by each grantee, and the grantees\u2019  addresses. We then conducted a geographic analysis to determine  whether each HUD lead grant went to a county that met at least one,  both, or neither of the two commonly known indicators of lead paint  hazard risk\u2014the age of housing and poverty level. We identified these  two indicators through a review of relevant academic literature, agency  research, and state lead modelling methodologies.", "We used data from the 2011\u20132015 American Community Survey because  the data covered a time frame that best aligned with the 5 years of lead  grant data (2013 through 2017). Using its county-level data, we calculated  an estimated average percentage nationwide of housing units built before  1980 (56.9 percent) and an estimated average percentage nationwide of  individuals living below the poverty level (17.5 percent). We used 1980 as  a benchmark for age of housing because the American Community  Survey data for age of housing is separated by the decade of construction  and 1980 was closest in time to the 1978 federal lead paint ban. We  categorized counties based on whether their levels of pre-1980 housing  and poverty were above one, both, or neither of the respective national  average percentage for each indicator. The estimated average  nationwide and county-level percentages of the two indicators (e.g., older  housing and poverty rate) are expressed as a range of values. For the  lower and upper ends of the range, we generated a 95 percent  confidence interval that was within plus or minus 20 percentage points.", "We classified a county as above the estimated average percentages  nationwide if the county\u2019s confidence interval was higher and did not  overlap with the nationwide estimate\u2019s confidence interval. We omitted  the data for 12 counties that we determined were unreliable for our  purposes. We analyzed data starting in 2013 because that was the first  year for which these grant data were available electronically. We also  interviewed HUD staff to understand their efforts and plans to perform  similar analyses using indicators of lead paint hazard risk. To assess the  reliability of HUD\u2019s grant data, we reviewed documentation of HUD\u2019s  grant database, interviewed Lead Office staff on the processes HUD used  to collect and ensure the reliability of the data, and tested the data for  missing values, outliers, and obvious errors. To assess the reliability of  the American Community Survey data, we reviewed statistical information  from the Census Bureau and other publicly available documentation on  the survey and conducted electronic testing of the data. We determined  that the HUD grant data and American Community Survey county-level  data on age of housing and poverty were sufficiently reliable for  identifying areas at risk of lead paint hazards and determining the extent  to which lead grants from 2013 through 2017 have gone to at-risk areas.", "Furthermore, to obtain information about how HUD works with grantees to  achieve program objectives, we conducted in-person site visits to five  grantees located in five localities (Alameda County, California; Atlanta,  Georgia; Baltimore, Maryland; District of Columbia; and San Francisco,  California); and interviewed an additional five grantees on the telephone  (Hennepin County, Minnesota; Lewiston, Maine; Malden, Massachusetts;  Providence, Rhode Island; and Winnebago County, Illinois). In addition,  we reviewed the grant applications of the 10 grantees we spoke to and an  additional 10 grantees from 10 additional jurisdictions (State of  Connecticut; Cuyahoga County, Ohio; Denver, Colorado; Monroe County,  New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Memphis, Tennessee; San  Antonio, Texas; St. Louis, Missouri; Tucson, Arizona; and State of  Vermont).", "We selected the 10 grantees for site visits or interviews based on the  following criteria: geographic variation, number of years the grantees had  HUD\u2019s lead grants, and grantees that have received both types of lead  grants from 2013 through 2017. We selected the 10 additional grantees\u2019  applications for review based on geographic diversity and to achieve a  total of two applications for each year during our 5-year time frame, with  at least one application from each of the two HUD lead grant programs.  As part of our review of selected grant applications, we identified  nonfederal funding sources used by grantees, such as local tax revenues,  contractor discounts, and property owner contributions. Information from  the selected grantees and grant applications review cannot be  generalized to those grantees we did not include in our review.  Additionally, we interviewed representatives from housing organizations  to obtain additional examples of any nonfederal funding sources, such as  state or local bond measures, or low-interest loans to homeowners.", "To address the second objective, we also reviewed HUD guidance and  internal memorandums related to its efforts to monitor and enforce  compliance with lead paint regulations for public housing agencies (PHA),  the entities that manage HUD\u2019s voucher and public housing rental  assistance programs. In addition, we reviewed HUD\u2019s documentation of  databases it uses to monitor compliance, including the Lead-Based Paint  Response Tracker and the Elevated Blood Lead Level Tracker, and  observed HUD staff\u2019s demonstrations of these databases. HUD staff also  provided a demonstration of the Record and Process Inspection Data  database (known as \u201cRAPID\u201d) used by HUD\u2019s Real Estate Assessment  Center to collect physical inspection data for public housing units. We  obtained and reviewed information from HUD about instances of potential  noncompliance with lead paint regulations by PHAs as of November 2017  and enforcement actions HUD has taken. We compared HUD\u2019s regulatory  compliance monitoring and enforcement approach to federal internal  control standards. We interviewed staff from HUD\u2019s Lead Office, Office  of General Counsel, Office of Field Operations, and field staff, including  four HUD regional directors in areas of the country known to have a high  prevalence of lead paint hazards, about internal procedures for  monitoring and enforcing compliance with lead paint regulations by the  PHAs within their respective regions.", "To address the third objective on HUD\u2019s adoption of federal health  guidelines and environmental standards for lead paint hazards in its lead  grant and rental assistance programs, we reviewed relevant rules and  HUD documentation. To identify relevant federal health guidelines and  environmental standards, we reviewed guidelines and regulations from  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and interviewed staff from each  agency. To identify state and local laws with different requirements than  these federal guidelines and standards, we obtained information from and  interviewed staff from CDC\u2019s Public Health Law Program and the National  Conference of State Legislatures. We compared HUD\u2019s requirements to  CDC\u2019s health guideline known as the \u201cblood lead reference value\u201d and  EPA\u2019s standards for lead-based paint hazards and lead-dust clearance  standards. Finally, we reviewed information in HUD\u2019s 2017 funding  notices and lead grant programs\u2019 policy guidance about requirements for  grantees as they pertain to health guidelines and environmental  standards. We also interviewed HUD staff about how HUD has used the  findings from lead technical study grants to consider changes to HUD\u2019s  requirements and processes regarding identifying and addressing lead  paint hazards for the grant programs.", "To address the fourth objective, we reviewed HUD documentation related  to performance goals and measures, program evaluations, and reporting.  For example, we reviewed HUD\u2019s recent annual performance reports to  identify goals and performance measures related to HUD\u2019s efforts to  make housing lead-safe. Further, we reviewed Title X to identify  requirements related to evaluating and reporting on HUD\u2019s lead efforts.  We reviewed program evaluations and related studies completed by  outside experts for the lead grant programs and interviewed staff from  one of the organizations that conducted the evaluations. In addition, we  interviewed Lead Office and PD&R staff about the agency\u2019s plans to  evaluate the requirements in the Lead Safe Housing Rule and reviewed  corresponding agency documentation about these plans. Additionally,  we reviewed the Lead Office\u2019s most recent strategic plan (2009) and  annual report (1997) on the agency\u2019s lead efforts. We compared HUD\u2019s  use of performance goals and measures, program evaluations, and  reporting against leading practices for assessing program performance  and federal internal control standards. Finally, we interviewed staff from  HUD to understand goals and performance measures used by the agency  to assess their lead efforts.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2017 to June 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
