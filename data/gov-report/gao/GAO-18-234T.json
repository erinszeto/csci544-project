These included project complexity, the lack of an established project  release schedule, or that the project was not a software development  project.", "Further, in conducting an in-depth review of seven selected agencies\u2019  software development projects, we determined that 45 percent of the  projects delivered functionality every 6 months for fiscal year 2015 and 55  percent planned to do so in fiscal year 2016. However, significant  differences existed between the delivery rates that the agencies reported  to us and what they reported on the Dashboard. For example, for four  agencies (the Departments of Commerce, Education, Health and Human  Services, and Treasury), the percentage of delivery reported to us was at  least 10 percentage points lower than what was reported on the  Dashboard. These differences were due to (1) our identification of fewer  software development projects than agencies reported on the Dashboard  and (2) the fact that information reported to us was generally more current  than the information reported on the Dashboard.", "We concluded that, by not having up-to-date information on the  Dashboard about whether the project is a software development project  and about the extent to which projects are delivering functionality, these  seven agencies were at risk that OMB and key stakeholders may make  decisions regarding the agencies\u2019 investments without the most current  and accurate information. As such, we recommended that the seven  selected agencies review major IT investment project data reported on  the Dashboard and update the information as appropriate, ensuring that  these data are consistent across all reporting channels.", "Finally, while OMB has issued guidance requiring agency CIOs to certify  that each major IT investment\u2019s plan for the current year adequately  implements incremental development, only three agencies (the  Departments of Commerce, Homeland Security, and Transportation) had  defined processes and policies intended to ensure that the CIOs certify  that major IT investments are adequately implementing incremental  development. Accordingly, we recommended that the remaining four  agencies\u2014the Departments of Defense, Education, Health and Human  Services, and the Treasury\u2014establish policies and processes for  certifying that major IT investments adequately use incremental  development.", "The Departments of Education and Health and Human Services agreed  with our recommendation, while the Department of Defense disagreed  and stated that its existing policies address the use of incremental  development. However, we noted that the department\u2019s policies did not  comply with OMB\u2019s guidance and that we continued to believe our  recommendation was appropriate. The Department of the Treasury did  not comment on its recommendation.", "More recently, in November 2017, we reported that agencies needed to  improve their certification of incremental development. Specifically,  agencies reported that 62 percent of major IT software development  investments were certified by the agency CIO for implementing adequate  incremental development in fiscal year 2017, as required by FITARA as of  August 2016. Table 1 identifies the number of federal agency major IT  software development investments certified for adequate incremental  development, as reported on the IT Dashboard for fiscal year 2017.", "Officials from 21 of the 24 agencies in our review reported that challenges  hindered their ability to implement incremental development, which  included: (1) inefficient governance processes; (2) procurement delays;  and (3) organizational changes associated with transitioning from a  traditional software methodology that takes years to deliver a product, to  incremental development, which delivers products in shorter time frames.  Nevertheless, 21 agencies reported that the certification process was  beneficial because they used the information from the process to assist  with identifying investments that could more effectively use an  incremental approach, and used lessons learned to improve the agencies\u2019  incremental processes.", "In addition, as of August 2017, only 4 of the 24 agencies had clearly  defined CIO incremental development certification policies and processes  that contained descriptions of the role of the CIO in the process and how  the CIO\u2019s certification will be documented; and included definitions of  incremental development and time frames for delivering functionality  consistent with OMB guidance. Figure 7 summarizes our analysis of  agencies\u2019 policies for CIO certification of the adequate use of incremental  development in IT investments.", "Lastly, we reported that OMB\u2019s capital planning guidance for fiscal year  2018 (issued in June 2016) lacked clarity regarding how agencies were  to address the requirement for certifying adequate incremental  development. While the 2018 guidance stated that agency CIOs are to  provide the certifications needed to demonstrate compliance with  FITARA, the guidance did not include a specific reference to the provision  requiring CIO certification of adequate incremental development. We  noted that, as a result of this change, OMB placed the burden on  agencies to know and understand how to demonstrate compliance with  FITARA\u2019s incremental development provision. Further, because of the  lack of clarity in the guidance as to what agencies were to provide, OMB  could not demonstrate how the fiscal year 2018 guidance ensured that  agencies provided the certifications specifically called for in the law.", "Accordingly, in August 2017, OMB issued its fiscal year 2019 guidance,  which addressed the weaknesses we identified in the previous fiscal  year\u2019s guidance. Specifically, the revised guidance requires agency CIOs  to make an explicit statement regarding the extent to which the CIO is  able to certify the use of incremental development, and to include a copy  of that statement in the agency\u2019s public congressional budget justification  materials. As part of the statement, an agency CIO must also identify  which specific bureaus or offices are using incremental development on  all of their investments.", "In our November 2017 report, we made 19 recommendations to 17  agencies to improve reporting and certification of incremental  development. Eleven agencies agreed with our recommendations, 1  partially agreed, and 5 did not state whether they agreed or disagreed.  OMB disagreed with several of our conclusions, which we continued to  believe were valid.", "In total, from May 2014 through November 2017, we have made 42  recommendations to OMB and agencies to improve their implementation  of incremental development. As of November 2017, 34 of our  recommendations remained open."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Need to Better Manage Software Licenses to Achieve Savings", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies engage in thousands of software licensing agreements  annually. The objective of software license management is to manage,  control, and protect an organization\u2019s software assets. Effective  management of these licenses can help avoid purchasing too many  licenses, which can result in unused software, as well as too few licenses,  which can result in noncompliance with license terms and cause the  imposition of additional fees.", "As part of its PortfolioStat initiative, OMB has developed policy that  addresses software licenses. This policy requires agencies to conduct an  annual, agency-wide IT portfolio review to, among other things, reduce  commodity IT spending. Such areas of spending could include software  licenses.", "In May 2014, we reported on federal agencies\u2019 management of software  licenses and determined that better management was needed to achieve  significant savings government-wide. In particular, 22 of the 24 major  agencies did not have comprehensive license policies and only 2 had  comprehensive license inventories. In addition, we identified five leading  software license management practices, and the agencies\u2019  implementation of these practices varied.", "As a result of agencies\u2019 mixed management of software licensing,  agencies\u2019 oversight of software license spending was limited or lacking,  thus potentially leading to missed savings. However, the potential savings  could be significant considering that, in fiscal year 2012, 1 major federal  agency reported saving approximately $181 million by consolidating its  enterprise license agreements, even when its oversight process was ad  hoc. Accordingly, we recommended that OMB issue needed guidance to  agencies; we also made 135 recommendations to the 24 agencies to  improve their policies and practices for managing licenses. Among other  things, we recommended that the agencies regularly track and maintain a  comprehensive inventory of software licenses and analyze the inventory  to identify opportunities to reduce costs and better inform investment  decision making.", "Most agencies generally agreed with the recommendations or had no  comments. As of November 2017, 112 of the recommendations had not  been implemented. Table 2 reflects the extent to which agencies  implemented recommendations in these areas.", "In conclusion, with the enactment of FITARA, the federal government has  an opportunity to save billions of dollars; improve the transparency and  management of IT acquisitions and operations; and to strengthen the  authority of CIOs to provide needed direction and oversight. The forum  we held also recommended that CIOs be given more authority, and noted  the important role played by the Federal CIO.", "Most agencies have taken steps to improve the management of IT  acquisitions and operations by implementing key FITARA initiatives,  including data center consolidation, efforts to increase transparency via  OMB\u2019s IT Dashboard, incremental development, and management of  software licenses; and they have continued to address recommendations  we have made over the past several years. However, additional  improvements are needed, and further efforts by OMB and federal  agencies to implement our previous recommendations would better  position them to fully implement FITARA.", "To help ensure that these efforts succeed, OMB\u2019s and agencies\u2019  continued implementation of FITARA is essential. In addition, we will  continue to monitor agencies\u2019 implementation of our previous  recommendations.", "Chairmen Meadows and Hurd, Ranking Members Connolly and Kelly,  and Members of the Subcommittees, this completes my prepared  statement.
