In 2005, FAA requested that NWS restructure its services by consolidating operations to a smaller number of sites, reducing personnel costs, and providing services 24 hours a day, seven days a week. NWS developed two successive proposals, both of which were rejected by FAA--most recently because the costs were too high. FAA subsequently requested that NWS develop another proposal by late December 2008. In response, NWS developed a third proposal that involves consolidating 20 of 21 existing center weather service units into 2 locations. NWS sent this proposal to FAA in early June 2009. FAA officials stated that they plan to respond to NWS's proposal in early August 2009. In response to GAO's prior concerns that NWS and FAA lacked performance measures and a baseline of current performance, the agencies have agreed on five measures and NWS has proposed eight others. In addition, the agencies initiated efforts to establish a performance baseline for 4 of 13 potential performance measures. However, the agencies have not established baseline performance for the other 9 measures. NWS officials stated that they are not collecting baseline information on the 9 measures for a variety of reasons, including that some of the measures have not yet been approved by FAA, and that selected measures involve products that have not yet been developed. While 4 of the 9 measures are tied to new products or services that are to be developed if NWS's latest restructuring proposal is accepted, the other 5 could be measured in the current operational environment. For example, both forecast accuracy and customer satisfaction measures are applicable to current operations. It is important to obtain an understanding of the current level of performance in these measures before beginning any efforts to restructure aviation weather services. Without an understanding of the current level of performance, NWS and FAA may not be able to measure the success of any changes they make to the center weather service unit operations. As a result, any changes to the current structure could degrade aviation operations and safety--and the agencies may not know it. NWS and FAA face challenges in their efforts to improve the current aviation weather structure. These include challenges associated with (1) interagency collaboration, (2) defining FAA's requirements, and (3) aligning any changes with the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen)--a long-term initiative to increase the efficiency of the national airspace system. If the restructuring proposal is accepted, the agencies face three additional challenges in implementing it: (1) developing a feasible schedule that includes adequate time for stakeholder involvement, (2) undertaking a comprehensive demonstration to ensure no services are degraded, and (3) effectively reconfiguring the infrastructure and technologies to the new structure.

In addition, at any one time, as many as 7,000 aircraft\u2014both  civilian and military\u2014could be aloft over the United States. In 2004, FAA\u2019s  Air Traffic Organization was formed to, among other responsibilities,  improve the provision of air traffic services. More than 33,000 employees  within FAA\u2019s Air Traffic Organization support the operations that help  move aircraft through the national airspace system. The agency\u2019s ability to  fulfill its mission depends on the adequacy and reliability of its air traffic  control systems, as well as weather forecasts made available by NWS and  automated systems. These resources reside at, or are associated with,  several types of facilities: air traffic control towers, terminal radar  approach control facilities, air route traffic control centers (en route  centers), and the Air Traffic Control System Command Center. The  number and functions of these facilities are as follows:    517 air traffic control towers manage and control the airspace within  about 5 miles of an airport. They control departures and landings, as well  as ground operations on airport taxiways and runways.    170 terminal radar approach control facilities provide air traffic control  services for airspace within approximately 40 miles of an airport and  generally up to 10,000 feet above the airport, where en route centers\u2019  control begins. Terminal controllers establish and maintain the sequence  and separation of aircraft.    21 en route centers control planes over the United States\u2014in transit and  during approaches to some airports. Each center handles a different  region of airspace. En route centers operate the computer suite that  processes radar surveillance and flight planning data, reformats it for  presentation purposes, and sends it to display equipment that is used by  controllers to track aircraft. The centers control the switching of voice  communications between aircraft and the center, as well as between the  center and other air traffic control facilities.

Additionally, NWS will need to develop  continuous two-way communications in lieu of having staff onsite at each  en route center. NWS has recognized the infrastructure as a challenge, and  plans to mitigate the risk through continuous dialogue with FAA.  However, if interagency collaboration does not improve, attempting to  coordinate the systems and technology of the two agencies may prove  difficult and further delay the schedule."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Implementation of Draft Recommendations Should Improve Interagency Approach to Aviation Weather", "paragraphs": ["In our draft report, we are making recommendations to the Secretaries of  Commerce and Transportation to improve the aviation weather products  and services provided at FAA\u2019s en route centers. Specifically, we are  recommending that the Secretaries direct the NWS and FAA  administrators, respectively, to improve their ability to measure  improvements in the center weather service units by establishing and  approving a set of performance measures for the center weather service  units, and by immediately identifying the current level of performance for  the five potential measures that could be identified under current  operations (forecast accuracy, customer satisfaction, service delivery  conformity, timeliness of on-demand services, and training completion) so  that there will be a baseline from which to measure the impact of any  proposed operational changes.", "In addition, we are recommending that the Secretaries direct the NWS and  FAA administrators to address specific challenges by  improving interagency collaboration by defining a common outcome,  establishing joint strategies to achieve the outcome, and agreeing upon  each agency\u2019s responsibilities;    establishing and finalizing requirements for aviation weather services at en    ensuring that any proposed organizational changes are aligned with  NextGen initiatives by seeking a review by the Joint Program Development  Office responsible for developing the NextGen vision; and    before moving forward with any proposed operational changes, address  implementation challenges by developing a feasible schedule that includes  adequate time for stakeholder involvement; undertaking a comprehensive  demonstration to ensure no services are degraded; and effectively  transitioning the infrastructure and technologies to the new consolidated  structure.", "In summary, for several years, FAA and NWS have explored ways to  improve the operations of the center weather service units by  consolidating operations and providing remote services. Meanwhile, the  two agencies have to make a decision on the interagency agreement,  which will expire at the end of September 2009. If FAA and NWS are to  create a new interagency agreement that incorporates key dates within the  proposal, decisions on the proposal will have to be made quickly.", "An important component of any effort to improve operations is a solid  understanding of current performance. However, FAA and NWS are not  working to identify the current level of performance in five measures that  are applicable to current operations. Until the agencies have an  understanding of the current level of performance, they will not be able to  measure the success or failure of any changes to the center weather  service unit operations. As a result, any changes to the current structure  could degrade aviation operations and safety\u2014and the agencies may not  know it.", "If the agencies move forward with plans to restructure aviation weather  services, they face significant challenges including a poor record of  interagency collaboration, undocumented requirements, and a lack of  assurance that this plan fits in the broader vision of the Next Generation  Air Transportation System. Moreover, efforts to implement the  restructuring will require a feasible schedule, a comprehensive  demonstration, and a solid plan for technology transition. Until these  challenges are addressed, the proposed restructuring of aviation weather  services at en route centers has little chance of success.", "Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my  statement.
