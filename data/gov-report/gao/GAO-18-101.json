As previously  discussed, the Cost Guide defines the four characteristics\u2014 comprehensive, well documented, accurate, and credible\u2014of a reliable  cost estimate and the associated best practices related to each  characteristic. In conducting these assessments, we examined both the  Form 1391 estimate (i.e., the estimate used to develop the budget) and  the independent government estimate i.e., (the estimate used to award  the contract) for each project. Our analysis of the cost estimates for the  three selected projects shows that the cost estimators did not follow all  the best practices listed for each of the four characteristics. As a result,  none of the characteristics were fully or substantially met. To be reliable,  a cost estimate must substantially or fully meet each of the four  characteristics. As the Cost Guide states, if any of the characteristics are  not met, minimally met, or partially met, then the cost estimate does not  fully reflect the characteristics of a high-quality estimate and cannot be  considered reliable. Table 7 provides the results of our assessment of the  cost estimates for each of the three selected projects.", "The Cost Guide also identifies 12 steps that, when incorporated into an  agency\u2019s cost estimating procedures and guidance, are more likely to  result in reliable and valid cost estimates.

The  Unified Facilities Criteria incorporates some of the 12 steps to some  degree, but not others, and as a result DOD is at a greater risk of  developing estimates that are not reliable. Table 8 provides our  assessment of the extent to which DOD\u2019s Unified Facilities Criteria  incorporates the 12 steps needed to develop a high-quality, reliable cost  estimate.", "Each of the military departments is required to follow the Unified Facilities  Criteria to the greatest extent possible when designing and constructing  facilities. However, as shown by the table above, there are shortcomings  in these criteria when compared with our Cost Guide. Despite these  shortcomings, the military departments have gone beyond the Unified  Facilities Criteria and developed their own guidance that more closely  aligns with our Cost Guide. For example, for both the \u201cdetermining the  estimating structure\u201d and \u201cobtain the data\u201d steps, we found that all three  military departments had developed their own guidance that more closely  aligned with the 12 steps than the Unified Criteria did. In addition, some  military departments are also making improvements to their cost  estimating processes, but these improvements have not been fully  implemented yet. For example, the Air Force Civil Engineer Center is  implementing a cost estimate improvement plan to include the training of  nearly 700 airmen and has conducted a study that directly ties the 12  steps in the Cost Guide to the associated tasks to be completed by the  Air Force cost estimator to meet each individual step. However, the  actions contained in the cost improvement plan have not been fully  implemented and still remain in the concept phase. Similarly, although the  Army Corps of Engineers is investigating expanding the use the of cost  and schedule risk analysis\u2014which could align with the best practices in  the Cost Guide\u2014that the Army currently conducts for selected civil work  construction projects to its high-cost military construction projects, the  Army has not formally required the use of these tools. In appendix IV, we  describe the guidance the military departments have developed beyond  the Unified Facilities Criteria.", "The Cost Guide is designed to establish a consistent methodology that is  based on best practices and that can be used across the federal  government for developing, managing, and evaluating capital program  cost estimates. Air Force and Army Corps of Engineers officials noted  that there may be instances in which following all the 12 steps of the Cost  Guide for every MILCON project would not be appropriate to the risk level  of the project. For example, it may not be realistic or to the military  departments\u2019 benefit for the military departments to conduct a sensitivity  and uncertainty analysis or develop an independent cost estimate for all  the construction projects they initiate every year, especially for low-cost  projects. We agree that it may not be suitable to fully apply all 12 of the  cost estimating steps in the Cost Guide to all MILCON projects. However,  incorporating the 12 steps into the Unified Facilities Criteria would  establish consistency across DOD in the cost estimating process by  ensuring that, for each MILCON project, each step in the Cost Guide  would at least be considered. Furthermore, DOD could choose to  establish thresholds\u2014based on, for example, the dollar values of the  projects\u2014to guide the services in implementing the 12 steps for the most  valuable projects. Skipping or not considering any step of the 12-step cost  estimating process, especially for high-value projects such as those in our  case studies, increases the risk that cost estimates may use improper  assumptions, lack appropriate definition, or be otherwise unreliable.

DOD stated that it did not  believe that it is suitable to fully apply all 12 steps to any construction  project due to characteristics of the military construction program that  DOD believes differ from those of major system or weapon acquisition  programs. However, DOD also stated that it concurred with the intent and  general applicability of the twelve steps to military construction and that  DOD cost estimating guidance lacks specificity in several of these areas.   DOD acknowledged that expanding its cost guidance to more fully  incorporate these steps would benefit the military construction program,  and that it is planning to address this by revising its cost guidance during  Fiscal Year 2019.", "In our report, we recognize that it may not be appropriate to fully apply all  12 steps to each construction project. For example, it may not be realistic  or to the military departments\u2019 benefit to conduct a sensitivity and  uncertainty analysis or develop an independent cost estimate for all the  construction projects they initiate every year, especially for low-cost  projects. Accordingly, we did not recommend that DOD fully apply all 12  steps to each construction project, but rather that it fully incorporate the  12 steps into the Unified Facilities Criteria so that, at least, each step is  considered for each project. DOD could then choose to establish  thresholds\u2014based on, for example, the dollar values of the projects\u2014to  determine for which the 12 steps should be fully applied or other  circumstances in which some steps might not be applicable.

We selected  this time frame because the reprogramming requests were readily  available from DOD. In addition, we judgmentally selected three projects  from this same time frame and reviewed accompanying Forms 1391 and  the reprogramming requests associated with the projects to illustrate  instances in which savings from one MILCON project funded another  project. We collected and analyzed data for fiscal years 2005 through  2016 on the active component MILCON appropriations, obligations, and  disbursements and we collected reprogramming data for fiscal years  2010 through 2016.

This guide is a  compilation of cost estimating best practices drawn from across industry  and federal government. We selected our projects from the universe of  projects that we reasonably expected could have begun execution (i.e.,  projects initiated during fiscal years 2012-2014); projects that were  underway, but not substantially completed (i.e., between 10- and 75- percent complete); and projects that constituted a significant financial  investment (i.e., projects with appropriations of $75 million or greater).  Ultimately, of 690 total projects we identified DOD-wide, 13 met these  criteria and, from this sample, we selected the 3 projects included in this  report: (1) the construction of a replacement elementary school at Camp  Foster, Japan; (2) the construction of a Strategic Command operations  building at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska; and (3) the construction of a  Marine Corps command headquarters and cyberspace operations  building in Fort Meade, Maryland.", "In conducting the assessments for these three selected projects, we  examined the processes used to develop both the Form 1391 estimate  (i.e the form DOD uses to submit project-level requirements and  justifications in support of its MILCON funding requests to Congress ) and  the independent government estimate (i.e., the estimate used to award  the contract)  to determine whether the project cost estimates had the  characteristics of a high-quality and reliable cost estimate, as defined in  the Cost Guide. These projects are not intended to be a projectable  sample, but to illustrate how cost estimates are assessed against best  practices. Although the Camp Foster project is not owned by any of the  active component, the construction and planning of the project is being  led by the Army Corps of Engineers in its capacity as a DOD construction  agent and, as such, we decided to include it in our review. Additionally,  we reviewed DOD\u2019s Unified Facilities Criteria and the active component\u2019s  respective guidance related to MILCON cost estimating and compared  them with the steps needed for developing reliable estimates identified in  the Cost Guide.

An official from the Office of the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment told us  that, to determine whether initial cost estimates were over- or  underestimated, a comparison between initial Form 1391 estimates and  contract award amounts would be a valid approach since contract award  amounts are, in general, estimates of the same requirements identified on  a Form 1391. The official also noted that supervision, inspection,  overhead, and contingency costs included on a Form 1391 are not  included in contract award amounts, which could create differences  between the Form 1391 cost estimates and contract award  prices. Because of this, we excluded the supervision, inspection,  overhead, and contingency costs from the Form 1391 estimates in the  table below to eliminate those differences. Form 1391 cost estimates may  also vary from contract award amounts for reasons such as changes in  project size or scope, changes in project characteristics, unexpectedly  high or low contractor bids, or differences in expected building material  costs, among other things. A negative percent change from the Form  1391 estimate to the contract award amount indicates the estimated  project cost was overestimated and a positive percent change indicates  the project was underestimated.
