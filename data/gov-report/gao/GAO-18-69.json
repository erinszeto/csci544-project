Further, female, Black, and Hispanic workers remain a smaller proportion of the technology workforce\u2014mathematics, computing, and engineering occupations\u2014compared to their representation in the general workforce. These groups have also been less represented among technology workers inside the technology sector than outside it. In contrast, Asian workers were more represented in these occupations than in the general workforce. Stakeholders and researchers GAO interviewed identified several factors that may have contributed to the lower representation of certain groups, such as fewer women and minorities graduating with technical degrees and company hiring and retention practices.", "Both the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) have taken steps to enforce equal employment and affirmative action requirements in the technology sector, but face limitations. While EEOC has identified barriers to recruitment and hiring in the technology sector as a strategic priority, when EEOC conducts investigations, it does not systematically record the type of industry, therefore limiting sector-related analyses to help focus its efforts. EEOC has plans to determine how to add missing industry codes but has not set a timeframe to do this. In addition, OFCCP's regulations may hinder its ability to enforce contractors' compliance because OFCCP directs contractors to set placement goals for all minorities as a group rather than for specific racial/ethnic groups. OFCCP also has not made changes to its establishment-based approach to selecting entities for review in decades, even though changes have occurred in how workplaces are structured. Without taking steps to address these issues, OFCCP may miss opportunities to hold contractors responsible for complying with affirmative action and nondiscrimination requirements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes 6 recommendations, including that EEOC develop a timeline to improve industry data collection and OFCCP take steps toward requiring more specific minority placement goals by contractors and assess key aspects of its selection approach.

As the technology sector has  grown, the nation\u2019s overall workforce has become more diverse and this  trend is expected to continue into the future. Recently, media reports,  technology workforce organizations, and policymakers have raised  questions about diversity in the technology sector workforce and the  extent to which companies are making changes to improve diversity and  prevent discrimination. Diversity has been a focus not only because of  concerns about equal access to these growing and high paying jobs, but  because studies have associated a diversity of perspectives with  enhanced innovation and other business advantages. Federal law  promotes equal employment opportunity by prohibiting companies from  discriminating in employment on the basis of race and gender, among  other things, and generally requires companies contracting with the  federal government to comply with affirmative action and other equal  employment opportunity provisions. The U.S. Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s  Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) are the  primary federal agencies that enforce these requirements.", "You asked us to review gender, ethnic, and racial diversity trends in  technology companies and federal oversight of antidiscrimination laws in  this sector.

Therefore for this report, we defined  technology workers as people who work in occupations in the fields of  computing, engineering, and mathematics. We defined the technology  sector as a group of industries with the highest concentration of  technology workers, such as computer systems design and software  publishing, which is an approach similar to what other federal agencies  have used recently to analyze trends within this sector. To describe the  demographic trends within the technology workforce from 2005 through  2015, we analyzed workforce data from the American Community Survey  (ACS) administered by the U.S. Census Bureau and from the EEOC\u2019s  Employer Information Reports (EEO-1).", "For this report, we used ACS data to estimate populations in technology  occupations which we refer to as technology workers, or the technology  workforce. We compared the technology workforce to the general  workforce, which we defined as workers in all other occupations,  excluding workers in technology occupations, as a benchmark to  understand trends for the technology workforce in the context of overall  workforce trends. In addition, we conducted further analysis of ACS data  to compare technology workers within and outside the technology sector.  Using EEO-1 data, we also analyzed workforce trends among similar  occupations in the workforces of companies within and outside the  technology sector. Our analysis was not designed to determine the  presence or absence of discrimination.", "To understand diversity in academic preparation for technology  occupations, we reviewed 2014 degree completion data from the National  Center for Educational Statistics\u2019 Integrated Postsecondary Education  Data System (IPEDS) as tabulated by the National Science Foundation.  Using a variety of sources, such as academic research and interviews  with representatives from academia, we defined technology-related fields  as degree programs in computer science, engineering, and mathematics.

EEOC is responsible for  enforcement of federal antidiscrimination laws, and OFCCP enforces  affirmative action and nondiscrimination requirements for federal  contractors. EEOC and OFCCP have some shared activities and have  established a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to minimize any  duplication of effort. For example, under the MOU, individual complaints  filed with OFCCP alleging discrimination under Title VII are generally  referred to EEOC.

However, in some cases, these  agencies enforce laws that offer greater protection to workers. An  individual can file a charge with either the EEOC or with a Fair  Employment Practices Agency. When an individual initially files with a  Fair Employment Practices Agency that has a worksharing agreement  with the EEOC, and the allegation is covered by a law enforced by the  EEOC, the Fair Employment Practices Agency will dual file the charge  with EEOC (meaning EEOC will receive a copy of the charge), but will  usually retain the charge for processing. If the charge is initially filed with  EEOC and the charge is also covered by state or local law, EEOC dual  files the charge with the state or local Fair Employment Practices Agency  (meaning the Fair Employment Practices Agency will receive a copy of  the charge), but EEOC ordinarily retains the charge for processing.", "EEOC also pursues a limited number of cases each year designed to  combat systemic discrimination, defined by the agency as patterns or  practices where the alleged discrimination presented by a complainant  has a broad impact on an industry, profession, company, or geographic  location.

In general, OFCCP\u2019s regulations require covered contractors to  comply with certain recordkeeping and reporting requirements, and  provide for enforcement procedures such as compliance evaluations and  complaint investigations to assist OFCCP in ensuring federal contractor  compliance with these regulations.", "Among other provisions, OFCCP\u2019s regulations generally require that  covered contractors prepare and maintain an affirmative action program  (AAP). Under OFCCP\u2019s regulations, an AAP is a management tool that  is designed to ensure equal employment opportunity, with an underlying  premise that the gender, racial, and ethnic makeup of a contractor\u2019s  workforce should be representative of the labor pools from which the  contractor recruits and selects. Companies must create an AAP for  each business establishment\u2014generally, a physical facility or unit that  produces the goods or services, such as a factory, office, or store for the  federal contractor. An AAP will also include any practical steps to  address underrepresentation of women and minorities, such as  expanding employment opportunities to underrepresented groups.  Covered contractors must also comply with certain recordkeeping  requirements, including records pertaining to hiring, promotion, lay off or  termination, rates of pay, and applications, among other records.", "OFCCP\u2019s enforcement program represents the majority of the agency\u2019s  activity and is carried out primarily by using compliance officers, who  evaluate contractors\u2019 compliance with various requirements, according to  agency officials. In addition to conducting compliance evaluations,  OFCCP also conducts investigations in response to complaints. In 2016,  we reported that according to OFCCP officials, responding to complaints  accounted for close to 16 percent of OFCCP\u2019s enforcement activities.  OFCCP selects contractor establishments for evaluations based on a  number of neutrally applied factors, such as employee count at the  establishment, contract value, or contract expiration date. We previously  found that OFCCP reviews, on average, 2 percent of federal contractor  establishments annually.", "As we previously reported, as part of its compliance evaluations, OFCCP  is to review the selected contractor\u2019s hiring, promotion, compensation,  termination, and other employment practices to determine whether  contractors are maintaining nondiscriminatory hiring and employment  practices. OFCCP conducts evaluations at the establishment level.  When a contractor establishment is selected for evaluation, OFCCP  sends the contractor a \u201cscheduling letter\u201d requesting the AAP and  supporting data, such as the percentage of women and minority staff at  the workplace by job group. Then, a compliance officer is to conduct a  desk audit, which is an off-site review of the submitted materials. If  necessary, the compliance officer may also conduct an on-site review or  further off-site analysis to make a final determination as to whether the  contractor is in compliance. In addition to looking at whether federal  contractors maintain nondiscriminatory hiring and employment practices,  which can result in finding discrimination violations, OFCCP also  frequently finds other types of violations, such as failure to keep  necessary records or conduct annual reviews of equal employment and  affirmative action efforts. These findings by the agency often require  administrative changes on the part of the contractor, such as improved  record-keeping. There are many different forms of remedies for  discrimination violations, including financial, employment, and  organizational change remedies.

Similar to the lower  representation of female, Black, and Hispanic technology workers in  technology occupations, we found technology workers from these groups  were also more likely to work outside the technology sector than in the  technology sector. For example, according to our analysis of 2015 ACS  data, women represented an estimated 18 percent of all technology  workers employed in the technology sector, compared to 25 percent of all  technology workers employed outside the technology sector (see fig. 5).  White technology workers were also more represented outside the  technology sector than within the technology sector.", "Companies in the technology sector also employ non-technical workers  such as sales people, and the lower representation of women and certain  minorities in the technology sector was also present in such non-technical  job categories. According to our analysis of EEO-1 data, women were  less represented across the full range of management and non- management positions at companies within the technology sector,  including at leading technology companies, compared to their  representation in companies outside the technology sector. We  determined this by comparing specific occupations at companies both  within and outside the technology sectors using 2015 EEO-1 data. For  example, women held about 19 percent of senior-level management  positions at companies in the technology sector compared to nearly 31  percent of such positions at companies outside the technology sector in  2015.

These include the lower  diversity of degree earners in technology-related fields, and company- based factors such as hiring practices and retention of women and  underrepresented minorities.", "The smaller proportion of women in the technology workforce may reflect  the number of women earning technology-related degrees. Slightly over  two-thirds of technology workers report having earned their bachelor\u2019s  degree in a computer, engineering, mathematics, or technology field.  However, according to our analysis of 2014 IPEDS data, the percentage  of technology-related bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees earned by women  is far less than for men, although women were comparable to men in their  receipt of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) degrees,  and surpassed men in obtaining degrees in all other fields. In 2014,  about 60,000 women were awarded technology-related bachelor\u2019s or  master\u2019s degrees (compared to about 50,000 in 2004) and about 190,000  men were awarded such degrees (compared to about 147,000 in 2004).  (See fig. 8.) An estimated 218,000 technology workers were added to the  technology workforce in 2015, according to our analysis of 2015  American Community Survey data from the U.S. Census Bureau. In  addition, technology degrees are also issued at the associate\u2019s level.", "Two researchers told us that women often have the academic preparation  to enter into technology-related degree programs, but they may choose  not to pursue such degrees because of instances of gender bias within  technology classes. Our prior work reported on studies that found women  leave STEM fields at a higher rate than their male peers, citing one study  that found women leave STEM academic positions at a higher rate than  men in part due to dissatisfaction with departmental culture, faculty  leadership, and research support. Further, a 2012 consulting firm report  found that businesses viewed as male-dominated tended to attract fewer  women at the entry level.", "In addition, according to our analysis of 2014 IPEDS data, three minority  racial or ethnic groups each constituted 10 percent or fewer of bachelor\u2019s  and master\u2019s degree earners in a technology-related field. Specifically,  among the 202,200 earners of degrees in a technology-related field in  2014, there were about 20,000 Hispanic recipients, 13,000 Black  recipients, and 18,000 recipients who were Multiracial or other race,  which includes American Indian or Alaska Native, Other or Unknown  Race, and Two or more Races, i.e. respondents who selected one or  more racial designations. Among all minority groups, Asian students,  including Pacific Islander, earned the highest proportion of technology- related degrees (about 24,000 individuals). (See fig. 9).", "One barrier to entry into technology degree paths for Black and Hispanic  students may be lower likelihood of access to preparatory academic  programs in secondary school. In 2016, we reported that the K-12 public  schools in the United States with students who are mostly Black or  Hispanic offered disproportionately fewer math and science classes for  their students. One researcher told us some colleges and universities,  to help these students be academically successful, provide additional  academic support such as tutoring to help bridge knowledge gaps. To  address the uneven access to preparatory math and science classes,  representatives from five technology companies told us they have started  to invest in exposing Black and Hispanic children to technology  occupations by, for example, developing online resources targeted to  them and their parents and creating partnerships with secondary schools  to improve their academic preparation in computer science.", "However, we have previously also reported that the number of students  graduating with STEM degrees may not be a good measure of the supply  of STEM workers because students often pursue careers in fields  different from the ones they studied. For example, a lower percentage of  women who obtained technology-related degrees became technology  workers compared to men who earned the same degrees, according to  our analysis of 2015 ACS data. Specifically, among women who earned  technology degrees, an estimated 33 percent worked as a technology  worker compared to 45 percent of men who earned technology degrees.", "Several representatives we interviewed from workforce and industry  organizations and technology companies told us that recruitment  practices may also have affected diversity in the technology workforce.  For example, representatives from three workforce and industry  organizations said technology companies tend to recruit from a select  number of universities and colleges, thereby limiting their pool of potential  applicants. To address this, representatives from several of the  technology companies we interviewed told us they had changed  recruitment practices and offered internships targeted to  underrepresented groups. For example, representatives of four  technology companies told us that their companies had expanded  recruitment to include more schools. Representatives from two  companies told us they offer programs such as summer and semester  internships for which the company actively recruits from Historically Black  Colleges and Universities and other specific schools to increase its pool  of diverse candidates.", "In addition, representatives from workforce organizations and technology  companies discussed concerns and strategies to address companies\u2019  hiring practices and internal cultures that may limit workforce diversity.", "For example, one of these representatives said that technology  companies often offer financial incentives to current employees to make  referrals for new hires, which can result in reliance on social networks.  These networks may be largely comprised of the same race and this  practice therefore makes it harder for potential candidates from  demographically different groups to have their resumes reviewed.  Another workforce organization representative reported that some hiring  managers filter out eligible candidates if their background and  qualifications are not the same as those of previously successful  employees. To address these concerns, representatives from one  technology company told us that they had moved away from depending  on referrals since this practice may result in leaders hiring people within  their own networks, which generally does not increase diversity of gender  or race/ethnicity. In addition, representatives from another company said  they plan to begin reviewing resumes with names removed to limit bias by  the reviewer. Further, representatives we interviewed from three  technology companies told us they offer training to employees to help  employees identify their own, unconscious biases.", "Other factors may affect retention of women and underrepresented  minorities. For example, a representative from a workforce organization  said that women leave technology occupations at a higher rate than men  because they feel as if they have not been given the same opportunities  for promotion and advancement within the company. A 2016 study that  examined women in engineering and science found that women\u2019s  concerns about pay and promotion are often an issue in male-dominated  fields regardless of the industry. Further, this study found that retention  difficulties become more severe as the share of men in the workforce  increased and that affected women\u2019s pay and promotion.", "Representatives from one company told us another challenge is the lack  of Black workers at the top levels, which might make it more difficult for  Black employees in particular to see a leadership path. Representatives  we interviewed from five technology companies told us they had  implemented efforts to increase retention and promotion rates among  minority and female workers, for example, by developing a diversity and  inclusion newsletter, employee resource groups with executive  sponsors, and internal training and classes for employees to improve  their readiness to be promoted.", "Representatives from five technology companies told us that commitment  of top leadership is an important factor that can help women and  underrepresented minorities in the technology sector. For example,  representatives from one company told us that top management support  for diversity efforts, such as setting hiring goals, can help move a  company in the direction of achieving representation goals and that  leadership is very important to this effort. Representatives from several  companies told us that there is often a business case for such changes:  These companies work in a diverse, global environment and strive to  make better products for diverse users. However, our prior work on  workforce diversity in the financial services sector found that some  diversity initiatives faced challenges gaining the \"buy-in\" of key  employees, such as the middle managers who are often responsible for  implementing such programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "EEOC and OFCCP Have Taken Steps to Oversee Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action Requirements, but Face Limitations", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "EEOC and OFCCP Have Taken Steps to Oversee Compliance in the Technology Sector", "paragraphs": ["According to EEOC officials, EEOC primarily oversees compliance with  equal employment opportunity requirements by investigating workers\u2019  individual charges of employment discrimination filed against companies.  EEOC has publicly acknowledged the low levels of diversity in the  technology sector. However, we were unable to identify a specific  number of charges received by EEOC against companies in industries  that are part of this sector because EEOC does not require investigators  to record the industry of the charged company. EEOC\u2019s database of  charges and enforcement actions\u2014the Integrated Mission System  (IMS)\u2014has a data field for the North American Industry Classification  System (NAICS) industry code, the standard used by federal statistical  agencies in classifying business establishments. However, we found that  it is completed for only about half the entries in the system. EEOC  officials in both the San Francisco and New York district offices told us  that, while they cannot readily identify individual charges against  technology companies, they believe they have received far fewer charges  against technology companies than they would have expected given the  public attention to the issue of diversity in the technology sector. In  terms of systemic cases, according to EEOC, as of June 2017, the  commission had 255 systemic cases pending since fiscal year 2011 involving technology companies (13 of these were initiated as  commissioner charges and 8 were directed investigations involving age  discrimination or pay parity issues). Officials from the New York region  reported that they had seen an increase in systemic cases against  technology companies in the past 3 years, largely involving practices of  information technology staffing firms.", "Several EEOC officials we interviewed noted that technology workers  may be initiating few complaints at the federal level due to factors such as  fear of retaliation from employers or the availability of other employment  or legal options. According to EEOC officials, fear of retaliation can affect  charges across sectors and, given the growth in the technology  workforce, an individual who feels discriminated against may simply leave  the company because there are many other opportunities for individuals  with technical skills. They also said that technology workers may  generally have greater wealth and can afford to hire private attorneys to  sue in state court rather than go through the EEOC. Moreover, they said  that some states, including California, have stronger employment  discrimination laws that allow for better remedies than federal laws, which  could lead employees to file charges at the state level rather than with the  EEOC.", "In addition, EEOC has acknowledged in a 2016 report that binding  arbitration policies, which require individuals to submit their claims to  private arbiters rather than courts, can also deter workers from bringing  discrimination claims to the agency, leaving significant violations in entire  segments of the workforce unreported. The report stated that an  increasing number of arbitration policies have added bans on class  actions that prevent individuals from joining together to challenge  practices in any forum. The report concluded that the use of arbitration  policies hinders EEOC\u2019s ability to detect and remedy potential systemic  violations. Researchers report that the use of such clauses has grown  and data on federal civil filings for civil rights employment cases reflect a  marked reduction in the number of such filings.", "Beyond pursuing charges, EEOC has taken some steps to address  diversity in the technology sector including research and outreach efforts.  In May 2016, citing the technology sector as a source for an increasing  number of U.S. jobs, EEOC released a report analyzing EEO-1 data on  diversity in the technology sector in tandem with a commission meeting  raising awareness on the topic. In addition, EEOC\u2019s fiscal year 2017- 2021 Strategic Enforcement Plan identified barriers to hiring and  recruiting in the technology sector as a strategic priority. EEOC has also  been involved in outreach efforts with the technology sector. For example,  the EEOC Pacific Region described more than 15 in-person or webinar  events since 2014 in collaboration with OFCCP and local organizations  focused on diversity in the technology sector. The topics of these events  included equity in pay and the activities of these two agencies in  enforcing nondiscrimination laws. Finally, in fall 2016, EEOC initiated an  internal working group to identify practices to help improve gender and  racial diversity in technology, but as of June 2017 had no progress to  report.", "OFCCP\u2019s regulations require covered federal contractors to take  proactive steps to ensure equal employment opportunity. OFCCP  annually conducts routine evaluations of selected federal contractors,  which includes those in the technology sector, for compliance with federal  nondiscrimination and affirmative action requirements. To the extent  that technology contractors are selected for evaluation through OFCCP\u2019s  normal selection process, these contractors are assessed for compliance  with nondiscrimination and affirmative action laws as are other selected  contractors. While evaluation of technology contractors occurs in the  course of OFCCP\u2019s routine activities, OFCCP does not currently use type  of industry as a selection factor, according to officials. We also found that  few (less than 1 percent) of OFCCP\u2019s 2,911 closed technology contractor  evaluations from fiscal years 2011 through 2016 resulted in discrimination  violations, though 13 percent resulted in other violations, such as record- keeping violations and failure to establish an affirmative action program  (AAP). An AAP is a key tool OFCCP requires contractors to complete to  ensure equal employment opportunity. The remaining 86 percent of  evaluations either found no violations or ended in administrative closure.  Technology contractor evaluations that had discrimination violations  resulted in back pay, salary adjustments, or other benefits totaling more  than $4.5 million for 15,316 individuals (averaging about $300 per award)  for fiscal years 2011 through 2016. The vast majority of discrimination  violations were on the basis of gender or race/ethnicity rather than  disability or veteran status. Corrective actions OFCCP identified for  federal technology contractors over this timeframe also included requiring  contractors to fill a total of 410 job vacancies as they arise with applicants  who had been denied employment on the basis of discrimination. In  addition, OFCCP recently filed three complaints against technology  companies.", "According to our analysis, OFCCP conducted evaluations on 36 of the 65  leading technology companies from fiscal year 2011 through fiscal year  2016. During this timeframe there were 272 reviews of establishments\u2014 physical business locations\u2014affiliated with these 36 companies. Based  on these evaluations, 15 of the 36 companies had administrative  violations, and 2 of the 36 also had discrimination violations. As a result of  the discrimination findings against these leading technology companies,  541 individuals received monetary benefits totaling $783,387 (an average  of $1,448 per award).", "In terms of other steps to conduct oversight of the technology sector,  OFCCP officials in the Pacific Region said they are hiring compliance  officers with legal training to be better able to address needs for reviews  in the technology sector, such as responding to lawyers representing  technology contractors. Officials in both the Pacific and Northeast regions  work closely with statisticians and labor economists on their cases, an  effort officials said has increased over the past few years. OFCCP has  also requested funding in its fiscal year 2018 congressional budget  justification to establish centers in San Francisco and New York that  would develop expertise to handle large, complex compliance evaluations  in specific industries, including information technology."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EEOC Cannot Analyze Charge Data by Industry to Identify Priorities and OFCCP Faces Challenges to Oversight of Technology Companies", "paragraphs": ["We found that by not requiring an industry code in its investigations data,  EEOC cannot analyze charge data by industry to help identify  investigation and outreach priorities, in contradiction to EEOC strategic  planning documents and EEOC Inspector General reports, which have  emphasized the importance of doing so. By not requiring the use of the  NAICS code for each entry in IMS, EEOC is limited in its ability to use  these data for the purposes of identifying charges by industry sector and  conducting sector-related analyses. Officials were aware of substantial  gaps in coding of charges by industry and acknowledged limitations in the  commission\u2019s ability to analyze its investigations data by industry.  However, officials expressed concern that routinely creating more  complete records of the companies against which charges had been filed  would require investigators to divert attention from their efforts to  investigate charges. EEOC officials explained that the charging party  provides initial information on the respondent company and requiring  EEOC personnel to generate this information would slow down the  process. They said their priority is to investigate individual charges, not to  address larger trends or target specific industries. \u201cThe Strategic Enforcement Plan recommends using EEOC data to allow our  enforcement and outreach efforts to focus on areas of significant concern. This  might include tailoring outreach efforts for industries that experience greater  likelihood of certain charges or informing enforcement decisions based on  knowledge that certain industries have persistent problems, such as harassment.  The data maintained in IMS provide a rich resource of information that can be  used to explore the characteristics of industries that appear to have higher levels  of certain allegations than comparative industries.\u201d", "In addition, reports completed by the Urban Institute for the EEOC Office  of Inspector General in 2013 and 2015 similarly recommended analysis of  charge data, including by industry, to help identify priorities and measure  performance.", "While EEOC has plans to review a year of IMS data to clean it and  determine how best to add missing industry codes, among other  objectives, officials could not provide a specific timeframe for when this  review would begin and end. Standards for internal control in the federal  government state that management should use quality information to  achieve the agency\u2019s objectives and objectives should be defined in  specific terms so they are understood at all levels of the entity. This  involves clearly defining what is to be achieved, who is to achieve it, how  it will be achieved, and the time frames for achievement. Efforts to scrub  these data and identify missing codes could help EEOC determine how to  collect industry information on an ongoing basis for all entries. Doing so  would also help EEOC determine the level of NAICS code that would be  feasible and useful for investigators to identify and input into IMS.  Without analyzing its data on charges across industries, EEOC\u2019s ability to  proactively identify priorities for its outreach and enforcement resource  use is limited.", "We found that OFCCP also faces challenges that may hinder the  agency\u2019s oversight of technology companies. Specifically, OFCCP  reported facing delays in receiving information from federal contractors,  including technology companies, but has not yet evaluated whether its  own policies and practices also impede its efforts to hold federal  technology contractors responsible for the legal requirements to take  affirmative action and not discriminate against protected groups. In  addition, OFCCP regulations do not require federal contractors to  disaggregate data for the purpose of determining placement goals for  hiring, which may hinder contractors\u2019 efforts to implement effective  affirmative action programs.", "OFCCP has not analyzed delays in obtaining information from  contractors  OFCCP officials told us that they face delays in obtaining complete,  accurate, and timely documentation from federal contractors, including  technology companies, as part of the compliance review process. They  said this limited their access to critical information and hindered OFCCP\u2019s  ability to determine whether discrimination had occurred. Officials in the  Pacific Region reported that when issues are identified during OFCCP\u2019s  initial review that will require additional data, the data requests can be  extensive. Consequently, technology contractors are taking longer to  submit complete and accurate data that are needed to conduct analyses  of the contractor\u2019s workforce. In addition, officials in both the Pacific and  Northeast regions reported that companies may not provide raw data as  requested, or provide access to employees for OFCCP to interview,  which is part of the compliance review process. Using 2015 OFCCP  compliance evaluation data, we previously reported that close to 85  percent of contractor establishments across all sectors did not submit an  AAP within 30 days of being scheduled for an OFCCP compliance  evaluation, as required by OFCCP policy. Officials told us of the  potential need for a more flexible set of investigatory tools or sanctions,  such as subpoena power to speed up data-gathering or penalties for  delays in providing information, in order to obtain accurate and timely  information. In the case of incomplete data, OFCCP officials said one  option is to enter into an agreement with the contractor whereby the  contractor will gather the missing data, and OFCCP will monitor the  contractor\u2019s efforts and review detailed records at a later date. However,  they said that such an agreement could give the contractor an opportunity  to modify the data in the contractor\u2019s favor. Currently, OFCCP\u2019s primary  sanction is the threat of debarment, which makes a company ineligible to  receive future federal contracts.", "At the same time, OFCCP officials acknowledged there may additionally  be delays in their own review processes. In prior work, we\u2019ve reported  concerns by contractors and industry groups about lengthy and expansive  OFCCP evaluations. However, OFCCP has not analyzed its data on  closed evaluations to assess the cause of delays, which would help  determine whether changes should be made to its internal processes or if  stronger sanctions to obtain information from contractors are needed.  Internal control standards state that management should identify,  analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving its objectives. Further,  it states that management should design appropriate mechanisms to  enforce its directives to achieve those objectives and address related  risks. Without more information on the root cause of the delays, these  delays may continue, straining resources and inhibiting OFCCP\u2019s efforts  to identify potential discrimination. \u201cAn affirmative action program is a management tool designed to ensure equal  employment opportunity. A central premise underlying affirmative action is that,  absent discrimination, over time a contractor\u2019s workforce, generally, will reflect  the gender, racial and ethnic profile of the labor pools from which the contractor  recruits and selects. Affirmative action programs contain a diagnostic component  which includes a number of quantitative analyses designed to evaluate the  composition of the workforce of the contractor and compare it to the composition  of the relevant labor pools. Affirmative action programs also include action- oriented programs. If women and minorities are not being employed at a rate to  be expected given their availability in the relevant labor pool, the contractor\u2019s  affirmative action program includes specific practical steps designed to address  this underutilization.\u201d \u201cThe placement goal-setting process . . . contemplates that contractors will,  where required, establish a single goal for all minorities. In the event of a  substantial disparity in the utilization of a particular minority group or in the  utilization of women or women of a particular minority group, a contractor may be  required to establish separate goals for those groups.\u201d", "According to OFCCP officials, a contractor may be required to establish  separate goals for particular minority groups as part of a compliance  review. We found, however, that OFCCP\u2019s regulations do not require  federal contractors to disaggregate demographic data for the purpose of  establishing placement goals in their AAP. This may hinder their efforts to  implement effective AAPs, which are designed to assist the company in  achieving a workforce that reflects the gender, racial, and ethnic profile of  the labor pools from which the contractor recruits and selects. OFCCP  officials in headquarters and in the field said, based on their experience  evaluating companies\u2019 compliance, it was not common for companies to  have placement goals disaggregated by race and ethnicity in their AAPs.  A diversity and inclusion officer we interviewed from one large technology  contractor noted that the requirement in the AAP to identify the need for  placement goals for minorities as a whole does not address  underrepresentation in certain minority groups. According to the officer,  the company does not count Asian workers in setting the company\u2019s  diversity goals because Asians are well represented and the company  believes it should set a placement goal for groups for which the company  knows it needs to make progress. Citing comments received during  development of other regulations, OFCCP officials cautioned that an  analysis of utilization disaggregated by race/ethnicity may be more  challenging for smaller companies with fewer employees.", "Further, looking at trends in diversity for minorities as a whole may not  assist a company\u2019s affirmative action efforts to identify groups that need  particular outreach or support. Specifically, our analysis of workforce data  found differences in representation for Black and Hispanic workers in the  technology workforce compared to Asian workers. Under the current AAP  regulations, companies may opt not to detect and address  underrepresentation of particular minority groups since OFCCP does not  require placement goals disaggregated by race/ethnicity. While OFCCP  may be able to detect underrepresentation of particular minority groups  during its reviews, the office reviews only 2 percent of federal contractor  establishments each year. OFCCP officials said that they would need to  amend their regulations in order to require disaggregated race/ethnicity  information for placement goals on AAPs. The officials said  disaggregating race in placement goals could help an establishment  determine how to tailor outreach accordingly or better identify  impediments to its equal employment opportunity efforts. However, they  have not pursued this regulatory change because of competing priorities  on their regulatory agenda. OFCCP\u2019s mission includes holding federal  contractors responsible for the legal requirements to take affirmative  action and not discriminate against protected groups. However, not  requiring contractors to set placement goals for each minority group may  hinder OFCCP\u2019s ability to effectively achieve this mission.", "OFCCP has not reviewed key aspects of its current approach to  evaluations  OFCCP officials report the agency intends to incorporate additional  information on gender, racial, and ethnic disparities by industry into its  compliance evaluation selection process, but we found the methodology  to determine the disparities may have weaknesses. We have previously  reported on the challenges OFCCP faces with its enforcement efforts,  and identified additional areas that may limit OFCCP\u2019s enforcement of  federal contractors\u2019 equal employment and affirmative action efforts. For  example, our 2016 report found that OFCCP\u2019s weak compliance  evaluation selection process, reliance on voluntary compliance, and lack  of staff training create several challenges to its enforcement efforts. This  report found that because OFCCP was not able to identify which factors  are associated with risk of noncompliance, the agency does not have  reasonable assurance that it is focusing its efforts on those contractors at  greatest risk of not following nondiscrimination or affirmative action  requirements. OFCCP agreed with recommendations we made to  address these areas and detailed steps the agency would take. In  particular, to strengthen its compliance evaluation process to select  contractors at greatest risk of potential discrimination, the agency stated  that it planned to incorporate information on pay disparities and  employment disparities. OFCCP officials indicated this information  would be based on analysis of gender and race/ethnicity by industry using  ACS data and EEO-1 compensation data that was to be collected  beginning March 2018. However, in August 2017, the Office of  Management and Budget issued a memo suspending the pay-related  data collection aspects of the EEO-1 form. Despite this change, OFCCP  officials said they are exploring other options for focusing on  compensation disparities by industry, including through the use of ACS  data, administrative data, a previous study conducted by the Department  of Labor, as well as options proposed by contractors.", "We also found OFCCP\u2019s current methodology for identifying disparities by  industry with the ACS data may have some weaknesses that could affect  the accuracy of the outcomes. For example, its reliance on the broadest  industry level available may not sufficiently identify specific industries at  elevated risk. Further, the methodology includes future plans to conduct  the analysis for metropolitan areas. Given the importance of regional and  local labor markets for assessing affirmative action efforts, regional and  local analysis should also be completed before OFCCP incorporates this  analysis into its selection process. It is important that OFCCP use reliable  information in modifying its basic processes and setting priorities. For the  reasons cited earlier regarding the importance of using quality information  to make management decisions, it is important that OFCCP assess the  quality of the methods for its analysis of employment disparities among  industries. Without doing so, OFCCP may not accurately identify  industries at greatest risk of potential noncompliance with  nondiscrimination and affirmative action requirements so it can focus its  limited investigation resources most effectively.", "Further, according to OFCCP officials, although the agency has made  slight changes to various thresholds and factors for its selection process,  the agency has not made any significant changes to the selection process  for about 10 years, and has made no changes to its establishment-based  approach since OFCCP was founded in 1965. While OFCCP currently  grounds its review of a contractor in a particular physical establishment,  OFCCP officials acknowledged the changing nature of a company\u2019s work  can involve multiple locations and corresponding changes in the scope of  hiring and recruitment. Officials we interviewed from five of our eight  selected technology companies discussed their work spread across  locations, including the United States or overseas, and the related  challenges they face with OFCCP\u2019s establishment-based approach to  reviews. One company representative said the AAP is not useful because  site specific plans do not connect to business decisions. However,  OFCCP has not reviewed the implications for the effectiveness of its  mission of continuing with its establishment-based approach to  conducting compliance evaluations.", "In addition, OFCCP officials acknowledged their inability, in identifying  establishments for review, to consistently identify and include all  subcontractors to which OFCCP rules should apply. They said the agency  has not assessed the potential significance of any omissions of  subcontractors from the oversight process. Internal control standards  state that management should identify risks throughout the entity related  to achieving its defined objectives to form a basis for designing risk  responses, as well as the importance of periodically reviewing policies,  procedures and related control activities for continued relevance and  effectiveness in achieving the agency\u2019s objectives. OFCCP officials said  they have informally discussed how to adjust their work based on how  work is performed in today\u2019s economy\u2014with virtual sites, workplace  flexibilities, and nontraditional forms of employment. However, due to  competing priorities, they have not conducted a formal review of these  key aspects of its current approach to selecting entities for review. They  acknowledged such a review would be useful. Without assessing its  current approach to its establishment-based reviews and identification of  all relevant subcontractors, OFCCP does not have reasonable assurance  that its approach can identify discrimination occurring within the  companies it oversees and may be missing opportunities to identify more  effective practices or adjust its methods to external changes.", "While OFCCP has offered an option\u2014the Functional Affirmative Action  Program (FAAP)\u2014for companies to move away from establishment- based reviews and which may be more appropriate for some multi\u2013 establishment contractors, uptake has been low and the agency has not  conducted an evaluation of this program. Since 2002, OFCCP has  allowed companies to create FAAPs, with OFCCP approval, which are  based on a business function or unit that may exist at multiple  establishments. As of May 2017, 73 companies across all industries had  FAAPs in place. Further, some of the companies we interviewed were  unaware that the FAAP was an option or believed it was cumbersome to  establish given the complexity of their workforce. Asked why the FAAP  has not been more broadly adopted, OFCCP officials hypothesized it  could have to do with a requirement intended to ensure that companies  with FAAPs would be reviewed at least as often as others, but that may  result in these companies being reviewed more often than most.  Standards for internal control for government agencies state that  management should periodically review policies, procedures, and related  control activities for continued relevance and effectiveness in achieving  the entity\u2019s objectives. Reviewing and refining the FAAP program could  help OFCCP improve its ability to achieve its objectives and may provide  broader insight for OFCCP\u2019s overall enforcement approach."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Jobs in the high paying technology sector are projected to grow in coming  years. Female, Black, and Hispanic workers, however, comprised a  smaller proportion of technology workers compared to their  representation in the general workforce from 2005 through 2015, and  have also been less represented among technology workers inside the  technology sector than outside it. Both EEOC\u2019s and OFCCP\u2019s mission is  to combat discrimination and support equal employment opportunity for  U.S. workers; however, weaknesses in their processes impact the  effectiveness of their efforts. When conducting investigations, EEOC has  not been consistently capturing information on industry codes. This  impedes its ability to conduct industry sector analysis that could be used  to more effectively focus its limited enforcement resources and outreach  activities. Similarly, OFCCP faces delays in its compliance review process  but it has not analyzed its closed evaluations to understand the causes of  these delays and whether its processes need to be modified to reduce  them. In addition, as part of their affirmative action programs federal  contractors are only required to set placement goals for all minorities in  general. By not requiring contractors to disaggregate demographic data  for the purpose of establishing placement goals, OFCCP has limited  assurance that these contractors are setting goals that will address  potential underrepresentation in certain minority groups.", "Further, OFCCP plans to incorporate information on disparities by  industry into its process for selecting establishments for compliance  evaluations, but has not fully assessed its planned methods. Without such  assessment, OFCCP may use a process that does not effectively identify  the industries at greatest risk of potential noncompliance with  nondiscrimination and affirmative action requirements. In addition, key  aspects of OFCCP\u2019s approach to compliance reviews of contractors\u2019  affirmative action efforts have not changed in over 50 years, whereas the  structure and locations of these companies\u2019 work have changed. Finally,  although OFCCP has developed an alternative affirmative action program  for multi-establishment contractors, few contractors participate in this  program.
