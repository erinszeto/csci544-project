For example, a fiscal year 2016 presidential memorandum\u2014rescinded in 2017\u2014required agencies to develop implementation plans to identify the potential impact of climate change on human mobility, among other things. In general, however, climate change as a driver of migration was not a focus of the executive branch actions. For example, a fiscal year 2014 executive order\u2014also rescinded in 2017\u2014requiring agencies to prepare for the impacts of climate change did not highlight migration as a particular concern.", "State, USAID, and DOD have discussed the potential effects of climate change on migration in agency plans and risk assessments. For example, State and USAID required climate change risk assessments when developing country and regional strategies, and a few of the strategies reviewed by GAO identified the nexus of climate change and migration as a risk. However, State changed its approach in 2017, no longer providing missions with guidance on whether and how to include climate change risks in their integrated country strategies. In doing so, State did not include in its 2018 guidance to the missions any information on how to include climate change risks, should the missions choose to do so. Without clear guidance, State may miss opportunities to identify and address issues related to climate change as a potential driver of migration.", "The three agencies have been involved in climate change related activities but none were specifically focused on the nexus with global migration.

Climate change may intensify slow-onset disasters, such as  drought, crop failure, and sea level rise. Climate change is also increasing  the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including sudden- onset disasters, such as floods, according to key scientific  assessments.  These effects of climate change may alter existing  migration trends across the globe, according to IOM. (See appendix II for  further discussion of climate change as a driver of migration in seven  geographic regions.) For example, sea level rise, a slow-onset disaster,  may result in the salinization of soil and drinking water, thereby  undermining a country or community\u2019s ability to sustain livelihoods and  maintain critical services, which could cause some people to migrate.  Sudden-onset disasters may also contribute to migration as people flee  natural disasters, in most cases leading to temporary displacement. For  example, people may either voluntarily migrate, or be forced to migrate, to  earn money needed to rebuild damaged homes after flooding, especially  as extreme weather events increase in intensity and number. If unable or  unwilling to migrate, people may find themselves trapped or choosing to  stay in deteriorating conditions.

Increases in temperature greater than  1\u00b0C may result in the near loss of the entire ice sheet over a millennium  and significant sea level rise, according to the IPCC. In the short term,  predicting the ice sheet\u2019s melting rate is a challenge as predictions vary in  the scientific community. Accurate predictions would support mitigation  and adaptation efforts in vulnerable areas. Rising temperatures and  shrinking ice cover have shifted the distribution and migration patterns of  marine mammals and fish, and impacted food security according to the  IPCC and the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental forum for Arctic states.  For example, the economy in Paamiut, Greenland, depended primarily on  cod fisheries until changing climate conditions caused cod to disappear,  and the town was slow to adapt to newly available shrimp. Similarly,  fisheries in Disko Bay, Greenland, have struggled to adapt to new  conditions. Rising temperatures and the resulting reduction in ice cover  have required a shift to fishing from boats in open water instead of  hunting and fishing over ice cover. Lastly, warming and ice melt may  make significant oil and mineral deposits accessible for extraction in the  future. The potential expansion of extraction industries makes  environmental sustainability another possible concern. For example, an  estimated 31 billion barrels of oil and gas may exist off the coast of  Northeast Greenland, according to the Kingdom of Denmark\u2019s 2011-2020  Arctic Strategy. The strategy stresses the importance of assessing and  reducing risks to the environment resulting from the exploration and  extraction of oil and gas.", "The effects of climate change are predicted to contribute to internal and  external migration in Greenland. For example, young people are  increasingly leaving indigenous communities in rural areas for cities in  Greenland in search of work, as traditional livelihoods become  unsustainable. Greenland is home to a majority indigenous population,  primarily Inuit, whose traditional hunting and fishing practices require  travel across ice. In the past, people adapted to seasonal changes to  support livelihoods by migrating, and the practice was embedded into  indigenous social structures. With reduced ice cover, however, migrating  to hunt, fish, and maintain connections to community is more dangerous  or restricted. Government policies promoting centralized services, such  as health care and education, have also played a role in the shift away  from migration as a way of life. As a result, indigenous livelihoods are  more difficult to maintain, and young people often migrate to towns and  cities in Greenland, or to Denmark, for education. At the same time,  warmer temperatures have made mineral extraction feasible. As the  extraction industry grows, new jobs may draw migrants from outside the  Arctic region. In 2011 companies spent $100 million on the exploration of  minerals in the Artic, and the estimated number of new mines is expected  to require more workers than now live in the region.17 79Currently, more  people leave than migrate to Greenland.", "The local Inuit population in  Uummannaq, Greenland relies  heavily on ice coverage for fishing  and travel by traditional dog-sled.", "Brookings-LSE Project on Internal Displacement, A Complex Constellation:  Displacement, Climate Change and Arctic Peoples (January 30, 2013).", "Brookings-LSE Project on Internal Displacement.", "The effects of climate change on Sub-Saharan Africa vary depending on  the region and have impacts on migration and security, according to the  International Organization for Migration (IOM).

Permanent migration south as well as to cities may become  more common if land suitable for farming decreases. As fish habitats like  Lake Chad dry up, fishery workers may also migrate. Larger urban  populations on the coast will put more people at risk of sea level rise,  water inundation, and erosion, according to the IPCC. A rise in sea level  of 1 meter could put over 3 million people at risk of displacement as the  IPCC has reported. Herders have also moved further south due to  increased drought in northern Nigeria, as UNEP and USIP have reported.

Nigerians fleeing attacks from Boko Haram in the north have gone  to communities in neighboring Chad, Cameroon, and Niger that are  already experiencing food shortages due in part to climate change. These  neighboring countries as a result have fewer resources to support both  their own residents and the newer refugees.
