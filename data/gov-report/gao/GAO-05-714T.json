I will also  discuss recommendations that we have made in previous testimony and  briefings and the actions AOC has taken in response. We testified on this  topic before the Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch, House  Committee on Appropriations, in July 2003, and we have periodically  briefed congressional representatives, the CVC project executive, and the  Architect of the Capitol since then.", "My statement is based on our monitoring of the CVC project, which  included reviewing monthly status reports, contract files, schedules,  contractors\u2019 cost estimates, other organizations\u2019 construction management  policies and procedures, industry best practices, and data for construction  projects compiled by the Construction Industry Institute and the Bureau of  Labor Statistics. We have attended regularly scheduled meetings on the  CVC project\u2019s progress; observed construction work at the site; and  discussed management, procurement, and safety issues with AOC,  contractor personnel, as well as experienced construction and contract  management personnel at other organizations. Additionally, we obtained  expert assistance in analyzing construction project costs and schedules  from KPMG, Hulett & Associates, and the Defense Contract Audit Agency  (DCAA). We did not perform an audit; rather, we performed our work to  assist Congress in conducting its oversight activities.", "Before I summarize our principal observations and recommendations for  moving forward, let me briefly set the stage. As previously noted, AOC is  managing and has overall responsibility for this complex project, but a  construction management firm, Gilbane Building Company, is providing a  range of construction management services in support of AOC, including  coordinating the activities of the major construction contractors,  monitoring worker safety, and providing AOC with status information for  reporting to Congress. AOC is implementing the project in two phases, or  sequences. In June 2002, it awarded the sequence 1 contract for the  excavation and structural work to Centex Construction Company, and in  April 2003, it awarded the sequence 2 contract for mechanical, electrical,  plumbing and interior finishing work to Manhattan Construction  Company.", "In summary, the CVC project is taking about 2 years longer than planned  and is expected to cost between about $522 million and $559 million\u2014 significantly more than originally estimated.

Except for some punch-list items, such as fixing water leaks, construction  work under the sequence 1 contract is now complete. This work includes  the basic structure, the truck and Library of Congress tunnels, and the  East Front interface. AOC and its contractors also completed work  associated with the Inauguration. Work has started on the sequence 2  contract, including fitting out and finishing the basic structure and the  Library of Congress tunnel and constructing the utility tunnel and space  for the exhibits. AOC has just made contractual arrangements for fitting  out and finishing the Senate and House expansion spaces and is now  procuring the House Connector tunnel and the connection between the  Library of Congress tunnel and the Jefferson building.", "AOC\u2019s scheduled completion date for CVC is now September 2006, nearly  20 months later than originally planned. We believe, given past problems  and future risks and uncertainties, that the completion date may be  delayed until sometime between December 2006 and March 2007.  Additionally, AOC\u2019s scheduled completion date for the interior of the  House and Senate expansion spaces is March 2007.", "The project\u2019s schedule delays are due in part to scope changes, design  changes, and unforeseen conditions beyond AOC\u2019s control (e.g., adding  the Senate and House expansion spaces and encountering underground  obstructions). However, factors more within AOC\u2019s control also  contributed to the delays. First, the original schedule was overly  optimistic. Second, AOC has had difficulty obtaining acceptable,  contractually required schedules from its contractors, such as a master  summary schedule from its construction management contractor. In  addition, AOC and its contractors did not adhere to contract provisions  designed for effective schedule management, including those calling for  monthly progress review meetings and schedule updates and revisions.  AOC and its construction management contractor also had difficulty  coordinating the work of the sequence 1 and 2 contractors and did not  systematically track and document delays and their causes as they  occurred or apportion time and costs to the appropriate parties on a  timely basis. Additionally, AOC has not yet reached full agreement with  CPC on the extent to which construction must be completed before the  facility can be opened to the public, and AOC has not yet developed an  overall summary schedule that links the completion of construction with  the steps necessary to prepare CVC for facility operations. Finally, AOC  needs to fully implement our recommendation that it develop plans to  mitigate the project\u2019s remaining risks and uncertainties, such as shortages  in the supply of stone or skilled stone workers, unforeseen conditions  associated with the remaining underground tunnels, and commissioning  the building in the allotted time.", "We have made numerous recommendations to improve schedule  management, and AOC has taken actions to implement most of them. We  believe, however, that both AOC and its construction management  contractor will need to sustain their attention and apply additional effort  to managing the project\u2019s schedule, as well as fully implement our  recommendations, to help keep the project on track and as close to budget  as possible. More specifically, AOC needs to give priority attention to:    obtaining and maintaining acceptable project schedules, including  reassessing the times allotted for completing sequence 2 work;   aggressively monitoring and managing contractors\u2019 adherence to the  schedule, including documenting and addressing the causes of delays;   developing and implementing risk mitigation plans;  reaching agreement on what project elements must be complete before  CVC can open to the public; and preparing a summary schedule, as Congress requested, that integrates the  major steps needed to complete CVC construction with the steps  necessary to prepare for operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stronger Contract Management Needed", "paragraphs": ["AOC is relying on contractors to design, build, and help manage CVC\u2019s  construction and help prepare for its operation. AOC has obligated over  $350 million for contracts and contract modifications for these activities.  We found that AOC needed to take additional steps to ensure that it was  (1) receiving reasonable prices for proposed contract modifications, (2)  obtaining adequate support for contractors\u2019 requests for reimbursement of  incurred costs, (3) adequately overseeing its contractors\u2019 performance,  and (4) taking appropriate steps to see that contractual work is not done  before it is appropriately authorized under contractual arrangements.", "Initially, AOC was not preparing independent government estimates as  part of its price analyses for proposed modifications to the two major  contracts. In early 2004, AOC hired an employee for the CVC staff with  contract management experience, and AOC has improved its capacity to  obtain reasonable prices by, among other things, preparing government  estimates as part of its effort to evaluate the reasonableness of prices  offered by the contractors for the proposed modifications.", "Although most CVC work is being done under fixed price contracts, for  which payment is not based on incurred costs, AOC has received or is  anticipating requests for reimbursement of over $30 million in costs that  the contractors say they incurred because of delays. In addition, AOC has  awarded some contract modifications for unpriced work that will require  reliable information on incurred costs. According to the Defense Contract  Audit Agency, several concerns relating to the contractors\u2019 accounting  systems need to be addressed to ensure the reliability of the contractors\u2019  incurred cost information.", "AOC has continued to experience difficulty getting fully acceptable  performance from contractors. For example, as of April 30, 2005, the  construction management contractor had not provided an acceptable  master schedule identifying appropriate links between tasks and key  milestones, and it has not been providing AOC with accurate safety data  for an extended period of time. Similarly, one of AOC\u2019s major construction  contractors had not corrected recurring safety concerns over an extended  period.", "One of AOC\u2019s CVC consultants began work several months before AOC  had awarded a contract to it authorizing the work. AOC agreed to take  action to prevent this type of problem from recurring.  We have made several recommendations to enhance AOC\u2019s contract  management. AOC has generally agreed and taken action to implement  these recommendations. For example, it has enhanced its capacity to  review cost-related data submitted by contractors with requests for  reimbursement based on incurred costs, and it has better evaluated its  construction management contractor\u2019s performance and taken action to  obtain improvements. To help prevent further schedule delays and control  cost growth, AOC needs to aggressively manage its contractors\u2019  performance, particularly in the areas of managing schedules and  obtaining reasonable prices on contractual actions, and continue to ensure  that contractors\u2019 requests for payment based on incurred costs are  adequately evaluated. It also needs to ensure that its contractors report  accurate safety data and promptly act to correct safety concerns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Project Costs and Funding Provided as of May 2005", "paragraphs": ["We currently estimate that the cost to complete the construction of the  CVC project, including proposed additions to its scope, is about $522  million without any allowance for risks and uncertainties. Of this amount,  $483.7 million has been provided to date. In November 2004, we estimated  that the cost to complete the scope of work approved at that time was  likely to be about $515 million, without an allowance for risks and  uncertainties. Since November 2004, AOC and the U.S. Capitol Police have  proposed about $7 million in scope changes that we included in our  current estimate, bringing it to $522 million. However, the project  continues to face risks and uncertainties, such as unforeseen conditions,  scope gaps and changes, and possible further delays. To provide for these,  we estimated in November 2004 that an additional $44 million would likely  be needed, bringing our estimate of the total cost to about $559 million.  We continue to believe that this estimate of the project\u2019s total costs is  appropriate. We have not increased our allowance for risks and  uncertainties in response to the recent requests for $7 million in scope  changes because we consider such changes among the risks and  uncertainties that the project faced in November.", "Over the years, CVC construction costs have increased considerably. Most  of these costs were outside or largely outside AOC\u2019s control, but other  costs were more within its control. About $147 million of the cost increase  was due to changes in the project\u2019s scope, many of which were for security  enhancements following September 11 and the anthrax attacks in October  2001. Congress added the House and Senate expansion spaces and the  Library of Congress tunnel to the project\u2019s scope after the original  project\u2019s cost was estimated; similarly, the Department of Defense  recommended and funded an air filtration system for the facility. Other  factors also outside or largely outside AOC\u2019s control contributed about $45  million to the increase. For example, bid prices for the sequence 1 and 2  contracts exceeded budgeted costs, and unforeseen field conditions, such  as underground obstructions, necessitated additional work. Finally,  factors more within AOC\u2019s control accounted for about $58 million of the  expected additional project costs. For example, the project experienced  significant delays during sequence 1, and we expect AOC will incur  additional costs in the future because we believe the sequence 2 work will  not be done by AOC\u2019s September 2006 completion date; slow decision- making by AOC also contributed to higher costs.", "In its fiscal year 2006 budget request, AOC asked Congress for an  additional $36.9 million for CVC construction. AOC believes this amount  will be sufficient to complete the project\u2019s construction and, if approved,  will bring the total funding provided for the project to $520.6 million.  AOC\u2019s request includes the $4.2 million for potential additions to the  project\u2019s scope (e.g., congressional seals, an orientation film, and  backpack storage space), but does not include $1.7 million for the air  filtration system\u2014-an amount that AOC thought it would not need and  returned to DOD, but that we believe AOC will still likely need. AOC  believes that it could obtain these funds from DOD if needed. Thus, with a  $1.7 million increase for the air filtration system, the total estimated cost  to complete the project\u2019s construction would be the $522.3 million cited  above without provision for risks and uncertainties.", "To continue to move the project forward, Congress will have to consider  the additional funding AOC has requested for fiscal year 2006 to complete  the project, including the $4.2 million in additional scope items. Through  effective risk mitigation, as we have recommended, and effective  implementation of our other recommendations for enhancing schedule  and contract management, AOC may be able to avoid some of the $44  million that we allowed for risks and uncertainties. However, given the  project\u2019s complexity and the additional requests for funds already made  and anticipated, we believe AOC will likely need much of this $44 million  even with effective implementation of our recommendations. Already, it  appears that AOC may need additional funds for sequence 2 changes in  fiscal year 2005. For example, as of April 30, 2005, AOC had identified  proposed changes to the sequence 2 contract that it considered necessary  and expected to cost about $13.8 million. This sum is about $700,000 less  than the $14.5 million AOC has available during fiscal year 2005 for  sequence 2 changes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Worker Safety Issues", "paragraphs": ["Because the number of construction workers at the CVC site is soon  expected to increase significantly, worker safety will continue to be an  important issue during the remainder of the project. Our review of worker  safety issues found that the construction management contractor\u2019s  monthly CVC progress reports contained some inaccurate data for key  measures of worker safety, including injuries and illnesses and lost time.  For example, the contractor reported 3 lost-time incidents for 2004, but  our analysis identified 45 such incidents. These inaccuracies resulted in  both overstatements and understatements of rates. For instance, the  contractor reported a rate of 6.3 injuries and illnesses for April 2004,  whereas our analysis identified 12.5. The construction management  contractor attributed the inaccuracies to key data missing from its  calculations, unawareness of a formula change that began in 2002,  mathematical errors, and poor communication with the major  construction contractors.", "According to our analysis, the rates for injuries and illnesses and for lost  time were higher for CVC than for comparable construction sites. For  2003, the injury and illness rate was about 50 percent higher, and the lost- time rate was about 160 percent higher. Additionally, both the numbers  and the rates for injuries and illnesses and for lost time worsened from  2003 to 2004. For example, the injury and illness rate increased from 9.1 in  2003 to 12.2 in 2004, and the lost-time rate increased from 8.1 to 10.4. AOC  and its contractors have taken some actions to promote and manage safety  on the site, such as conducting monthly safety audits and making  recommendations to improve safety. However, at the time of our review,  neither AOC nor its construction management contractor had analyzed the  results of the monthly safety audits to identify trends or concerns, and  neither had reviewed the safety audit findings in conjunction with the  injury and illness data. Our analysis of key safety audit data for the first 10  months of 2004 identified about 700 safety concerns, the most frequent of  which was inadequate protection against falls. Furthermore, AOC had not  fully exercised its authority to have the contractors take corrective actions  to address recurring safety concerns.", "We recommended that, to improve safety and reporting, AOC ensure the  collection and reporting of accurate injury and illness and lost-time data,  work with its contractors to develop a mechanism for analyzing the data  and identifying corrective actions, and more fully exercise its authority to  take appropriate enforcement actions when warranted. AOC agreed with  our recommendations and initiated corrective actions. However, follow-up  work that we did in early 2005 at AOC\u2019s request indicated the corrective  actions had not yet fully eliminated errors in reporting. AOC agreed that  continued action on our recommendations was essential."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reporting to Congress", "paragraphs": ["Both AOC and its construction management contractor prepare monthly  progress reports on CVC.
