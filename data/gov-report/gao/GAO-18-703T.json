In addition, one of the  cybersecurity requirements directs agencies to ensure that the CIO works  closely with an integrated team of senior executives, including those with  expertise in IT, security, and privacy, to implement appropriate risk  management measures.", "In June 2018, we issued a report that examined the cybersecurity  workforce of the government. We noted that most of the 24 agencies we  examined had developed baseline assessments to identify cybersecurity  personnel within their agencies that held certifications, but the results  were potentially unreliable. However, SSA\u2019s baseline was found to be  reliable because it addressed all of the reportable information, such as  the extent to which personnel without professional certifications were  ready to obtain them or strategies for mitigating any gaps. Further, we  found that most of the 24 agencies had established procedures to assign  cybersecurity codes to positions, including SSA. We also have ongoing  work at SSA, including reviewing its cybersecurity workforce;  standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and  continuous monitoring; cybersecurity strategy; and intrusion detection and  prevention capabilities.", "From July 2011 through January 2018, we issued a number of reports  that addressed specific weaknesses in SSA\u2019s management of IT  acquisitions and operations and in the role of its CIO. These reports  included 15 recommendations aimed at improving the agency\u2019s efforts  with regard to data center consolidation, incremental development, IT  acquisitions, and software licenses.

OMB established the Federal Data  Center Consolidation Initiative in February 2010 to improve the  efficiency, performance, and environmental footprint of federal data  center activities. The enactment of FITARA in 2014 codified and  expanded the initiative. In addition, pursuant to FITARA, in August  2016, the Federal CIO issued a memorandum that announced the  Data Center Optimization Initiative as a successor effort to the  Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative. Further, in August 2016,  OMB released guidance which established the Data Center  Optimization Initiative and included instructions on how to implement  the date center consolidation and optimization provisions of FITARA.  Among other things, the guidance required agencies to consolidate  inefficient infrastructure, optimize existing facilities, improve their  security posture, and achieve cost savings.", "In addition, the guidance directed agencies to develop a data center  consolidation and optimization strategic plan that defines the agency\u2019s  data center strategy for fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018. This  strategy is to include, among other things, a statement from the  agency CIO indicating whether the agency has complied with all data  center reporting requirements in FITARA. Further, the guidance  indicates that OMB is to maintain a public dashboard to display  consolidation-related cost savings and optimization performance  information for the agencies.", "In a series of reports that we issued from July 2011 through August  2017, we noted that, while data center consolidation could  potentially save the federal government billions of dollars,  weaknesses existed in agencies\u2019 data center consolidation plans and  data center optimization efforts. Specifically with regard to SSA, in  2011, we reported that the agency had an incomplete consolidation  plan and inventory of IT assets. In 2016, we reported that SSA did not  meet any of the seven applicable data center optimization targets, as  required by OMB. In addition, in 2017, we reported that the agency  had an incomplete data center optimization plan. We stressed that  until SSA completed these required activities, it might not be able to  consolidate data centers, as required, and realize expected savings.", "We made a total of four recommendations to SSA in our 2011, 2016,  and 2017 reports to help improve the agency\u2019s reporting of data  center-related cost savings and to achieve data center optimization  targets. As of September 2018, SSA had implemented all four  recommendations. Consequently, the agency is better positioned to  improve the efficiency of its data centers and achieve cost savings.", "In addition, we reported in May 2018 that the agencies participating  in the Data Center Optimization Initiative had communicated mixed  progress toward achieving OMB\u2019s goals for closing data centers by  September 2018. With regard to SSA, we noted that the agency had  not yet achieved its planned savings but that its data centers were  among the most optimized that we reviewed. In particular, while SSA  reported that it planned to save $1.08 million on its data center  initiative from 2016 through 2018, it had not achieved any of those  savings. However, the agency reported having met the goal of closing  25 percent of its tiered data centers.", "Further, SSA reported the most progress among the 22 applicable  agencies in meeting OMB\u2019s data center optimization targets.  Specifically, SSA reported that it had met four of the five targets. (One  other agency reported that it had met three targets, 6 agencies  reported having met either one or two targets, and 14 agencies  reported meeting none of the targets). Consequently, we did not make  any additional recommendations to SSA in our May 2018 report. We  also have ongoing work involving SSA related to agencies\u2019 progress  on closing data center and achieving optimization targets.", "Incremental development. OMB has emphasized the need to deliver  investments in smaller parts, or increments, in order to reduce risk,  deliver capabilities more quickly, and facilitate the adoption of  emerging technologies. In 2010, it called for agencies\u2019 major  investments to deliver functionality every 12 months and, since 2012,  every 6 months. Subsequently, FITARA codified a requirement that  covered agency CIOs certify that IT investments are adequately  implementing incremental development, as defined in the capital  planning guidance issued by OMB. Further, subsequent OMB  guidance on the law\u2019s implementation, issued in June 2015, directed  agency CIOs to define processes and policies for their agencies to  ensure that they certify that IT resources are adequately implementing  incremental development.", "In November 2017, we reported that 21 agencies, including SSA,  needed to improve their certification of incremental development.  We pointed out that, as of August 2016, agencies had reported that  103 of 166 major IT software development investments (62 percent)  were certified by the agency CIO for implementing adequate  incremental development in fiscal year 2017, as required by FITARA.", "With regard to SSA, we noted that only 3 of the agency\u2019s 10  investments primarily in development had been certified by the  agency CIO as using adequate incremental development, as required  by FITARA. In addition, we noted that SSA\u2019s incremental development  certification policy did not describe the CIO\u2019s role in the certification  process or how CIO certification would be documented. However,  accurate agency CIO certification of the use of adequate incremental  development for major IT investments is critical to ensuring that  agencies are making the best effort possible to create IT systems that  add value while reducing the risks associated with low-value and  wasteful investments.", "As a result of these findings, we recommended that SSA ensure that  its CIO (1) reports major IT investment information related to  incremental development accurately, in accordance with OMB  guidance; and (2) updates the agency\u2019s policy and processes for the  certification of incremental development and confirm that the policy  includes a description of how the CIO certification will be documented.  SSA agreed with our recommendations and implemented both of  them. Thus, the agency should be better positioned to realize the  benefits of incremental development practices, such as reducing  investment risk, delivering capabilities more rapidly, and permitting  easier adoption of emerging technologies.", "IT acquisitions. FITARA includes a provision to enhance covered  agency CIOs\u2019 authority through, among other things, requiring agency  heads to ensure that CIOs review and approve IT contracts. OMB\u2019s  FITARA implementation guidance expanded upon this aspect of the  legislation in a number of ways. Specifically, according to the  guidance, CIOs may review and approve IT acquisition strategies and  plans, rather than individual IT contracts, and CIOs can designate  other agency officials to act as their representatives.", "In January 2018, we reported that most of the CIOs at 22 selected  agencies, including SSA, were not adequately involved in reviewing  and approving billions of dollars of IT acquisitions. In particular, we  found that SSA\u2019s process to identify IT acquisitions for CIO review did  not involve the acquisition office, as required by OMB. In addition, we  noted that SSA had a CIO review and approval process in place that  fully satisfied the requirements set forth in OMB\u2019s guidance. However,  while SSA provided evidence of the CIO\u2019s review of most of the IT  contracts we examined, the agency had not ensured that the CIO or a  designee reviewed and approved each IT acquisition plan or strategy.  Specifically, of 10 randomly selected IT contracts that we examined at  SSA, 7 acquisitions associated with those contracts had been  reviewed and approved, as required by OMB.", "We pointed out that, until SSA ensured that its CIO or designee  reviewed and approved all IT acquisitions, the agency would have  limited visibility and input into its planned IT expenditures and would  not be effectively positioned to benefit from the increased authority  that FITARA\u2019s contract approval provision is intended to provide.", "Further, the agency could miss an opportunity to strengthen the CIO\u2019s  authority and the oversight of IT acquisitions\u2014thus, increasing the  potential to award IT contracts that are duplicative, wasteful, or poorly  conceived.", "Accordingly, we made three recommendations to SSA to address  these weaknesses. As of September 2018, the agency had made  progress by implementing two of the recommendations: to ensure that  (1) the acquisition office is involved in identifying IT acquisitions and  (2) the CIO or designee reviews and approves IT acquisitions  according to OMB guidance. By taking these actions, SSA should be  better positioned to properly identify and provide oversight of IT  acquisitions.", "However, SSA has not yet implemented our third recommendation  that it issue guidance to assist in the identification of IT acquisitions.  SSA stated that, in September 2017, it updated its policy for  acquisition plan approval to address this recommendation; however,  upon review of this policy, we did not find guidance for identifying IT  acquisitions. Without the proper identification of IT acquisitions, SSA\u2019s  CIO cannot effectively provide oversight of these acquisitions.", "Software licenses. Federal agencies engage in thousands of  software licensing agreements annually. The objective of software  license management is to manage, control, and protect an  organization\u2019s software assets. Effective management of these  licenses can help avoid purchasing too many licenses, which can  result in unused software, as well as too few licenses, which can  result in noncompliance with license terms and cause the imposition  of additional fees.", "As part of its PortfolioStat initiative, OMB has developed policy that  addresses software licenses. This policy requires agencies to  conduct an annual, agency-wide IT portfolio review to, among other  things, reduce commodity IT spending. Such areas of spending could  include software licenses.", "In May 2014, we reported on federal agencies\u2019 management of  software licenses and determined that better management was  needed to achieve significant savings government-wide. Of the 24  agencies we reviewed, SSA was 1 of 22 that lacked comprehensive  policies that incorporated leading practices.", "In particular, SSA\u2019s policy partially met four of the leading practices  and did not meet one. Further, we noted that SSA was among 22 of  the 24 selected agencies that had not established comprehensive  software license inventories\u2014a leading practice that would help the  agencies to adequately manage their software licenses.", "As such, we made six recommendations to SSA to improve its  policies and practices for managing software licenses. These included  recommendations that the agency develop a comprehensive policy for  the management of software licenses and establish a comprehensive  inventory of software licenses. SSA agreed with the recommendations  and, as of September 2018, had implemented all six of them.

For  example, CIOs are required to develop and maintain an agency-wide  security program, policies, procedures, and control techniques.", "In our August 2018 report, we noted that SSA, along with 23 other  agencies, did not have policies that fully addressed the role of the CIO in  these six key areas, consistent with the laws and guidance.", "To its credit, SSA had fully addressed the role of the CIO in the IT  leadership and accountability area. In particular, the agency\u2019s policies  addressed the requirements that the CIO report directly to the agency  head, assume responsibility and accountability for IT investments, and  designate a senior agency information security officer.", "However, the policies did not fully address the role of the CIO in the other  five areas (i.e., strategic planning, workforce, budgeting, investment  management, and information security). For example, the agency\u2019s  policies did not address the IT workforce area at all, including the  requirements that the CIO annually assess the extent to which agency  personnel meet IT management knowledge and skill requirements,  develop strategies to address deficiencies, and report to the head of the  agency on the progress made in improving these capabilities.", "Further, SSA\u2019s policies minimally addressed the requirements for IT  strategic planning. Specifically, while the agency\u2019s policies required the  CIO to establish goals for improving agency operations through IT, the  policies did not require the CIO to measure how well IT supports agency  programs and report annually on the progress in achieving the goals.", "Table 1 summarizes the extent to which SSA\u2019s policies addressed the  role of its CIO, as reflected in our August 2018 report.", "As a result of these findings, we made a recommendation to SSA to  address the weaknesses in its policies with regard to the remaining five  key management areas. In response, the agency agreed with our  recommendation and, subsequently, stated that it planned to do so by the  end of September 2018.
