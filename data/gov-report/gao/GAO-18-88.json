According to CMS officials, this broader program-integrity approach can help the agency develop control activities to address multiple sources of improper payments, including fraud. As the figure below shows, CMS views fraud as part of a spectrum of actions that may result in improper payments.", "CMS's efforts managing fraud risks in Medicare and Medicaid partially align with GAO's 2015 A Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs (Fraud Risk Framework). This framework describes leading practices in four components: commit , assess , design and implement , and evaluate and adapt . CMS has shown commitment to combating fraud in part by establishing a dedicated entity\u2014the Center for Program Integrity\u2014to lead antifraud efforts. Furthermore, CMS is offering and requiring antifraud training for stakeholder groups such as providers, beneficiaries, and health-insurance plans. However, CMS does not require fraud-awareness training on a regular basis for employees, a practice that the framework identifies as a way agencies can help create a culture of integrity and compliance. Regarding the assess and design and implement components, CMS has taken steps to identify fraud risks, such as by designating specific provider types as high risk and developing associated control activities. However, it has not conducted a fraud risk assessment for Medicare or Medicaid, and has not designed and implemented a risk-based antifraud strategy. A fraud risk assessment allows managers to fully consider fraud risks to their programs, analyze their likelihood and impact, and prioritize risks. Managers can then design and implement a strategy with specific control activities to mitigate these fraud risks, as well as an appropriate evaluation approach consistent with the evaluate and adapt component. By developing a fraud risk assessment and using that assessment to create an antifraud strategy and evaluation approach, CMS could better ensure that it is addressing the full portfolio of risks and strategically targeting the most-significant fraud risks facing Medicare and Medicaid."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS (1) provide and require fraud-awareness training to its employees, (2) conduct fraud risk assessments, and (3) create an antifraud strategy for Medicare and Medicaid, including an approach for evaluation.

For  example, in 2015 a Michigan oncologist was sentenced for submitting $34  million in fraudulent claims to Medicare and private insurance companies  for administering medically unnecessary chemotherapy to 553 patients.  Every year, the federal government investigates hundreds of fraud cases  involving CMS programs and during fiscal year 2016 won or negotiated  about $2.5 billion in health-care fraud judgments and settlements as a  result of federal investigations and prosecutions.", "According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), annual mandatory  outlays for CMS\u2019s four principal programs\u2014Medicare, Medicaid, the  Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the health-insurance  marketplaces\u2014total about $1.1 trillion.

We interviewed all national contractors that we identified as  most directly involved in CMS\u2019s antifraud and program-integrity efforts;  there were six such contractors. We also interviewed six regional CMS  contractors. We identified six types of regional CMS antifraud and  program-integrity contractors, and interviewed one of each type. We  selected these contractors to achieve a mix of companies holding each  type of regional contract (some companies hold more than one type of  contract), and to ensure geographic diversity of the areas they serve. We  also interviewed officials from one national and one regional private  health-insurance plan. We chose these two plans because they are  among larger plans that provide Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial  services. We chose one large regional and one national health-insurance  plan to obtain a diversity of perspectives.", "In addressing our second objective, we evaluated CMS\u2019s efforts against  the four components of the Fraud Risk Framework: (1) commit to  combating fraud by creating an organizational culture and structure  conducive to fraud risk management; (2) plan regular fraud risk  assessments and assess risks to determine a fraud risk profile; (3) design  and implement strategy with specific control activities to mitigate  assessed fraud risks and collaborate to help ensure effective  implementation; and (4) evaluate outcomes using a risk-based approach  and adapt activities to improve fraud risk management. In doing so, we  reviewed agency documents and information obtained from interviews  that enabled us to compare CMS\u2019s antifraud efforts against each of these  components.

Fraud  risk exists when individuals have an opportunity to engage in fraudulent  activity, have an incentive or are under pressure to commit fraud, or are  able to rationalize committing fraud. When fraud risks can be identified  and mitigated, fraud may be less likely to occur.", "Although the occurrence of one or more cases of health-care fraud  indicates there is a fraud risk, a fraud risk can exist even if fraud has not  yet been identified or occurred.

Officials told us that when CPI began operating, its  primary focus was developing program integrity for Medicare FFS and, as  a result, it is the most \u201cmature\u201d of all of CPI\u2019s programs. CMS\u2019s specific  fraud control activities include, for example, the Fraud Prevention System  (FPS), a predictive-analytics system that helps identify potentially  fraudulent payments in Medicare FFS, and the Unified Program Integrity  Contractors (UPIC), which detect and investigate aberrant provider  behavior and potential fraud in Medicare and Medicaid. Other control  activities serve broader program-integrity purposes such as to reduce  improper payments resulting from error, waste, and abuse in addition to preventing or detecting potential fraud.

Each state  has its own Medicaid program-integrity unit, Medicaid Fraud Control Unit  (MFCU), and state audit organization.", "CMS also uses numerous contractors to conduct the majority of its  program-integrity activities. Since the enactment of Medicare in 1965,  contractors have played an integral role in the administration of the  program. The original Medicare program was designed so that the federal  government contracted with health insurers or similar organizations  experienced in handling physician and hospital claims to pay Medicare  claims. Later, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of  1996 required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to enter into  contracts to promote the integrity of the Medicare program. According to  CMS officials, in fiscal year 2016 contractors received 92 percent of  CMS\u2019s program-integrity funding. Medicare and Medicaid program- integrity contractors play a variety of roles: (1) processing and reviewing  claims, (2) conducting site visits of providers enrolling in Medicare, (3)  auditing claims and recovering overpayments, (4) performing data  analysis, and (5) investigating aberrant claims and provider behaviors,  among other things. States also use contractors in many of these roles for  managing program integrity.", "Additionally, multiple private health-insurance plans in Medicare Parts C  and D and over 200 health-insurance plans in Medicaid managed care  also carry out program-integrity activities. For the health-insurance  marketplaces, CMS is responsible for operating the federally facilitated  marketplace and overseeing the state-based marketplaces. CMS also  developed the Federal Data Services Hub, which acts as a portal for  exchanging information between state-based marketplaces, the federally  facilitated marketplace, and state Medicaid agencies, among other  entities, as well as other external partners, including other federal  agencies, such as the Internal Revenue Service. Finally, law- enforcement groups, including the joint Department of Justice (DOJ) and  HHS OIG Medicare Fraud Strike Force Teams, identify, investigate, and  prosecute instances of fraud in CMS programs.

For oversight, CMS creates policies and guidance to  direct stakeholders\u2019 antifraud efforts, such as Medicare and Medicaid  program-integrity manuals and the Medicaid Provider Enrollment  Compendium. CMS also provides technical assistance to states in  areas such as provider enrollment and data analysis. In areas where  CMS does not have a primary role, it acts as a partner by collaborating  and coordinating program-integrity and antifraud activities. For example,  CMS is directly responsible for Medicare program integrity, but, in  Medicaid and CHIP, states are the first line of program-integrity efforts.  Similarly, CMS maintains control over Medicare FFS program integrity,  but within Medicare managed care, it provides guidance for health- insurance plans to carry out their own program-integrity activities.", "In the health-insurance marketplaces, CMS reviews state-based  marketplaces\u2019 procedures for verifying applicant eligibility for coverage.

According to CMS, as of October 2017, the HFPP  included 89 public and private partners, including Medicare- and  Medicaid-related federal and state agencies, law-enforcement agencies,  private health-insurance plans (payers), and antifraud and other health- care organizations. The HFPP has conducted studies that pool and  analyze multiple payers\u2019 claims data to identify providers with patterns of  suspect billing across payers.

While some relationships between CMS and stakeholders  have been long-standing, some are developing, and others exist on an ad  hoc basis. For example, CMS has had a long-standing relationship with  state Medicaid program-integrity units, by collaborating through monthly  meetings of the Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Technical Advisory Group,  sending fraud alerts, and offering courses through the Medicaid Integrity  Institute. However, in our interviews with state program-integrity units,  and as we recently reported, some state Medicaid agencies shared  concerns about the communication, level of policy guidance, and  technical support provided by and received from CMS for managing fraud  risks in Medicaid. This concern was echoed by state audit officials, with  whom CMS recently initiated coordination to build relationships that would  facilitate state auditing of Medicaid programs.", "CMS also has varying relationships with its law-enforcement partners. For  example, the relationship between CMS and DOJ\u2019s Health Care Fraud  unit, which leads the DOJ and HHS OIG Medicare Fraud Strike Force  Teams, has been ad hoc. According to CMS and DOJ officials, the  interactions between the agencies have been based on specific fraud  cases such as coordination of national takedowns when DOJ provided  CMS with the names of providers committing fraud so that CMS could  suspend them consistently with the timing of the enforcement efforts.

CPI chairs the meetings  and typically develops meeting agendas to solicit information from and  disseminate information to other CMS units or stakeholders. Further, the  board may establish small working groups, known as integrated project  teams, to address specific vulnerabilities. For example, according to CMS  officials, in 2016 the board established a Marketplace integrated project  team to resolve potential fraud eligibility and enrollment issues in the  federally facilitated marketplace using the Fraud Risk Framework.", "CPI has further demonstrated commitment to addressing fraud, waste,  and abuse through several organizational changes with the goal of  improving coordination and communication of program-integrity activities  across Medicare and Medicaid. Most recently, in 2014, CPI reorganized  its structure to align functional areas across Medicare and Medicaid,  where possible. Previously, separate units within CPI administered their  own program-integrity activities for Medicare and Medicaid programs. For  example, CPI established a Provider Enrollment and Oversight Group,  responsible for provider screening and enrollment functions in both  Medicare and Medicaid.

According to CMS  officials, the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) account,  one of the primary sources of CPI funding, has never received a funding  reduction. Additionally, in 2015, CPI received additional funding based on  a discretionary cap adjustment to HCFAC. Similarly, CPI staff resources have increased over time. According to CMS, CPI\u2019s full-time equivalent  positions increased from 177 in 2011 to 419 in 2017.", "Consistent with leading practices in the Fraud Risk Framework to involve  all levels of the agency in setting an antifraud tone, CPI has also worked  collaboratively with other CMS Centers. In addition to engaging  executive-level officials of other CMS Centers through the Program  Integrity Board, CPI has worked collaboratively with other Centers within  CMS to incorporate antifraud features into new program design or policy  development and established regular communication at the staff level.  For example:", "Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI). When  developing the Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program, CMMI  officials told us they worked with CPI\u2019s Provider Enrollment and  Oversight Group and Governance Management Group to develop  risk-based screening procedures for entities that would enroll in  Medicare to provide diabetes-prevention services, among other  activities. The program was expanded nationally in 2016, and CMS  determined that an entity may enroll in Medicare as a program  supplier if it satisfies enrollment requirements, including that the  supplier must pass existing high categorical risk-level screening  requirements.", "Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS). CMCS officials told  us they worked closely with CPI to issue Medicaid guidance and best  practices to states on home and community-based services that  incorporate program-integrity provisions. A senior CMCS official told  us that, to address fraud, CMS has requested that states include  provider information on claims to determine whether providers are  meeting eligibility criteria.", "Center for Medicare (CM). In addition to building safeguards into  programs and developing policies, CM officials told us that there are  several standing meetings, on monthly, biweekly, and weekly bases,  between groups within CM and CPI that discuss issues related to  provider enrollment, FFS operations, and contractor management. A  senior CM official also told us that there are ad hoc meetings taking  place between CM and CPI: \u201cWe interact multiple times daily at  different levels of the organization. Working closely is just a regular  part of our business.\u201d", "CMS has also demonstrated its commitment to addressing fraud, waste,  and abuse to its stakeholders. Representatives of CMS\u2019s extensive  stakeholder network whom we interviewed\u2014state officials, contractors,  and officials from public and private entities\u2014generally recognized the  agency\u2019s commitment to combating fraud. In our interviews with  stakeholders, officials observed CMS\u2019s increased commitment over time  to address fraud, waste, and abuse and cited examples of specific CMS  actions. State officials, for example, told us that the Medicaid Integrity  Institute, a training center coordinated jointly by CMS and DOJ, has been  a helpful resource for states to build capacity to address fraud and  program integrity. CMS contractors told us that CMS\u2019s commitment to  combating fraud is incorporated into contractual requirements, such as  requiring (1) data analysis for potential fraud leads and (2) fraud-  awareness training for providers. Officials from entities that are members  of the HFPP, specifically, a health-insurance plan and the National Health  Care Anti-Fraud Association, added that CMS\u2019s effort to establish the  HFPP and its ongoing collaboration and information sharing reflect CMS\u2019s  commitment to combat fraud in Medicare and Medicaid.", "The Fraud Risk Framework identifies training as one way of  demonstrating an agency\u2019s commitment to combating fraud. Training and  education intended to increase fraud awareness among stakeholders,  managers, and employees, serves as a preventive measure to help  create a culture of integrity and compliance within the agency. The Fraud  Risk Framework discusses requiring all employees to attend training upon  hiring and on an ongoing basis thereafter.", "To increase awareness of fraud risks in Medicare and Medicaid, CMS  offers and requires training for stakeholder groups such as providers,  beneficiaries, and health-insurance plans. Specifically, through its  National Training Program and Medicare Learning Network, CMS makes  available training materials on combating Medicare and Medicaid fraud,  waste, and abuse. These materials help to identify and report fraud,  waste, and abuse in CMS programs and are geared toward providers,  beneficiaries, as well as trainers and other stakeholders. Separately,  CMS requires health-insurance plans working with CMS to provide annual  fraud, waste, and abuse training to their employees.", "However, CMS does not offer or require similar fraud-awareness training  for the majority of its workforce. For a relatively small portion of its overall  workforce\u2014specifically, contracting officer representatives who are  responsible for certain aspects of the acquisition function\u2014CMS requires  completion of fraud and abuse prevention training every 2 years.  According to CMS, 638 of its contracting officer representatives (or about  10 percent of its overall workforce) completed such training in 2016 and  2017. Although CMS offers fraud-awareness training to others, the  agency does not require fraud-awareness training for new hires or on a  regular basis for all employees because the agency has focused on  providing process-based internal controls training for its employees.", "While fraud-awareness training for contracting officer representatives is  an important step in helping to promote fraud risk management, fraud- awareness training specific to CMS programs would be beneficial for all  employees. Such training would not only be consistent with what CMS  offers to or requires of its stakeholders and some of its employees, but  would also help to keep the agency\u2019s entire workforce continuously aware  of fraud risks and examples of known fraud schemes, such as those  identified in successful OIG investigations. Such training would also keep  employees informed as they administer CMS programs or develop  agency policies and procedures. Considering the vulnerability of Medicare  and Medicaid programs to fraud, waste, and abuse, without regular  required training CMS cannot be assured that its workforce of over 6,000  employees is continuously aware of risks facing its programs.", "Although CMS has shown commitment to combating fraud, at times CPI\u2019s  efforts to combat fraud compete with other mission priorities, such as (1)  ensuring beneficiary access to health-care services and (2) limiting  provider burden. CPI leadership has been aware of this inherent  challenge. For example, at a congressional hearing in May 2016, CPI\u2019s  Director stated that \u201cour efforts strike an important balance: protecting  beneficiary access to necessary health care services and reducing the  administrative burden on legitimate providers and suppliers, while  ensuring that taxpayer dollars are not lost to fraud, waste, and abuse.\u201d", "Beneficiary access to care. In accordance with its mission statement,  providing and improving beneficiaries\u2019 access to health care is a CMS  priority. CMS\u2019s commitment to providing access to high-quality care and  coverage is reflected in the agency\u2019s mission statement and is one of its  four strategic goals. As a result, before taking administrative actions  against a Medicare Part A provider, such as a hospice, or providers in  rural areas, CMS officials told us that they first look at whether there is a  sufficient number of providers in an area by running a provider search by  provider county and adjacent counties and considering how heavily  populated an area is with Medicare beneficiaries. According to these  officials, rather than taking an administrative action against a provider that  would limit beneficiaries\u2019 access to services, the agency may enter into a  corrective action plan with the provider. CMS officials told us that revoking  a provider\u2019s enrollment in Medicare, an option available to CMS in cases  of provider noncompliance or misconduct, is rare.", "Administrative burden on providers. According to CMS documents and  officials, concern over placing undue burden on providers\u2014the majority of  whom are presumed to be honest\u2014provides a counterforce to  implementing program-integrity control activities. CMS\u2019s web page  entitled Reducing Provider Burden states: \u201cCMS is committed to reducing  improper payments but must be mindful of provider burden because  medical review is a resource-intensive process for both the healthcare  provider and the Medicare review contractor.\u201d Two CMS contractors told  us that they scaled back or did not pursue audits of providers\u2019  documentation because of provider burden or sensitivity considerations.  One contractor removed providers from audit samples after some  providers opposed having to supply multiple medical records. CPI officials  told us that they want to reduce provider burden in a logical manner. For  example, according to CMS officials, in the Medicare FFS Recovery Audit  Program, CMS established limits on Additional Documentation Requests,  which are requests for medical documentation supporting a claim being  reviewed. CMS requires such documentation adjustments so that they  align with a providers\u2019 claim denial rates. Providers with low denial rates  will have lower documentation requirements, while providers with high  denial rates will have higher documentation requirements, thus adjusting  provider burden based on demonstrated compliance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CMS Has Taken Steps to Identify Program Fraud Risks but Has Not Conducted a Fraud Risk Assessment for Medicare or Medicaid", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CMS Has Taken Steps to Identify Some Fraud Risks for Medicare and Medicaid", "paragraphs": ["The assess component of the Fraud Risk Framework calls for federal  managers to plan regular fraud risk assessments and to assess risks to  determine a fraud risk profile.

As discussed earlier,  CMS officials told us that CPI initially focused on developing control  activities for Medicare FFS and considers these activities to be the most  mature of all CPI efforts to address fraud risks. CMS has identified fraud  risks in the following selected examples, which are not an exhaustive list  of its control activities.", "Data analytics to assist investigations in Medicare FFS. In 2011, CMS  implemented FPS, a data-analytic system that screens all Medicare FFS  claims to identify health-care providers with suspect billing patterns for  further investigation. Medicare FFS contractors\u2014ZPICs and UPICs\u2014 have used FPS to identify and prioritize leads for investigations of  potential fraud by high-risk Medicare FFS providers. Contractors told us  that FPS allows them to quickly identify and triage leads. CMS\u2019s guidance  requires contractors to prioritize investigations with the greatest program  impact or urgency and identifies required criteria for prioritizing  investigations, such as patient abuse or harm, multistate fraud, and high  dollar amount of potential overpayments. One contractor we interviewed  developed a risk-prioritization model that incorporated CMS\u2019s required  criteria, such as patient harm, as well as additional criteria, such as  provider spikes in billing, into a tool that automatically creates a provider  risk score to help the contractor focus and prioritize investigative  resources.", "Prior authorization for Medicare FFS services or supplies. CMS published  a final rule in December 2015 that identifies a master list of durable  medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies for which CMS  can require prior authorization before suppliers submit a Medicare FFS  claim. In this rule, CMS identified 135 items that are frequently subject to  unnecessary utilization and stated that the agency expects the final rule  to result in savings in the form of reduced unnecessary utilization, fraud,  waste, and abuse. Under this program, prior authorization is a condition  of payment for claims. CMS can choose which items on the master list to  subject to prior authorization. For example, in March 2017, it began  requiring prior authorization for selected power wheelchairs in four states  and expanded the prior authorization program for these items to all states  in July 2017.", "CMS also began to test the use of prior authorization on a voluntary basis  through a series of fixed-length demonstrations for items and services  that have been associated with high levels of improper payments,  including high incidences of fraud in some cases, and unnecessary  utilization in certain geographic areas. For example, CMS began  implementing a voluntary prior authorization demonstration in September  2012 for other power mobility devices, such as power scooters, in seven  states where historically there has been extensive evidence of fraud and  improper payments. CMS expanded the demonstration to an additional  12 states in October 2014, for a total of 19 states. According to the initial  Federal Register notice, CMS planned to use the demonstration to  develop improved methods for investigation and prosecution of fraud to  protect federal funds from fraudulent actions and the resulting improper  payments. Under the demonstration, providers and suppliers are  encouraged\u2014but not required\u2014to submit a request for prior authorization  for certain items before they provide the item to the beneficiary and  submit a claim for payment.", "Revised provider screening and enrollment processes for Medicare FFS  and Medicaid FFS. In response to PPACA, in 2011 CMS implemented a  revised screening process for providers and suppliers who enroll in  Medicare and Medicaid based on identified provider risk categories.  CMS placed all Medicare provider and supplier types into one of three  risk categories\u2014limited, moderate, or high\u2014based on its assessment of  the potential risk of fraud, waste, and abuse each provider and supplier  type poses. For example, CMS designated prospective (newly enrolling)  home health agencies and prospective suppliers of durable medical  equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies in the high-risk category.  According to the final rule and our interviews with CMS officials, CMS  developed these risk-based categories based on its review and synthesis  of various information sources about the fraud risks posed by each  provider and supplier type, including (1) the agency\u2019s experience with  claims data used to identify potentially fraudulent billing practices, (2)  expertise of contractors responsible for investigating and identifying  Medicare fraud, and (3) GAO and OIG reports. CMS designated specific  screening activities for each risk category, with increased requirements  for moderate- and high-risk provider and supplier types. For example,  moderate- and high-risk providers and suppliers must receive  preenrollment site visits, and high-risk providers and suppliers also are  subject to fingerprint-based criminal-background checks. As part of the  revised screening process, beginning in September 2011, CMS also  undertook its first program-wide effort to rescreen, or revalidate, the  enrollment records of about 1.5 million existing Medicare FFS providers  and suppliers, to determine whether they remain eligible to bill  Medicare.", "Temporary provider enrollment moratoriums for certain providers and  geographic areas for Medicare FFS and Medicaid FFS. CMS identified  certain provider types and geographic areas as high risk for fraud and  used its authority under PPACA to implement temporary moratoriums to  suspend enrollment of such Medicare and Medicaid providers in those  areas. For example, in July 2016, CMS extended temporary moratoriums  statewide on the enrollment of new Medicare Part B nonemergency  ambulance suppliers and Medicare home health agencies statewide in six  states, as applicable. The statewide moratoriums also apply to  Medicaid. According to the Federal Register notice, CMS imposed the  temporary moratoriums based on qualitative and quantitative factors  suggesting a high risk of fraud, waste, or abuse, such as law-enforcement  expertise with emerging fraud trends and investigations. CMS\u2019s data  analysis also confirmed the agency\u2019s determination of a high risk of fraud,  waste, and abuse for these provider and supplier types within certain  geographic areas, according to the notice.", "Medicaid state program integrity reviews and desk reviews. CMS tailored  state Medicaid program-integrity reviews to areas it identified as high risk  for improper payments, such as personal care services, which may also  be at high risk for fraud. In March 2017, we reported that, from fiscal  years 2014 through 2016, CMS conducted focused reviews of state  program-integrity efforts in 31 states, reviewing 10 or 11 states annually.  For each state, CMS tailored its focused reviews to the state\u2019s managed  care plans and relevant other high-risk areas, including provider  enrollment and screening, nonemergency medical transportation, and  personal care services. CMS and state officials we spoke with as part of  that work told us that the tailored oversight had been beneficial and  helped identify areas for improvement. CMS has also initiated desk  reviews of state program-integrity efforts. According to CMS, these desk  reviews allow the agency to provide states with customized program- integrity oversight.", "Vulnerability tracking system for Medicare. CPI recently initiated an effort  to centralize and formalize a vulnerability tracking process for Medicare,  which could support identification of specific fraud risks, both in Medicare  and possibly Medicaid.

The standards state that, as part of this overall assessment, management  should consider the potential for fraud when identifying, analyzing, and  responding to risks.", "The Fraud Risk Framework states that, in planning the fraud risk  assessment, effective managers tailor the fraud risk assessment to the  program by, among other things, identifying appropriate tools, methods,  and sources for gathering information about fraud risks and involving  relevant stakeholders in the assessment process. Fraud risk  assessments that align with the Fraud Risk Framework involve (1)  identifying inherent fraud risks affecting the program, (2) assessing the  likelihood and impact of those fraud risks, (3) determining fraud risk  tolerance, (4) examining the suitability of existing fraud controls and  prioritizing residual fraud risks, and (5) documenting the results.

Such a risk assessment would provide  the detailed information and insights needed to create a fraud risk profile,  which, in turn, is the basis for creating an antifraud strategy.", "According to CMS officials, CMS has not conducted a fraud risk  assessment for Medicare or Medicaid because, within CPI\u2019s broader  approach of preventing and eliminating improper payments, its focus has  been on addressing specific vulnerabilities among provider groups that  have shown themselves particularly prone to fraud, waste, and abuse.  With this approach, however, it is unlikely that CMS will be able to design  and implement the most-appropriate control activities to respond to the  full portfolio of fraud risks.", "A fraud risk assessment consists of discrete activities that build upon  each other. Specifically:  Identifying inherent fraud risks affecting the program. As discussed  earlier, CMS has taken steps to identify fraud risks. However, CMS  has not used a process to identify inherent fraud risks from the  universe of potential vulnerabilities facing Medicare and Medicaid  programs, including threats from various sources. According to CPI  officials, most of the agency\u2019s fraud control activities are focused on  fraud risks posed by providers. The Fraud Risk Framework discusses  fully considering inherent fraud risks from internal and external  sources in light of fraud risk factors such as incentives, opportunities,  and rationalization to commit fraud. For example, according to CMS  officials, the inherent design of the Medicare Part C program may  pose fraud risks that are challenging to detect. A fraud risk  assessment would help CMS identify all sources of fraudulent  behaviors, beyond threats posed by providers, such as those posed  by health-insurance plans, contractors, or employees.", "Assessing the likelihood and impact of fraud risks and determining  fraud risk tolerance. CMS has taken steps to prioritize fraud risks in  some areas, but it has not assessed the likelihood or impact of fraud  risks or determined fraud risk tolerance across all parts of Medicare  and Medicaid. Assessing the likelihood and impact of inherent fraud  risks would involve consideration of the impact of fraud risks on  program finances, reputation, and compliance. Without assessing the  likelihood and impact of risks in Medicare or Medicaid or internally  determining which fraud risks may fall under the tolerance threshold,  CMS cannot be certain that it is aware of the most-significant fraud  risks facing these programs and what risks it is willing to tolerate  based on the programs\u2019 size and complexity.", "Examining the suitability of existing fraud controls and prioritizing  residual fraud risks. CMS has not assessed existing control activities  or prioritized residual fraud risks. According to the Fraud Risk  Framework, managers may consider the extent to which existing  control activities\u2014whether focused on prevention, detection, or  response\u2014mitigate the likelihood and impact of inherent risks and  whether the remaining risks exceed managers\u2019 tolerance. This  analysis would help CMS to prioritize residual risks and to determine  mitigation approaches. For example, CMS has not established  preventive fraud control activities in Medicare Part C. Using a fraud  risk assessment for Medicare Part C and closely examining existing  fraud control activities and residual risks, CMS could be better  positioned to address fraud risks facing this growing program and  develop preventive control activities. Further, without assessing  existing fraud control activities and prioritizing residual fraud risks,  CMS cannot be assured that its current control activities are  addressing the most-significant risks. Such analysis would also help  CMS determine whether additional, preferably preventive, fraud  controls are needed to mitigate residual risks, make adjustments to  existing control activities, and potentially scale back or remove control  activities that are addressing tolerable fraud risks.", "Documenting the risk-assessment results in a fraud risk profile. CMS  has not developed a fraud risk profile that documents key findings and  conclusions of the fraud risk assessment. According to the Fraud Risk  Framework, the risk profile can also help agencies decide how to  allocate resources to respond to residual fraud risks. Given the large  size and complexity of Medicare and Medicaid, a documented fraud  risk profile could support CMS\u2019s resource-allocation decisions as well  as facilitate the transfer of knowledge and continuity across CMS staff  and changing administrations.", "Senior CPI officials told us that the agency plans to start a fraud risk  assessment for Medicare and Medicaid after it completes a separate  fraud risk assessment of the federally facilitated marketplace. This fraud  risk assessment for the federally facilitated marketplace eligibility and  enrollment process is being conducted in response to a recommendation  we made in February 2016. In April 2017, CPI officials told us that this  fraud risk assessment was largely completed, although in September  2017 CPI officials told us that the assessment was undergoing agency  review. CPI officials told us that they have informed CM and CMCS  officials that there will be future fraud risk assessments for Medicare and  Medicaid; however, they could not provide estimated timelines or plans  for conducting such assessments, such as the order or programmatic  scope of the assessments.", "Once completed, CMS could use the federally facilitated marketplace  fraud risk assessment and apply any lessons learned when planning for  and designing fraud risk assessments for Medicare and Medicaid.  According to the Fraud Risk Framework, factors such as size, resources,  maturity of the agency or program, and experience in managing risks can  influence how the entity plans the fraud risk assessment. Additionally,  effective managers tailor the fraud risk assessment to the program when  planning for it. The large scale and complexity of Medicare and Medicaid  as well as time and resources involved in conducting a fraud risk  assessment underscore the importance of a well-planned and tailored  approach to identifying the assessment\u2019s programmatic scope. Planning  and tailoring may involve decisions to conduct a fraud risk assessment for  Medicare and Medicaid programs as a whole or divided into several  subassessments to reflect their various component parts (e.g., Medicare  FFS, Medicaid managed care) as well as determining the timing and  order of assessments (e.g., concurrently or consecutively for Medicare  and Medicaid).", "CMS\u2019s existing fraud risk identification efforts as well as communication  channels with stakeholders could serve as a foundation for developing a  fraud risk assessment for Medicare and Medicaid. The leading practices  identified in the Fraud Risk Framework discuss the importance of  identifying appropriate tools, methods, and sources for gathering  information about fraud risks and involving relevant stakeholders in the  assessment process. CMS\u2019s fraud risk identification efforts discussed  earlier could provide key information about fraud risks and their likelihood  and impact. Further, existing relationships and communication channels  across CMS and its extensive network of stakeholders could support  building a comprehensive understanding of known and potential fraud  risks for the purposes of a fraud risk assessment. For example, the fraud  vulnerabilities identified through data analysis and information sharing  with states, health-insurance plans, law-enforcement organizations, and  contractors through the HFPP could inform a fraud risk assessment.

However, according to CMS officials, these objectives were identified  from discussions with CMS leadership and various stakeholders and not  through a fraud risk assessment process to identify inherent fraud risks  from the universe of potential vulnerabilities, as described earlier and  called for in the leading practices. These strategic objectives were  presented at an antifraud conference in 2016, but were not announced  publicly until the release of the Annual Report to Congress on the  Medicare and Medicaid Integrity Programs for Fiscal Year 2015 in June  2017.", "Stakeholder relationships and communication. CMS has established  relationships and communicated with stakeholders, but, without an  antifraud strategy, stakeholders we spoke with lacked a common  understanding of CMS\u2019s strategic approach. Prior work on practices that  can help federal agencies collaborate effectively calls for a strategy that is  shared with stakeholders to promote trust and understanding. Once an  antifraud strategy is developed, the Fraud Risk Framework calls for  managers to collaborate to ensure effective implementation. Although some CMS stakeholders were able to describe various CMS program- integrity priorities and activities, such as home health being a fraud risk  priority, the stakeholders could not communicate, articulate, or cite a  common CMS strategic approach to address fraud risks in its programs.", "Incentives. The Fraud Risk Framework discusses creating incentives to  help ensure effective implementation of the antifraud strategy once it is  developed. Currently, some incentives within stakeholder relationships  may complicate CMS\u2019s antifraud efforts. As discussed earlier, CMS is a  partner and provides oversight to states\u2019 program-integrity functions.  Officials from one state told us that they were reluctant to share their  program vulnerabilities because CMS would use this information to later  audit the state. Among contractors, CMS encourages information sharing  through conferences and workshops; however, competition for CMS  business among contractors can be a disincentive to information sharing.  CMS officials acknowledged this concern and said that they expect  contractors to share information related to fraud schemes, outcomes of  investigations, and tips for addressing fraud, but not proprietary  information such as algorithms to risk-score providers.", "Without developing and documenting an antifraud strategy based on a  fraud risk assessment, as called for in the design and implement  component of the Fraud Risk Framework, CMS cannot ensure that it has  a coordinated approach to address the range of fraud risks and to  appropriately target and allocate resources for the most-significant risks.  Considering fraud risks to which the Medicare and Medicaid programs are  most vulnerable, in light of the malicious intent of those who aim to exploit  the programs, would help CMS to examine its current control activities  and potentially design new ones with recognition of fraudulent behavior it  aims to prevent. This focus on fraud is distinct from a broader view of  program integrity and improper payments by considering the intentions  and incentives of those who aim to deceive rather than well-intentioned  providers who make mistakes. Also, continued growth of the programs,  such as growth of Medicare Part C and Medicaid managed care, call for  consideration of preventive fraud control activities across the entire  network of entities involved.", "Further, considering the large size and complexity of Medicare and  Medicaid and the extensive stakeholder network involved in managing  fraud in the programs, a strategic approach to managing fraud risks within  the programs is essential to ensure that a number of existing control  activities and numerous stakeholder relationships and incentives are  being aligned to produce desired results. Once developed, an antifraud  strategy that is clearly articulated to various CMS stakeholders would help  CMS to address fraud risks in a more coordinated and deliberate fashion.  Thinking strategically about existing control activities, resources, tools,  and information systems could help CMS to leverage resources while  continuing to integrate Medicare and Medicaid program-integrity efforts  along functional lines. A strategic approach grounded in a comprehensive  assessment of fraud risks could also help CMS to identify future  enhancements for existing control activities, such as new preventive  capabilities for FPS or additional fraud factors in provider enrollment and  revalidation, such as provider risk scoring, to stay in step with evolving  fraud risks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Has Established Monitoring and Evaluation Mechanisms That Could Inform a Risk-Based Antifraud Strategy for Medicare and Medicaid", "paragraphs": ["The evaluate and adapt component of the Fraud Risk Framework calls for  federal managers to evaluate outcomes using a risk-based approach and  adapt activities to improve fraud risk management.

We have previously reported that agencies may  face challenges measuring outcomes of fraud risk management activities  in a reliable way. These challenges include the difficulty of measuring the  extent of deterred fraud, isolating potential fraud from legitimate activity or  other forms of improper payments, and determining the amount of  undetected fraud. Despite these challenges, CMS has taken steps to  estimate a fraud baseline\u2014meaning the rate of probable fraud\u2014in the  home health benefit. In fiscal year 2016, CMS conducted a pretest in the  Miami-Dade area of Florida to evaluate its potential measurement  approach that could later be used in a nationwide study of probable fraud  among home health agencies. The pretest was not a random sample and was not intended to produce a rate of fraud, but instead was intended to  test the interview instruments and data-collection methodology CMS  might use in a study nationwide. CMS and its contractor collected  information from home health agencies, the attending providers, and  Medicare beneficiaries in the Miami-Dade area in order to test these  interview instruments. CMS completed this pretest, but, according to CMS  officials, the agency does not yet have plans to roll out a nationwide study  that would estimate a probable fraud rate for the Medicare FFS home  health benefit.", "In its 2015 annual report to Congress, CMS stated that \u201cdocumenting the  baseline amount of fraud in Medicare is of critical importance, as it allows  officials to evaluate the success of ongoing fraud prevention activities.\u201d  CMS officials working on the pilot told us that having an estimate of the  rate of fraud in home health benefits would allow CMS to reliably assess  its efforts at eliminating or reducing fraud. Without a baseline, officials  said, the agency cannot know whether its antifraud efforts are as effective  as they could be. We previously reported that the lack of a baseline for  the amount of health-care fraud that exists limits CMS\u2019s ability to  determine whether its activities are effectively reducing health care fraud  and abuse. A baseline estimate could provide an understanding of the  extent of fraud and, with additional information on program activities,  could help to inform decision making related to allocation of resources to  combat health-care fraud.", "As described in the Fraud Risk Framework, in the absence of a fraud  baseline, agencies can gather additional information on the short-term or  intermediate outcomes of some antifraud initiatives, which may be more  readily measured. For example, CMS has developed some performance  measures to provide a basis for monitoring its progress towards meeting  the program-integrity goals set in the HHS Strategic Plan and Annual  Performance Plan. Specifically, CMS measures whether it is meeting its  goal of \u201cincreasing the percentage of Medicare FFS providers and  suppliers identified as high risk that receive an administrative action.\u201d  CMS does not set specific antifraud goals for other parts of Medicare or  Medicaid; other CMS performance measures relate to measuring or  reducing improper payments in CHIP, Medicaid, and the various parts of  Medicare.", "CMS uses return-on-investment and savings estimates to measure the  effectiveness of its Medicare program-integrity activities and FPS. For  example, CMS uses return-on-investment to measure the effectiveness of  FPS and, in response to a recommendation we made in 2012, CMS  developed outcome-based performance targets and milestones for FPS.  CMS has also conducted individual evaluations of its program-integrity  activities, such as an interim evaluation of the prior-authorization  demonstration for power mobility devices that began in 2012 and is  currently implemented in 19 states.", "Commensurate with greater maturity of control activities in Medicare FFS  compared to other parts of Medicare and Medicaid, monitoring and  evaluation activities for Medicare Parts C and D and Medicaid are more  limited. For example, CMS calculates savings for its program-integrity  activities in Medicare Parts C and D, but not a full return-on-investment.  CMS officials told us that calculating costs for specific activities is  challenging because of overlapping activities among contractors. CMS  officials said they continue to refine methods and develop new savings  estimates for additional program-integrity activities.", "According to the Fraud Risk Framework, effective managers develop a  strategy and evaluate outcomes using a risk-based approach. In  developing an effective strategy and antifraud activities, managers  consider the benefits and costs of control activities. Ongoing monitoring  and periodic evaluations provide reasonable assurance to managers that  they are effectively preventing, detecting, and responding to potential  fraud. Monitoring and evaluation activities can also support managers\u2019  decisions about allocating resources, and help them to demonstrate their  continued commitment to effectively managing fraud risks.", "As CMS takes steps to develop an antifraud strategy, it could include  plans for refining and building on existing methods such as return-on- investment or savings measures, and setting appropriate targets to  evaluate the effectiveness of all of CMS\u2019s antifraud efforts. Such a  strategy would help CMS to efficiently allocate program-integrity  resources and to ensure that the agency is effectively preventing,  detecting, and responding to potential fraud. For example, while doing so  would involve challenges, CMS\u2019s strategy could detail plans to advance  efforts to measure a potential fraud rate through baseline and periodic  measures. Fraud rate measurement efforts could also inform risk  assessment activities, identify currently unknown fraud risks, align  resources to priority risks, and develop effective outcome metrics for  antifraud controls. Such a strategy would also help CMS ensure that it  has effective performance measures in place to assess its antifraud  efforts beyond those related to providers in Medicare FFS, and establish  appropriate targets to measure the agency\u2019s progress in addressing fraud  risks.", "As CMS makes plans to move forward with a strategy and to further  develop evaluation and monitoring mechanisms, it will be important to  share its efforts with stakeholders. The Fraud Risk Framework states that  effective managers communicate lessons learned from fraud risk  management activities to stakeholders. For example, CMS could be a  leader to states in measuring the effectiveness of program-integrity  efforts. Officials in three of the four states we spoke with expressed  interest in receiving CMS guidance on how to measure the effectiveness  of their Medicaid program-integrity efforts, such as by providing models  for how to calculate return-on-investment."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Medicare and Medicaid provide health insurance to over 129 million  Americans, but the size\u2014in terms of number of beneficiaries and amount  of expenditures\u2014as well as complexity of these programs make them  inherently susceptible to fraud and improper payments. CMS currently  manages these risks across its programs as part of a broader approach  to identifying and controlling for multiple sources of improper payments  and by developing relationships with an extensive network of  stakeholders. In Medicare and Medicaid specifically, we note that CMS  has taken many important steps toward implementing a strategic  approach for managing fraud. However, the agency could benefit by more  fully aligning its efforts with the four components of the Fraud Risk  Framework.", "CMS is well positioned to leverage its fraud risk management efforts\u2014 such as demonstrated leadership for combating fraud, existing control  activities, and stakeholder relationships\u2014to provide additional antifraud  training, as well as to develop an antifraud strategy based on fraud risk  assessments for Medicare and Medicaid. We recognize that the effort  may be challenging, given the size and complexity of Medicare and  Medicaid, and the need to balance antifraud activities with CMS\u2019s other  mission priorities. However, by not employing the actions identified in the  Fraud Risk Framework and incorporating them in its approach to  managing fraud risks, CMS is missing a significant opportunity to better  ensure employee vigilance against fraud, and to organize and focus its  many antifraud and program-integrity activities and related resources into  a comprehensive strategy.
