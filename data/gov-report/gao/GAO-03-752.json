Among possible terrorist targets are the nation's nuclear power plants--104 facilities containing radioactive fuel and waste. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) oversees plant security through an inspection program designed to verify the plants' compliance with security requirements. As part of that program, NRC conducted annual security inspections of plants and force-on-force exercises to test plant security against a simulated terrorist attack. GAO was asked to review (1) the effectiveness of NRC's security inspection program and (2) legal challenges affecting power plant security. Currently, NRC is reevaluating its inspection program. We did not assess the adequacy of security at the individual plants; rather, our focus was on NRC's oversight and regulation of plant security."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["NRC has taken numerous actions to respond to the heightened risk of terrorist attack, including interacting with the Department of Homeland Security and issuing orders designed to increase security and improve plant defensive barriers. However, three aspects of its security inspection program reduced NRC's effectiveness in overseeing security at commercial nuclear power plants. First, NRC inspectors often used a process that minimized the significance of security problems found in annual inspections by classifying them as \"non-cited violations\" if the problem had not been identified frequently in the past or if the problem had no direct, immediate, adverse consequences at the time it was identified. Non-cited violations do not require a written response from the licensee and do not require NRC inspectors to verify that the problem has been corrected. For example, guards at one plant failed to physically search several individuals for metal objects after a walk-through detector and a hand-held scanner detected metal objects in their clothing. The unchecked individuals were then allowed unescorted access throughout the plant's protected area. By making extensive use of non-cited violations for serious problems, NRC may overstate the level of security at a power plant and reduce the likelihood that needed improvements are made. Second, NRC does not have a routine, centralized process for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating security inspections to identify problems that may be common to plants or to provide lessons learned in resolving security problems. Such a mechanism may help plants improve their security. Third, although NRC's force-on-force exercises can demonstrate how well a nuclear plant might defend against a real-life threat, several weaknesses in how NRC conducted these exercises limited their usefulness. Weaknesses included using (1) more personnel to defend the plant during these exercises than during a normal day, (2) attacking forces that are not trained in terrorist tactics, and (3) unrealistic weapons (rubber guns) that do not simulate actual gunfire. Furthermore, NRC has made only limited use of some available improvements that would make force-on-force exercises more realistic and provide a more useful learning experience. Even if NRC strengthens its inspection program, commercial nuclear power plants face legal challenges in ensuring plant security. First, federal law generally prohibits guards at these plants from using automatic weapons, although terrorists are likely to have them. As a result, guards at commercial nuclear power plants could be at a disadvantage in firepower, if attacked. Second, state laws vary regarding the permissible use of deadly force and the authority to arrest and detain intruders, and guards are unsure about the extent of their authorities and may hesitate or fail to act if the plant is attacked."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and  the Pentagon intensified the nation\u2019s focus on national preparedness and  homeland security.

As part of the  security inspection program, NRC conducts annual security inspections of  plants and conducts force-on-force exercises. During the security  inspections, NRC reviews (1) the list of those who have access to the plant,  (2) the plant\u2019s response to an unusual security event, (3) any changes to the  security plan, and (4) samples of the plant\u2019s own assessment of its security.  Since 1991, the inspection program has also included periodic force-on- force exercises, which are designed to simulate an attack on the plant that  is based on the design basis threat.

Before granting an operating license, NRC must  approve a security plan for the plant.

Details of the design basis threat are  considered \u201csafeguards information\u201d and are restricted from public  dissemination. The design basis threat characterizes the elements of a  postulated attack, including the number of attackers, their training, and the  weapons and tactics they are capable of using. The design basis threat,  revised twice since it was first issued in 1977, requires the plants to protect  against \u201ca determined violent external assault by stealth, or deceptive  actions\u201d or \u201can internal threat of an insider, including an employee in any  position.\u201d  Under the 1977 design basis threat, plants had to  add barriers to vital equipment and work zones and develop  identification and search procedures for anyone entering restricted  areas;    upgrade alarm systems and internal communication networks and  control keys, locks, and combinations; and  maintain a minimum number of guards, armed with semiautomatic  weapons, that had to be on duty at all times (unless NRC granted an  exemption that allowed fewer guards).", "In 1993, in response to the first terrorist attack on the World Trade Center  in New York City and to a vehicle intrusion at the Three Mile Island nuclear  power plant in Pennsylvania, NRC revised the design basis threat for  radiological sabotage to include the possible use of a vehicle bomb. This  action required the installation of vehicle barriers at the power plants. On  April 29, 2003, NRC issued a revised design basis threat that the  commission believes is the \u201clargest reasonable threat against which a  regulated private guard force should be expected to defend under existing  law.\u201d NRC has given the power plants 18 months to comply with the new  design basis threat.", "NRC\u2019s inspection program is an important element in its oversight effort to  ensure that commercial nuclear power plants comply with security  requirements.

On October 6, 2001, NRC issued a major advisory, stating that the  licensees should consider taking immediate action to increase the number  of security guards and to be cautious of temporary employees. NRC  conducted a three-phase security inspection, checking the licensees to see  if they had complied with these advisories. Each licensee\u2019s resident  inspector conducted phase one, which was a quick overview of the  licensee\u2019s security program using a headquarters-prepared survey. During  phase two, NRC\u2019s regional security inspectors conducted a more thorough  survey of each plant\u2019s security. During phase three, which concluded in  January 2002, NRC\u2019s regional security inspectors reviewed each licensee\u2019s  security program to determine if the licensee had complied with the  additional measures suggested in the October 6, 2001, advisory.", "NRC used the results from the three-phase security inspection in  developing its February 25, 2002, order requiring licensees to implement  additional security mechanisms.

In December 2002, NRC  completed a checklist to provide assurance that the licensees had complied  with the order. In addition, NRC developed a security inspection procedure  to validate and verify licensee compliance with all aspects of the order.  NRC estimates that this procedure will be completed by December 2003.

Commercial nuclear power plants use hundreds of temporary employees  for maintenance\u2014most frequently during the period when the plant is shut  down for refueling. In the past, NRC found instances in which personnel  who failed to report criminal records had temporary clearances that  allowed them unescorted access to vital areas.  In its October 6, 2001,  advisory, NRC suggested that licensees limit temporary clearances for  temporary workers. On February 25, 2002, NRC issued an order that limited  the use and duration of temporary clearances, and, on January 7, 2003, NRC  issued an order to eliminate the use of these clearances.

Second, NRC does not  routinely collect and disseminate information from security inspections to  NRC headquarters, other NRC regions, or other power plants.  Dissemination of this information may help other plants to correct similar  problems or prevent them from occurring.

NRC does not expect a new  security inspection program to be implemented until some time in 2004.  Although NRC has temporarily suspended its annual security inspections, it  continues to check a plant\u2019s self-assessments and conduct an inspection if  the licensee identifies a serious problem.", "Under the previous security inspection program, initiated in 1999 and  suspended in 2001, NRC used a \u201crisk informed\u201d performance-based system  (the Reactor Oversight Process) that was intended to focus both NRC\u2019s and  the licensees\u2019 resources on important safety matters. In an attempt to focus  NRC attention on plants with the most serious problems, and to reduce  regulatory burdens on the nuclear industry, the Reactor Oversight Process  relied heavily on performance assessment data generated by the licensees  and submitted quarterly to NRC. In the security area, these licensee self- assessments provided NRC with data on (1) the operation of security  equipment (such as intrusion detectors and closed-circuit television  cameras), (2) the effectiveness of the personnel screening program  (including criminal history and background checks), and (3) the  effectiveness of the employee fitness-for-duty program (including tests for  substance abuse and behavioral observations). Under guidelines for these  self-assessments, licensees are required to report only the most serious  problems. NRC inspectors followed a multistep process to monitor  security, including verifying the licensees\u2019 self-assessments and conducting  their own annual inspection. NRC inspectors did not verify all aspects of  the licensees\u2019 self-assessments. Instead, the inspectors made random  checks of the quarterly self-assessments during their annual security  inspection of the plant.", "During the inspections, the inspectors reviewed the following aspects of  security at each plant:   Access authorization and fitness for duty (performed annually).", "Inspectors interviewed supervisors and their staffs about procedures for  recognizing drug use, possession, and sale; indications of alcohol use  and aberrant behavior; and records of testing for suspicious behavior.  These procedures were designed to ensure that the licensee conducts  adequate personnel screening and enforces fitness-for-duty  requirements\u2014functions considered critical to protect against an  insider threat of radiological sabotage.", "Access control (performed annually). Inspectors observed guards at  entry points during peak hours, checked screening equipment, read  event reports and logs, checked access procedures for the plant\u2019s vital  area, and surveyed data in the security computers. For example,  inspectors observed searches of personnel, packages, and vehicles for  contraband (i.e., firearms, explosives, or drugs) before entry into the  protected area and ensured that the guards granted only authorized  persons unescorted access to the protected and the vital areas of the  plant.", "Response to contingency events (performed triennially). Inspectors  tested the licensee\u2019s physical security by testing the intrusion detection  system.", "Random checks of changes to security plans (performed biennially).", "Under NRC regulations, licensees can change their security plans  without informing NRC if they believe that the change does not decrease  the effectiveness of the plan. Inspectors reviewed security plan changes  and could have physically examined a change if an issue arose.", "If NRC inspectors detected a security problem in these areas, they  determined the problem\u2019s safety significance and whether it violated the  plant\u2019s security plan or other NRC requirements. If a violation occurred,  and the inspectors determined that the problem was \u201cmore than minor,\u201d  they used a \u201csignificance determination process\u201d to relate the violation to  overall plant security. According to NRC officials, the significance  determination process is also being revised. Under the process previously  used, the inspectors assigned a violation one of the following four ratings:  very low significance, low to moderate significance, substantial  significance, and high significance. For violations more serious than very  low significance, the licensee was required to prepare a written response,  stating the actions it would take to correct the problem. However,  violations judged to be of very low significance\u2014usually categorized as  non-cited violations\u2014were routinely recorded; entered into the plant\u2019s  corrective action plan; and, from NRC\u2019s perspective, closed. Violations  were judged to be of low significance and categorized as a non-cited  violation if the problem had not been identified more than twice in the past  year or if the problem had no direct, immediate, adverse consequences at  the time it was identified. In addition, for non-cited violations, NRC did not  require a written response from the licensee and did not routinely follow up  to ensure that a permanent remedy had been implemented unless the non- cited violation was randomly selected for review of the licensee\u2019s  corrective action program.", "We found that NRC frequently issued non-cited violations. NRC issued 72  non-cited security violations from 2000 to 2001 compared with no cited  security violations during the same period. In addition, NRC issued non- cited violations for security problems that, while within NRC\u2019s guidance for  non-cited violations, appear to be serious and seem to justify the formality  and follow-up of a cited violation. For example:  At one plant, an NRC inspector found a security guard sleeping on duty  for more than half an hour. This incident was treated as a non-cited  violation because no actual attack had occurred during that time, and  because neither he nor any other guard at the plant had been found  sleeping more than twice during the past year.", "At another plant, a security officer falsified logs to show that he had  checked vital area doors and barriers when he was actually in another  part of the plant. The officer was the only protection for this area  because of a \u201csecurity upgrade project.\u201d", "At another plant, NRC inspectors categorized two security problems as  non-cited violations because they had not occurred more than twice in  the past year. In one incident, an inspector observed guards who failed  to physically search several individuals for metal objects after a walk- through detector and a hand-held scanner detected metal objects in  their clothing. The unchecked individuals were then allowed unescorted  access throughout the plant\u2019s protected area. Also, security was  compromised in a vital area\u2014where equipment that could be required  to protect public health and safety is located\u2014when an inspector found  that tamper alarms on an access door had been disabled. In this case,  the only compensatory measure implemented was to have a guard  check the location once during each 12-hour shift.", "In addition to NRC\u2019s annual inspections, NRC will conduct an inspection if  a plant\u2019s quarterly self-assessment identifies a serious security problem.  Between 2000 and 2002, only 4 of the 104 plants reported security problems  that required NRC to conduct a follow-up inspection. In 2000, each plant  identified that equipment for controlling access to the plant\u2019s protected  area was often broken, requiring extra guards as compensation. None of  the 104 plants\u2019 self-assessments identified any security problems in 2001,  2002, or the first 6 months of 2003.", "Once every 3 months, NRC develops performance summaries for each of  the nuclear power plants it regulates. In the security area, NRC uses each  plant\u2019s self-assessment performance indicators and its own annual  inspections as the basis for each plant\u2019s quarterly rating. The performance  rating can range from \u201cmeeting security objectives\u201d to \u201cunacceptable.\u201d The  ratings are displayed on NRC\u2019s Web site, which is the public\u2019s main link to  NRC\u2019s assessment of the security at each plant. However, because of NRC\u2019s  extensive use of non-cited violations, the performance rating may not  always accurately represent the security level of the plant.

As a  result, according to NRC officials, during the exercises, many plants  increased the number of guards that would respond to an attack; added  security barriers, such as additional fencing; and/or added defensive  positions that they did not previously have. According to our review of all  80 OSRE reports, at least 45\u2014or 56 percent\u2014of the exercises were  conducted against plant defenders who had received additional training for  the exercise or against enhanced plant security features, such as additional  guards or defensive positions or barriers.

However, of the 35 plants that used only the security levels specified in the  security plan, 19 (or 54 percent) failed to defeat the attackers in one or  more exercises conducted during the OSRE.", "The increased training and preparation for the OSRE exercises provided an  opportunity for the licensee to examine its security program and upgrade  the program in areas found lacking. However, according to an NRC official,  the licensee could decrease security to previous levels after the exercise.  Consequently, the exercise only provided an evaluation of the \u201cramped up\u201d  security and provided little information on the plant\u2019s normal day-to-day  security. According to this official, NRC could not hold a licensee  accountable for ramping down after the OSRE exercise because the  enhanced training and additional barriers were not part of the licensee\u2019s  security plan, and NRC can only hold the licensee accountable for its  security plan. NRC has not required that security enhancements  implemented to prepare for OSRE exercises be included as part of the  plants\u2019 security plans.

Federal law generally prohibits private  ownership of automatic weapons, and there is no exemption in the law for  security guards at commercial nuclear power plants. As a result, no  nuclear power plants use automatic weapons in their defense. However,  terrorists attacking a nuclear power plant could be armed with automatic  weapons or other advanced weapons. NRC officials believe that a terrorist  attacking a nuclear power plant could obtain and use any weapon that can  be purchased on the black market, while guards generally have to rely on  semiautomatic pistols, rifles, or shotguns. As a result, guards at nuclear  power plants could be at a great disadvantage in terms of firepower, if  attacked.", "According to NRC officials, the use of fully automatic weapons would  provide an important option to plants as they make security decisions  about a number of factors, such as the number of plant guards, the  positioning of guards at the facilities, and the quality and capabilities of  surveillance equipment. According to these officials, plants will have more  options in developing the appropriate combination of security elements if  guards have the authority to carry automatic weapons. NRC recognizes,  however, that some plant sites face special conditions under which fully  automatic weapons might not be beneficial or practicable.", "Commercial nuclear power plants also face security challenges because of  the absence of nationwide legal authority and clear guidance on when and  how guards can use deadly force in defending these plants. According to  NRC\u2019s regulations, a guard should use deadly force in protecting nuclear  power reactors against sabotage when the guard has a reasonable belief  that such force is necessary for self-defense or the defense of others.  However, in general, state laws govern the use of deadly force by private  sector persons, and these laws vary from state to state. For example, under  New Hampshire statutes, guards may not use deadly force if they can safely  retreat from the encounter. In contrast, Texas statutes allow guards to use  deadly force in defense of private land or property, which includes nuclear  power plants, without retreating, if such action is necessary to protect  against another\u2019s use of unlawful force. In still other states, such as  Virginia and Michigan, no state statutes specifically address the issue, and  the courts decide whether deadly force was appropriate in a given  situation.", "NRC officials believe that guards\u2014concerned about their right to act\u2014 might second-guess, hesitate, delay, or fail to act appropriately against an  attacker, thereby increasing the risk of a successful attack on the nation\u2019s  nuclear power plants. During OSRE exercises, NRC officials presented  guards with various scenarios that could involve the use of deadly force. In  7 of the 80 OSRE reports we reviewed (about 9 percent) NRC found that  the guards did not understand or did not properly apply its guidance on the  use of deadly force.", "Finally, guards at nuclear power plants do not have nationwide legal  authority and clear guidance on when and how to arrest and/or detain  intruders at the nation\u2019s plants. NRC officials believe that there is a  question about whether federal authority can be directly granted to private  security guards who are not deputized. State laws governing this authority  vary. For example, in South Carolina, private security guards\u2019 authority to  arrest and/or detain intruders on plant property is similar to local law  enforcement officials\u2019 authority. However, in most states, these guards  have only the arrest authority afforded every U.S. citizen.", "To enable nuclear power plants to better defend against attacks, NRC has  sought federal legislation that would authorize the use of deadly force to  protect the plants.

However, NRC\u2019s past methods for  ensuring that plants are taking all of the appropriate defensive measures\u2014 the annual security inspections and the force-on-force exercises\u2014had  significant weaknesses. As a result, NRC\u2019s oversight of these plants may not  have provided the information necessary for NRC to ensure that the power  plants were adequately defended.", "In particular, NRC\u2019s past use of non-cited violations for security problems  that appear to be serious is detrimental to ensuring the plants\u2019 security  because NRC did not require follow-up to ensure that a non-cited violation  was corrected. Lack of follow-up reduces the likelihood that needed  improvements will be made. Moreover, NRC may have overstated security  levels when it provided a \u201cmeeting security objectives\u201d rating to some  plants having non-cited violations that appear to have serious security  implications. NRC could not have known whether some non-cited  violations, such as guards found asleep on duty or failure to physically  search for metal detected by scanners, were vulnerabilities that could have  been exploited. However, accepting such vulnerabilities post-September  11, 2001, opens the power plants to undue risk. Furthermore, NRC may be  missing opportunities to better oversee and improve security at the plants  because it does not routinely collect, analyze, and disseminate information  on security enhancements, problems, and solutions among the plants and  within the agency. Such a mechanism may help other plants to improve  their security.", "Similarly, the force-on-force exercises were not realistic enough to ensure  the identification and correction of plants\u2019 security vulnerabilities.  Untrained adversary teams, temporarily enhanced defenses, and rubber  weapons used in past force-on-force exercises simply do not compare with  simulated attack exercises using technologically advanced tools that  provide realistic, real-time experience. Furthermore, NRC was not required  to conduct these exercises and has done so infrequently, thereby making  plants even less prepared to address an attack. In addition, in the past,  exercises have not addressed the full range of the design basis threat.  Finally, delays in issuing reports on the OSRE exercises may have resulted  in delays in the permanent correction of known security problems.", "NRC is in the process of revising both its security inspection program and  its force-on-force exercise program. What these programs will consist of  when they are revised is currently unknown. NRC expects its security  inspection program to be restored by 2004 and will decide the future of its  force-on-force program after completing its pilot program\u2014at a date yet to  be determined. Revisions of these programs provide NRC with an  opportunity to use the lessons learned from the suspended programs to  strengthen them and make them more relevant to the post-September 11,  2001, environment.", "Until these programs are restored, NRC is relying on plants\u2019 self- assessments and the force-on-force pilot program as its mechanisms to  oversee security at the nation\u2019s nuclear power plants. The self-assessments  rely on the licensees to identify problems, which then prompts NRC to  conduct security inspections. Since the inspection program was curtailed  in 2001, the plants have not identified any serious security problems in their  self-assessments.

NRC  stated that our report did not provide a balanced or useful perspective of its  role in ensuring security at commercial nuclear power plants. NRC  believed that our report was \u201cof a historical nature,\u201d focusing on NRC\u2019s  oversight of power plants before September 11, 2001, and that our report  failed to reflect the changes NRC has made to its program since September  11. Furthermore, NRC commented that our characterization of non-cited  violations as minimizing the significance of security problems is a serious  misrepresentation. NRC said that the \u201canecdotal\u201d issues noted in the draft  report were \u201crelatively minor issues\u201d and that it treated them appropriately.", "We agree that NRC has taken numerous and appropriate actions since  September 11, 2001, and that additional security procedures have been, and  are being, put in place to increase power plant operators\u2019 attention to  enhancing security. Our draft report had discussed many of these actions,  and we have added additional language to the report to more fully reflect  these actions. We note that most of these actions were advisories or  requirements for the licensee to enhance plant physical security and did  not relate to NRC\u2019s oversight activities. With respect to NRC oversight of  security at the nuclear power plants, NRC has suspended the two primary  elements of its oversight program, the security inspection program and the  OSRE exercises and has not yet resumed them. NRC\u2019s oversight actions  since September 11 have been interim in nature; it has conducted ad hoc  inspections and some force-on-force exercises as part of a pilot program.  NRC said that it plans to reinstitute the security inspection and the force- on-force exercise programs in the future, but it does not now know what  the revised programs will consist of. As a result, we remain convinced that  it was appropriate to examine NRC\u2019s security oversight program before  September 11. In the absence of any formal post-September 11 oversight  program, this was the only way to systematically assess the strengths and  weaknesses of NRC\u2019s oversight. Our recommendations are directed at  strengthening the oversight programs and making NRC\u2019s oversight more  relevant to the post-September 11 environment.", "In that regard, while the NRC comments reference numerous efforts and  enhancements, we note that, with one exception, these actions were  designed to enhance power plant security and not to improve or enhance  NRC\u2019s oversight program, which is the subject of this report. The one  exception is NRC\u2019s force-on-force evaluation program, a major element in  NRC\u2019s oversight program. In its comments, NRC stated that we failed to  adequately reflect NRC\u2019s enhanced force-on-force evaluation program,  including the increased frequency and greater degree of realism of the  exercises. We disagree. NRC has not yet instituted a new force-on-force  program, and our report reflects NRC\u2019s current force-on-force efforts. NRC  suspended its old OSRE program after September 11, 2001, and is currently  conducting pilot force-on-force exercises, which we describe in this report.  NRC has not determined when a permanent program will be instituted or  what it will consist of when it is reinstituted. NRC plans to use the results  of the pilot exercises to help formulate a new, permanent program.", "We also disagree that the \u201canecdotal\u201d issues cited in the draft report were  \u201crelatively minor issues\u201d and do not believe that the continued extensive  use of non-cited violations will achieve the best oversight. Sleeping guards,  unauthorized access to protected areas, disabled alarms in the vital area,  and failure to inspect visitors who set off alarms on metal detectors are all  serious security problems that warrant NRC attention and oversight. NRC\u2019s  belief that it should rely on the licensees to self-identify and correct these  types of problems is troubling. Instead of discounting problems that are, on  their face, quite worrisome, NRC should aggressively determine the root  cause of the problems, formulate corrective actions, and follow up to  ensure that the approved corrective actions have been implemented and  that the implemented actions have corrected the problems. The use of non- cited violations delegates these activities and responsibilities to the  licensees. NRC believes that such delegation is appropriate and that the use  of non-cited violations contributes to an environment in which the licensee  self-identifies and corrects problems, a behavior that NRC said it  encourages. However, in the cases we cited, the delegation of responsibility  for identifying and correcting security problems was not effective because  all were security problems that the licensee failed to identify, but instead  were found by NRC security inspectors.", "Finally, NRC stated that its process requires it to review a sampling of the  licensees\u2019 corrective actions to ensure that the licensees are implementing  the corrective actions. NRC failed to note, however, that the requirement  cited is part of the baseline security inspection program that was  suspended after September 11, 2001, and that has not been reinstated. In  addition, when NRC was conducting baseline security inspections, the  program required corrective action checks only every 2 years, and the  sample selected for checks included all corrective actions\u2014safety and  emergency preparedness, as well as security. As a result, NRC had no  assurance that any security corrective actions would be selected for follow- up. Licensees should be involved in identifying and correcting problems.  However, we believe that by delegating these functions to the licensee,  NRC is abandoning its oversight responsibilities and, as a result, cannot  guarantee that problems are identified and corrected.", "NRC did not comment on our recommendations for reinstituting and  improving its baseline inspection and force-on-force exercise programs.
