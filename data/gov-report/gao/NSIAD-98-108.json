The average age of the active duty C-130 fleet is over 25 years old, while the average age of the Guard and Reserve C-130s is about 15 years old. These aircraft are under the management and control of the Air Mobility Command (AMC) and are operated by the active Air Force, the Air National Guard, and the Air Force Reserve.", "The Air Force has just begun buying a new J model C-130. Lockheed Martin Corporation is developing the J aircraft as a commercial venture and expects it to (1) lower the cost of ownership of the fleet and (2) climb higher and faster, fly at higher cruise speeds, and take off and land in a shorter distance than the existing fleet. The J will have the same structural characteristics as previous C-130 models; however, it differs in that it includes, among other things, an advanced integrated digital avionics system, a new engine and composite propellers, a heads-up display, and a redesigned flight station to facilitate operation by a three-man versus a five-man crew. The J can also be bought in a stretched version.", "The aircraft is currently undergoing developmental tests and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification process is expected to end in June 1998.

While most of the current fleet is comprised of combat delivery aircraft, many of the C-130 variants perform specialized missions.", "The combat delivery C-130 fleet, designated as C-130Es and C-130Hs, is used in a wide variety of wartime and peacetime missions. In wartime, the C-130 combat delivery aircraft primarily performs the intratheater portion of the airlift mission, leaving the long-range intertheater transport mission to larger aircraft such as the C-5 and C-17. These C-130s primarily provide rapid transportation of personnel or cargo for delivery by parachute to a designated drop zone, or by landing at austere locations within the conflict area. These aircraft are also the primary aeromedical evacuation aircraft in a conflict.", "In peacetime, the combat delivery C-130 is used for training flights, regularly scheduled channel operations, and special assignment missions.It is also used in fire fighting and humanitarian relief missions. For example, it has been used to airlift heavy equipment into remote areas of other countries to build airports and roads, and transport local goods.", "In addition to the missions performed by the basic combat delivery C-130 aircraft, 11 other variants perform specialized missions. These missions include (1) weather reconnaissance, performed by the WC-130 aircraft; (2) special communication missions, performed by the EC-130 aircraft; and (3) search and rescue, performed by the HC-130 aircraft.", "The 12 different C-130 models that are currently in the fleet and their respective missions are summarized in table 1.", "Appendix III provides further details on these C-130 models.", "The Air Force plans to buy the C-130J as a one-for-one replacement of C-130Es and C-130Hs as they reach their service life. Air Force officials told us that the basic missions of the C-130 fleet will not change when the new C-130J aircraft enter the fleet. However, it appears that these missions will be expanded. Specifically, Air Force officials told us that, as part of the Air Force\u2019s planned C-130J procurement, it is planning to buy the new stretched C-130J-30. We were further told that because this aircraft will provide more room/airplane capacity, it could be used to augment intertheater missions, like strategic brigade airdrops.

Thirty of these were in the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve units and the remaining were in the active duty force.", "We were told that reductions in the active duty force structure was achieved by reclassifying some of the combat coded aircraft and designating others as ground trainers. Reductions in the Air National Guard were expected to be 24 aircraft (from 190 to 166 aircraft) and the Air Force Reserve Command units were to be reduced by 6 aircraft (from 104 to 98 aircraft). According to Air Force officials, these reductions were not made. In accordance with restrictions in the Conference Reports on the 1998 Department of Defense Appropriations Act and the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998, these reductions were not taken. Specifically, the reports recommended that the Air National Guard and the Air Force Reserve C-130 aircraft remain at current levels\u2014levels before the MSP.

The Air Force, however, appears to be making changes to improve this process.", "Air Force Instruction 16-402 governs the process for retiring aircraft. The process begins with a document called the Force Structure Plan Outlook. This document tells the commands how many aircraft are excess to requirements in a given year, usually as a result of budget constraints or a change in requirements for the fleet. Once a decision has been made to excess a certain number of aircraft, the commands are to review: (1) The aircraft\u2019s remaining service life. (2) The recent maintenance history on the aircraft. Program depot maintenance and other inspection records are reviewed, at this point, to assess whether the aircraft had a lot of corrosion problems, maintenance troubles, and/or a known history of performance problems.", "When a decision to excess a specific aircraft is finalized, Air Force headquarters is to determine whether other users\u2014that is, active duty, guard and reserves, and ultimately other agencies\u2014could use the aircraft. If other users were not identified, the aircraft should be retired.", "The Air Force has retired C-130s with service life remaining on the aircraft. Program officials told us that such retirements have generally been driven by congressional direction to buy more C-130s than the Air Force requested in its annual budget requests. Program officials told us that, accordingly, it was difficult to control the retirement of C-130 aircraft. They stated that, since retirement from the fleet had been based on congressionally directed acquisitions replacing existing C-130 aircraft, they were not retiring aircraft because the service life had expired. Of the 49 C-130s retired between June 1991 and May 1997, 36 were C-130Bs with old technology and 13 were newer C-130Es. Of the 13 C-130Es, all had an average of 14 years of service life still remaining.", "In addition, annual congressional appropriation language states that, with the exception of safety modifications, no modifications may be done if the service plans to retire an aircraft in less than 5 years after modifications. We noted that of the 49 C-130 aircraft the Air Force has retired since 1991, 40 had modifications within 5 years of retirement, totaling about $9 million. Program officials told us that it is difficult to control modifications of C-130 aircraft because the Air Force does not generally know 5 years in advance when a C-130 aircraft will leave the fleet.", "The Air Force appears to be taking steps to improve its C-130 modifications and retirement process. Specifically, in October 1997, the Vice Chief of Staff, in a message to the lead Air Force commands for C-130 aircraft, stated that additional C-130J congressional adds should be expected for fiscal year 1998 and beyond and that the commands should plan and program accordingly. Air Force officials have stated that they will incorporate this direction in the development of their C-130 retirement plan. In that regard, an AMC Tiger Team looking at the C-130 fleet has recommended to the Air Force Chief of Staff that 150 C-130Es with the worst service life problems be replaced with C-130J-30s. We were told, however, that final decisions were not expected on the retirement of the old C-130s and procurement of the Js until late fall 1998. Until these decisions are made and the plan released, it is too early to determine how well this directive will be implemented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Is the Air Force C-130J Requirement and What Other Alternatives Were Reviewed?", "paragraphs": ["As of March 1998, the Air Force had not decided how many C-130Js will be required. According to C-130 program officials, although the Air Force has a documented requirement for the C-130J as the need arises, a large-scale C-130J program is not needed at this time because the service life of the first C-130E will not expire until 2002. Accordingly, the Air Force has only been requesting one or two C-130Js per year since 1996 for the active force. As previously shown in figure 1, the remaining J acquisitions were congressionally directed buys for the Guard and Reserve.", "The Air Force began procuring the J in accordance with directions from the Air Force Chief of Staff to use fiscal year 1994 Guard and Reserve procurement funds to buy two C-130Js. Originally, the two J models were going to the active duty Air Force, which provided the Air National Guard two C-130Hs as a swap. These two J models will now be going to the Air Force Reserves at Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi, following the flight test program.", "The justification for the new C-130J buys, according to requirements, acquisition, and budget documents, is to reduce the cost of ownership of the C-130E and H fleet, with anticipated cost savings associated with the new technology and the reduced crew and maintenance needs of the J aircraft. A review of the C-130J program office\u2019s life-cycle cost estimate was completed in June 1996 by the Air Force Cost Analysis Improvement Group. The report stated that operations and support savings are forecast from a program of 135 C-130Js bought over the 1996 to 2014 time frame with the new technology and the reduced crew and maintenance needs of the J aircraft. Air Force officials, however, acknowledge that savings associated with this commercial buy will not be substantiated until several years after delivery/transfer of ownership is taken by the Air Force, which, as previously stated, is now expected in October 1998 for the first J aircraft.", "Additionally, during our review, some Air Force officials expressed concern that the normal requirements process was not followed in the recent J buys. They stated that requirement documents for the EC-130Js and WC-130Js were written after the Air Force had made a commitment to buy the aircraft. For example, Congress appropriated funds for two unrequested EC-130Js\u2014one in fiscal year 1997 and one in fiscal year 1998. An October 7, 1997, memorandum from the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition noted, however, that a validated operational requirements document had not yet been generated. Additionally, these officials noted that there have been concerns that the EC-130J buy may not address all of the problems in the current EC-130 fleet\u2014primarily, the lack of adequate space on the aircraft. There are 12 crew stations aboard the EC-130 aircraft and we were told that there is barely enough room for the broadcasting equipment needed for each station. The Air Force has looked at the wide body Boeing 757 as a replacement for the current EC-130 fleet, but has since decided to use the J.", "Regarding alternatives to the J, we were told that alternatives have been evaluated and rejected in the past. Specifically, in December 1996, an unsolicited proposal was submitted to modernize the C-130 fleet. Appendix V summarizes the Air Force\u2019s reasons for rejecting this proposal. In addition to rejecting prior alternatives to the J for cost and technical reasons, Air Force officials told us that the alternatives were premature since the first C-130E is not scheduled to retire until 2002. Air Force officials also told us that the Air Force is currently considering alternatives presented by an AMC tiger team. Among other things, the goals of the AMC effort included developing an integrated plan to improve reliability and maintainability of the fleet, produce greater commonality in the fleet, and provide an overall acquisition strategy for the C-130 weapon system.", "After review of specific problems in the C-130 fleet, which included the inability of the fleet to meet Global Air Traffic Management requirements and structural/corrosion problems of the aging fleet, the tiger team recommended that the Air Force (1) modify 360 of the \u201cbest structural\u201d C-130s with a block modification process that would essentially put a new front end, including a new engine and cockpit, on the older C-130 aircraftand (2) replace aircraft with the worst service life/structural/corrosion problems\u2014about 150 in this category\u2014with new C-130J-30s. Final decisions on both matters, however, are not expected until the fall of 1998."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Is the C-130J Logistics Support Funding Shortfall?", "paragraphs": ["Air Force C-130 officials stated that funding shortfalls for the C-130 fleet have historically been a problem, primarily because Congress has added C-130 aircraft to their budget without providing the needed funding for logistics support. This support includes spare parts, training, and maintenance that is normally provided with a weapon system. These officials further stated that the Air Force was able to deal with the shortfalls in the past because a large logistics support infrastructure was in place for the C-130E and C-130H models, which helped them to absorb the shortfalls. However, they noted that because the C-130J is so different from those prior models, the majority of the support in the current infrastructure cannot be used for the J aircraft.", "Additionally, these officials noted that the Air Force, with its constrained budgets and various weapon system priorities, has not budgeted for these funding shortfalls. According to these officials, without the needed support funding, it is possible that some C-130J aircraft may have to be cannibalized to support others in the fleet or the unsupported C-130Js may have to be parked on the ramp at some locations.", "The latest Air Force funding shortfall document reported a cumulative logistics support shortfall through fiscal year 2003 of $302.11 million for the 23 C-130J aircraft on contract through 1998, the 1 requested in 1999, and the 2 that are expected to be bought in 2002 and 2003.

This includes not only the typical ICS costs such as on-site contractor personnel, technical data, and repair of reparables, but also a commercial supply support system. This support system is needed because, unlike the previous C-130 models, the Air Force does not yet have a database to determine the mean time between failure rates of the C-130J spares. As a result, the correct amount of spares to maintain the fleet\u2019s mission capable rate is not known. Hence, provisioning for the C-130J will be contracted out with this contractor support supply system.", "C-130J training systems (simulators) and the associated costs of training flight and maintenance crews.

This is the support equipment peculiar to the J and includes new or modified support equipment like testers, and special tools needed to test, remove, replace, or handle the C-130J unique items on the aircraft.", "Air Force officials stated that the J\u2019s funding problems are further exacerbated because the aircraft are being assigned to several different bases rather than a single base. Specifically, the 23 Air Force C-130Js on contract are assigned as follows: 9 WC-130Js and 4 combat delivery Js will be located at Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi; 2 EC-130Js will be located at the Air National Guard unit in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; and 8 combat delivery C-130Js will be located at the Air National Guard unit in Baltimore, Maryland. These different base assignments result in redundant logistical support such as maintenance and training costs at each base.", "Additionally, there has been much discussion between the Air Force and the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) regarding the scope of Live Fire Test (LFT) for the C-130J program. An agreement was reached in March 1998, between the two and will be reflected in the C-130J Test and Evaluation Master Plan and appropriate live fire test plans. While there is currently a funding shortfall associated with the LFT program, the Air Force has agreed to fund about $5.5 million for the following tests: (1) the wing dry bay, (2) the composite propeller, (3) engine fire suppression (combat and non-combat), (4) the vulnerability analysis, and (5) the engine blade containment. DOT&E will fund the hydrodynamic ram testing and the mission abort assessment, which will be about $2.2 million.", "Air Force and contractor officials have been working to remedy the C-130J shortfall with such efforts as commercial supply support system, also called shared logistics. Shared logistics places high-cost, low-use support equipment at a centralized location, rather than at each base, while high usage and special mission spares are placed at each of the bases where the C-130J will be located. Air Force officials said that, according to data provided by Lockheed Martin, costs for spares would total about $20 million per base for a new aircraft like the C-130J if each C-130J base was provided a full complement of spare parts. Under the shared logistics concept, only $4 million would be required for each C-130J base compared with the previously stated $20 million. Savings from this concept have already been incorporated into the Air Force\u2019s budget plan. Although no location has been selected for the centralized site, several have been suggested, including options for putting the centralized location where most of the planes will be based or at a location with access to overnight delivery services to facilitate just-in-time deliveries.", "In addition to the shared logistics savings, Congress has provided about $24 million in the fiscal year 1998 budget to help fund C-130J support shortfalls."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["DOD concurred with our report.
