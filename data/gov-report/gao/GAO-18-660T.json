However,  CMS has not used a process to identify inherent fraud risks from the  universe of potential vulnerabilities facing Medicare, including threats  from various sources. According to CPI officials, most of the agency\u2019s  fraud control activities are focused on fraud risks posed by providers.  The Fraud Risk Framework discusses fully considering inherent fraud  risks from internal and external sources in light of fraud risk factors  such as incentives, opportunities, and rationalization to commit fraud.  For example, according to CMS officials, the inherent design of the  Medicare Part C program may pose fraud risks that are challenging to  detect. A fraud risk assessment would help CMS identify all sources  of fraudulent behaviors, beyond threats posed by providers, such as  those posed by health-insurance plans, contractors, or employees.", "Assessing the likelihood and impact of fraud risks and  determining fraud risk tolerance. CMS has taken steps to prioritize  fraud risks in some areas, but it had not assessed the likelihood or  impact of fraud risks or determined fraud risk tolerance across all  parts of Medicare. Assessing the likelihood and impact of inherent  fraud risks would involve consideration of the impact of fraud risks on  program finances, reputation, and compliance. Without assessing the  likelihood and impact of risks in Medicare or internally determining  which fraud risks may fall under the tolerance threshold, CMS cannot  be certain that it is aware of the most-significant fraud risks facing this  program and what risks it is willing to tolerate based on the program\u2019s  size and complexity.", "Examining the suitability of existing fraud controls and  prioritizing residual fraud risks.

This  analysis would help CMS to prioritize residual risks and to determine  mitigation approaches. For example, CMS had not established  preventive fraud control activities in Medicare Part C. Using a fraud  risk assessment for Medicare Part C and closely examining existing  fraud control activities and residual risks, CMS could be better  positioned to address fraud risks facing this growing program and  develop preventive control activities. Furthermore, without assessing  existing fraud control activities and prioritizing residual fraud risks,  CMS cannot be assured that its current control activities are  addressing the most-significant risks.

Among contractors, CMS  encourages information sharing through conferences and workshops;  however, competition for CMS business among contractors can be a  disincentive to information sharing. CMS officials acknowledged this  concern and said that they expect contractors to share information related  to fraud schemes, outcomes of investigations, and tips for addressing  fraud, but not proprietary information such as algorithms to risk-score  providers.", "Without  developing  and  documenting  an  antifraud  strategy  based  on  a  fraud  risk  assessment,  as  called  for  in  the  design  and  implement  component of the Fraud Risk Framework, CMS cannot ensure that it has  a  coordinated  approach  to  address  the  range  of  fraud  risks  and  to  appropriately target and allocate resources for the most-significant risks.  Considering fraud risks to which Medicare is most vulnerable, in light of  the malicious intent of those who aim to exploit the programs, would help  CMS to examine its current control activities and potentially design new  ones with recognition of fraudulent behavior it aims to prevent. This focus  on fraud is distinct from a broader view of program integrity and improper  payments by considering the intentions and incentives of those who aim  to  deceive  rather  than  well-intentioned  providers  who  make  mistakes.  Also, continued growth of the program, such as growth of Medicare Part  C, calls for consideration of preventive fraud control activities across the  entire network of entities involved.", "Furthermore, considering the large size and complexity of Medicare and  the extensive stakeholder network involved in managing fraud in the  program, a strategic approach to managing fraud risks within the  programs is essential to ensure that a number of existing control activities  and numerous stakeholder relationships and incentives are being aligned  to produce desired results. Once developed, an antifraud strategy that is  clearly articulated to various CMS stakeholders would help CMS to  address fraud risks in a more coordinated and deliberate fashion.  Thinking strategically about existing control activities, resources, tools,  and information systems could help CMS to leverage resources while  continuing to integrate Medicare program-integrity efforts along functional  lines. A strategic approach grounded in a comprehensive assessment of  fraud risks could also help CMS to identify future enhancements for  existing control activities, such as new preventive capabilities for its Fraud  Prevention System (FPS) or additional fraud factors in provider  enrollment and revalidation, such as provider risk-scoring, to stay in step  with evolving fraud risks.", "CMS Has Established Monitoring and Evaluation Mechanisms That  Could Inform a Risk-Based Antifraud Strategy for Medicare  The evaluate and adapt component of the Fraud Risk Framework calls for  federal managers to evaluate outcomes using a risk-based approach and  adapt activities to improve fraud risk management. Furthermore,  according to federal internal control standards, managers should  establish and operate monitoring activities to monitor the internal control  system and evaluate the results, which may be compared against an  established baseline. Ongoing monitoring and periodic evaluations  provide assurances to managers that they are effectively preventing,  detecting, and responding to potential fraud.", "CMS has established monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for its  program-integrity activities that it could incorporate into an antifraud  strategy.", "As described in the Fraud Risk Framework, agencies can gather  information on the short-term or intermediate outcomes of some antifraud  initiatives, which may be more readily measured. For example, CMS has  developed some performance measures to provide a basis for monitoring  its progress towards meeting the program-integrity goals set in the HHS  Strategic Plan and Annual Performance Plan. Specifically, CMS  measures whether it is meeting its goal of \u201cincreasing the percentage of  Medicare FFS providers and suppliers identified as high risk that receive  an administrative action.\u201d CMS does not set specific antifraud goals for  other parts of Medicare; other CMS performance measures relate to  measuring or reducing improper payments in the various parts of  Medicare.", "CMS uses return-on-investment and savings estimates to measure the  effectiveness of its Medicare program-integrity activities and FPS. For  example, CMS uses return-on-investment to measure the effectiveness of  FPS and, in response to a recommendation we made in 2012, CMS  developed outcome-based performance targets and milestones for FPS.  CMS has also conducted individual evaluations of its program-integrity  activities, such as an interim evaluation of the prior-authorization  demonstration for power mobility devices that began in 2012 and is  currently implemented in 19 states.", "Commensurate with greater maturity of control activities in Medicare FFS  compared to other parts of Medicare and Medicaid, monitoring and  evaluation activities for Medicare Parts C and D and Medicaid are more  limited. For example, CMS calculates savings for its program-integrity  activities in Medicare Parts C and D, but not a full return-on-investment.  CMS officials told us that calculating costs for specific activities is  challenging because of overlapping activities among contractors. CMS  officials said they continue to refine methods and develop new savings  estimates for additional program-integrity activities.", "According to the Fraud Risk Framework, effective managers develop a  strategy and evaluate outcomes using a risk-based approach. In  developing an effective strategy and antifraud activities, managers  consider the benefits and costs of control activities. Ongoing monitoring  and periodic evaluations provide reasonable assurance to managers that  they are effectively preventing, detecting, and responding to potential  fraud. Monitoring and evaluation activities can also support managers\u2019  decisions about allocating resources, and help them to demonstrate their  continued commitment to effectively managing fraud risks.", "As CMS takes steps to develop an antifraud strategy, it could include  plans for refining and building on existing methods such as return-on- investment or savings measures, and setting appropriate targets to  evaluate the effectiveness of all of CMS\u2019s antifraud efforts. Such a  strategy would help CMS to efficiently allocate program-integrity  resources and to ensure that the agency is effectively preventing,  detecting, and responding to potential fraud. For example, while doing so  would involve challenges, CMS\u2019s strategy could detail plans to advance  efforts to measure a potential fraud rate through baseline and periodic  measures. Fraud-rate measurement efforts could also inform risk  assessment activities, identify currently unknown fraud risks, align  resources to priority risks, and develop effective outcome metrics for  antifraud controls. Such a strategy would also help CMS ensure that it  has effective performance measures in place to assess its antifraud  efforts beyond those related to providers in Medicare FFS, and establish  appropriate targets to measure the agency\u2019s progress in addressing fraud  risks.", "In our December 2017 report we recommended that the Administrator of  CMS should, using the results of the fraud risk assessments for Medicare,  create, document, implement, and communicate an antifraud strategy that  is aligned with and responsive to regularly assessed fraud risks. This  strategy should include an approach for monitoring and evaluation. In its  March 2018 letter to GAO, HHS stated that it is currently evaluating its  options with regards to implementing this recommendation. As of July  2018, the recommendation remains open.", "Chairman Jenkins and Ranking Member Lewis, this concludes my  prepared statement.
