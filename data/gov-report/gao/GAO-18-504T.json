As part of its ongoing work on SNAP E&T programs, GAO analyzed E&T expenditures and participation data from fiscal years 2007 through 2016, the most recent data available; reviewed relevant research from USDA; and interviewed USDA and selected state and local officials. The prior work discussed in this testimony is based on four GAO products on E&T programs (GAO-03-388), improper payments (GAO-16-708T), recipient fraud (GAO-14-641), and retailer trafficking (GAO-07-53).

These programs are generally designed to help SNAP recipients increase their ability to obtain regular employment through services such as job search and training. Some recipients may be required to participate. According to USDA, about 14 percent of SNAP recipients were subject to work requirements in an average month of fiscal year 2016, while others, such as children and the elderly, were generally exempt from these requirements. States have flexibility in how they design their E&T programs. Over the last several years, states have 1) increasingly moved away from programs that mandate participation, 2) focused on serving able-bodied adults without dependents whose benefits are generally time-limited unless they comply with work requirements, and 3) partnered with state and local organizations to deliver services. USDA has taken steps to increase support and oversight of SNAP E&T since 2014, including collecting new data on participant outcomes from states. GAO has ongoing work reviewing SNAP E&T programs, including USDA oversight.", "USDA and the states partner to address issues that affect program integrity, including improper payments and fraud, and USDA has taken some steps to address challenges in these areas, but issues remain.", "Improper Payments. In 2016, GAO reviewed SNAP improper payment rates and found that states' adoption of program flexibilities and changes in federal SNAP policy in the previous decade, as well as improper payment rate calculation methods, likely affected these rates. Although USDA reported improper payment estimates for SNAP in previous years, USDA did not report an estimate for benefits paid in fiscal years 2015 or 2016 due to data quality issues in some states. USDA has since been working with the states to improve improper payment estimates for the fiscal year 2017 review.", "Recipient Fraud. In 2014, GAO made recommendations to USDA to address challenges states faced in combatting recipient fraud. For example, GAO found that USDA's guidance on the use of transaction data to uncover potential trafficking lacked specificity and recommended USDA develop additional guidance. Since then, USDA has provided technical assistance to some states, including on the use of data analytics. GAO has ongoing work reviewing states' use of data analytics to identify SNAP recipient fraud.", "Retailer Trafficking. In 2006, GAO identified several ways in which SNAP was vulnerable to retailer trafficking\u2014a practice involving the exchange of benefits for cash or non-food items. For example, USDA had not conducted analyses to identify high-risk retailers and target its resources. Since then, USDA has established risk levels for retailers based on various factors.

According to USDA, the department  also required individual states to develop corrective action plans to  address issues identified and monitored progress to ensure states took  identified actions. On June 30, 2017, USDA notified the states that the  department would not release a national SNAP improper payment rate for  benefits paid in fiscal year 2016 and remained focused on conducting the  fiscal year 2017 review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SNAP Recipient Fraud", "paragraphs": ["FNS has increased its oversight of state anti-fraud activities in recent  years by developing new guidance and providing training and technical  assistance to states on detecting fraud by SNAP recipients and reporting  on anti-fraud activities to FNS. In 2014, we reported on 11 selected  states\u2019 efforts to combat SNAP recipient fraud and made several  recommendations to FNS to address the challenges states faced.  We  found that FNS and states faced challenges in the following areas:", "Guidance on use of data tools to detect fraud: States faced  challenges using FNS-recommended data tools to detect fraud, and  FNS is in the process of developing improved guidance to address  this concern. Specifically, FNS\u2019s guidance on the use of EBT  transaction data to uncover potential patterns of benefit trafficking  lacked the specificity states needed to uncover such activity, and we  recommended FNS develop additional guidance. Since then, FNS  contracted with a private consulting firm to provide 10 states with  technical assistance in recipient fraud prevention and detection, which  included exploring the use of data analytics to analyze and interpret  eligibility  and transaction data to identify patterns or trends and create  models that incorporate predictive analytics. FNS officials also  recently told us that the agency is developing a SNAP Fraud  Framework to provide guidance to states on improving fraud  prevention and detection. FNS officials anticipated releasing the  framework in mid- 2018.", "Tools for monitoring e-commerce websites: We also found FNS- recommended tools for automatically monitoring potential SNAP  trafficking on e-commerce websites to be of limited use and less  effective than manual searches, and FNS has developed but not  finalized guidance on using such tools. We recommended that FNS  reassess the effectiveness of its current guidance and tools for states  to monitor e-commerce and social media websites. In August 2017,  FNS officials told us that they had developed revised guidance for  states on using social media in detection of SNAP trafficking.  According to FNS, the guidance will be incorporated into the SNAP  Fraud Framework.", "Staff levels: During the time of our 2014 work, most of our 11  selected states reported difficulties conducting fraud investigations  due to reduced or stagnant staff levels while numbers of SNAP  recipients had greatly increased, but FNS decided not to make  changes to address this issue. Specifically, 8 of the 11 states we  reviewed reported inadequate staffing due to attrition, turnover, or lack  of funding. Some states suggested changing the financial incentive  structure to promote fraud investigations because agencies were not  rewarded for cost-effective, anti-fraud efforts that could prevent  ineligible people from receiving benefits. Specifically, when fraud by a  SNAP recipient is discovered, a state may generally retain 35 percent  of any recovered overpayments. However, there are no recovered  funds when a state detects potential fraud by an applicant and denies  the application. To help address states\u2019 concerns about resources  needed to conduct investigations, we recommended in our 2014  report that FNS explore ways that federal financial incentives could be  used to better support cost-effective anti-fraud strategies. FNS  reported that it took some steps to explore alternative financial  incentives, through a review of responses to a Request for Information  in the Federal Register. However, FNS decided not to pursue bonus  awards for anti-fraud and program integrity activities. Given that FNS  has not made changes in this area, state SNAP fraud agencies may  continue to report resource concerns in addressing fraud.", "Reporting guidance: We also found that FNS did not have  consistent and reliable data on states\u2019 activities because of unclear  reporting guidance, and FNS has since revised its data collection form  and provided training on the changes. To improve FNS\u2019s ability to  monitor states and obtain information about more efficient and  effective ways to combat recipient fraud, we recommended in 2014  that FNS take steps, such as providing guidance and training, to  enhance the consistency of what states report on their anti-fraud  activities. In response, FNS revised the form used to collect recipient  integrity information and changed the reporting frequency from annual  to quarterly, effective fiscal year 2017. FNS officials also reported  providing training to approximately 400 state agency and FNS  regional office personnel on the updates to the form and related  instructions.", "In our ongoing work, we are further reviewing states\u2019 use of data analytics  to identify SNAP recipient fraud, including that which may be occurring  during out-of-state transactions. Because transactions that may appear  suspicious\u2014such as those made out-of-state\u2014may in fact be legitimate,  states may use data analytic techniques to include additional factors that  may help them better target their efforts to identify potential fraud.  However, states may have different levels of capacity for using data  analytics to detect fraud. We are examining how 7 selected states are  using data analytics and identifying the advantages and challenges states  have experienced in doing so. We are also assessing FNS\u2019s efforts to  assist states in implementing GAO\u2019s leading practices for data analytics  outlined in GAO\u2019s Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal  Programs outlined in GAO\u2019s Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in  Federal Programs. In addition, we are conducting our own analysis of  EBT out-of-state SNAP transaction data. We expect to report on our  findings later this year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SNAP Retailer Trafficking", "paragraphs": ["FNS has taken some steps to prevent, detect, and respond to retailers  who traffic SNAP benefits since our last report on the issue in 2006, but  trafficking continues to be a problem. For example, in February 2018, a  federal jury convicted a grocery store operator in Baltimore on charges of  wire fraud in connection with a scheme to traffic more than $1.6 million in  SNAP benefits for food sales that never occurred. The grocery store  operator paid cash for SNAP benefits, typically paying the recipient half  the value of the benefits and keeping the other half for himself. In our  2006 report, we found that SNAP was vulnerable to retailer trafficking in  several areas, including:", "Requirements for food that retailers must stock to participate in  SNAP: In 2006, we found that FNS had minimal requirements for the  amounts of food that retailers must stock, which could allow retailers  more likely to traffic into the program, although the agency has since  taken steps to increase these requirements. In our 2006 report, FNS  officials said that they authorized stores with limited food stock to  provide access to food in low-income areas where large grocery  stores were scarce. At that time, retailers were generally required to  stock a minimum of 12 food items (at least 3 varieties of 4 staple food  categories, such as fruits and vegetables), but FNS rules did not  specify how many items of each variety would constitute sufficient  stock. FNS officials told us that a retailer that only carries small  quantities of food, such as a few cans of one kind of vegetable, may  intend to traffic. In 2016, FNS promulgated a final rule increasing food  stock requirements. FNS officials told us that these new rules are  designed to encourage stores to provide more healthy food options for  recipients and discourage trafficking. According to FNS, retailers are  now generally required to stock at least 36 food items (a certain  variety and quantity of staple foods in each of the 4 staple food  categories).", "Focus on high-risk retailers: We also found in 2006 that FNS had  not conducted analyses to identify characteristics of retailers at high  risk of trafficking and to target its resources\u2014a shortcoming FNS has  since taken some steps to address. For example, we reported that  some stores may be at risk of trafficking because one or more  previous owners had been found trafficking at the same location.  However, FNS did not have a system in place to ensure that these  retailers were quickly targeted for heightened attention. In addition,  once a store was authorized to participate in the program, FNS staff  typically would not inspect the store again until it applied for  reauthorization 5 years later. We recommended that FNS identify  the stores most likely to traffic and provide earlier, more targeted  oversight to those stores. In 2009, FNS began establishing risk levels  for each authorized retailer, identifying high-risk stores as those with a  prior permanent disqualification at that location or a nearby location.  In 2013, FNS required all high-risk retailers to go through  reauthorization and to provide additional documentation regarding  store ownership. That same year, FNS also consolidated its retailer  management functions, including those for authorizing stores and  analyzing EBT transaction data, into a single national structure known  as the Retailer Operations Division. FNS officials told us that this  structure enables the agency to identify and deploy their investigative  resources to the areas of highest risk nationally, rather than within a  given region.", "Penalties to deter retailer trafficking: We also found in our 2006  report that FNS\u2019s penalties for retailer trafficking may be insufficient to  deter traffickers, and since then, FNS has proposed\u2014but not  finalized\u2014rules to increase them. FNS imposes administrative  penalties for retailer trafficking\u2014generally a permanent  disqualification from the program or a monetary penalty. FNS relies  on the USDA Office of Inspector General (OIG) and other law  enforcement entities to conduct investigations that can lead to criminal  prosecutions. In our 2006 report, we recommended that FNS  develop a strategy to increase penalties for trafficking. The Food,  Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (known as the 2008 Farm Bill)  gave USDA authority to impose higher monetary penalties, and the  authority to impose both a monetary penalty and program  disqualification on retailers found to have violated relevant law or  regulations (which includes those found to have trafficked). In 2012,  FNS proposed regulatory changes to implement these authorities.  However, FNS has not finalized these rules, and as of fall 2017, the  rules were considered \u201cinactive.\u201d", "In our ongoing work, we are continuing to assess FNS\u2019s efforts to  prevent, detect, and respond to retailer trafficking, as well as examining  what is known about the extent of retailer trafficking nationwide. As part of  this work, we are continuing to review FNS\u2019s response to our prior  recommendations, as well as related recommendations made by USDA\u2019s  OIG. We are also studying FNS\u2019s periodic estimates of the rate of  retailer trafficking, expressed as the dollar value and percentage of all  SNAP benefits that were trafficked and the percentage of retailers  involved. These data suggest an increase in the estimated rate of retailer  trafficking since our 2006 report. However, we and others, including a  group of experts convened by FNS, have identified some limitations with  the retailer trafficking estimates. For example, the trafficking rate is  calculated based on a sample of retailers that FNS considers most likely  to traffic. Although FNS adjusts the data to better represent the broader  population of authorized retailers, it is uncertain whether the resulting  estimates accurately reflect the extent of trafficking nationwide. We are  reviewing these limitations and FNS\u2019s efforts to address them in our  ongoing work.", "Chairman Jordan, Chairman Palmer, Ranking Member Krishnamoorthi,  Ranking Member Raskin, and Members of the Subcommittees, this  completes my prepared statement.
