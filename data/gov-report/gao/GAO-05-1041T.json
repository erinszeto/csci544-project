In 2002, the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC)--which is affiliated with VA's medical facility in Charleston--proposed that VA and MUSC enter into a joint venture for a new VA facility as part of MUSC's plan to expand its medical campus. Under the proposal, MUSC and VA would jointly construct and operate a new medical center in Charleston. In 2004, the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services (CARES) Commission, an independent body charged with assessing VA's capital asset requirements, issued its recommendations on the realignment and modernization of VA's capital assets. Although the Commission did not recommend a replacement facility for Charleston, it did recommend, among other things, that VA promptly evaluate MUSC's proposal. This testimony discusses GAO's preliminary findings on the (1) current condition of the Charleston facility, (2) extent to which VA and MUSC collaborated on the joint venture proposal, and (3) issues for VA to consider when exploring the opportunity to participate in the joint venture.

For decades VA has developed and  maintained partnerships, or affiliations, with university medical schools to  obtain medical services for veterans and provide training and education to  medical residents. Today, VA has affiliations with 107 medical schools.  These affiliations\u2014-one of which is with MUSC\u2014help VA fulfill its mission  of providing health care to the nation\u2019s veterans. For example, many  MUSC physicians serve as residents at VA\u2019s medical facility in Charleston,  the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center. This medical facility is an  important part of the VA health care network, providing over 4,000  inpatient stays for veterans in 2004.", "To provide health care to veterans, in part through partnerships with  university medical schools, VA manages a diverse inventory of real  property. VA reported in February 2005 that its capital assets included  more than 5,600 buildings and about 32,000 acres of land. However, many  of VA\u2019s facilities were built more than 50 years ago and are no longer well  suited to providing accessible, high-quality, cost-effective health care in  the 21st century. To address its aging infrastructure, VA, in 1999, initiated  the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services (CARES) process\u2014 the first comprehensive, long-range assessment of its health care system\u2019s  capital asset requirements in almost 20 years. In February 2004, the  CARES Commission\u2014an independent body charged with assessing VA\u2019s  capital assets\u2014issued its recommendations regarding the realignment and  modernization of VA\u2019s capital assets necessary to meet the demand for  veterans\u2019 health care services through 2022. For example, the Commission  recommended replacing VA facilities in Denver and Orlando. The  Commission did not recommend replacing the VA facility in Charleston,  which is a primary, secondary, and tertiary care facility. However, the  Commission recommended that, among other things, VA promptly  evaluate MUSC\u2019s proposal to jointly construct and operate a new medical  center with VA in Charleston, noting that such an arrangement could serve  as a possible framework for partnerships in the future. In responding to  the Commission\u2019s recommendations, the Secretary stated that VA will  continue to consider options for sharing opportunities with MUSC.", "My statement today will cover the (1) current condition of the Charleston  facility and the actions VA has taken to implement CARES  recommendations at the facility, (2) extent to which VA and MUSC  collaborated on the proposal for a joint medical center, and (3) issues for  VA to consider when exploring the opportunity to participate in the joint  venture. My preliminary comments are based on our ongoing work for the  full Committee as well as GAO\u2019s body of work on VA\u2019s management of its  capital assets. For our ongoing work, we interviewed VA and MUSC  officials as well as other stakeholders in the Charleston area, including  officials from the City of Charleston and the U.S. Navy. We also reviewed  the CARES Commission\u2019s comments on and recommendations for the  Charleston facility; documents relating to the MUSC proposal, including  correspondence between MUSC and VA; federal statutes; and past GAO  reports. We obtained comments on this testimony from VA and MUSC  officials, which we incorporated as appropriate.

Under MUSC\u2019s proposal, MUSC would acquire the  site of the current VA facility in Charleston for part of its expansion  project and then enter into a joint venture to construct and operate a new  facility on MUSC property. The CARES Commission recommended that  VA promptly evaluate MUSC\u2019s proposal to jointly construct and operate a  new medical center with VA. Although there has been some discussion  and correspondence between VA and MUSC since 2002 on the joint  venture proposal, collaboration has been minimal.

The facility consists of more than 352,000 square feet  with 117 medical and surgical beds and 28 nursing home care unit beds;  according to VA officials, the average daily occupancy rate is about 80  percent. The outpatient workload was about 460,000 clinic visits in fiscal  year 2004. VA employs about 1,100 staff at the Charleston facility, which  has an annual operating budget of approximately $160 million.", "VA\u2019s Charleston medical facility is affiliated with MUSC. MUSC is the main  source of the Charleston facility\u2019s medical residents, who rotate through  all major VA clinical service areas. VA also purchases approximately $13  million in medical care services from MUSC, including gastroenterology,  infectious disease, internal medicine, neurosurgery, anesthesia,  pulmonary, cardiovascular perfusion, and radiology services.

Phase I also includes the construction of  an atrium connecting the two buildings, a parking structure, and a central  energy plant. Initial plans for phases II through V include diagnostic and  treatment space and patient bed towers. As shown in figure 2, phases IV  and V would be built on VA property. In particular, phase V would be built  on the site of VA\u2019s existing medical center. MUSC has informed VA about  its proposed locations for these facilities. According to MUSC officials,  there are approximately 2 years remaining for the planning of phase II.", "In November 2002, the President of MUSC sent a proposal to the Secretary  of VA about partnering with MUSC in the construction and operation of a  new medical center in phase II of MUSC\u2019s construction project. Under  MUSC\u2019s proposal, VA would vacate its current facility and move to a new  facility located on MUSC property to the south of phase I. MUSC also  indicated that sharing medical services would be a component of the joint  venture\u2014that is, VA and MUSC would enter into sharing agreements to  buy, sell, or barter medical and support services. VA and MUSC currently  share some services\u2014for example, VA purchases services for  gastroenterology, infectious disease, and internal medicine. According to  MUSC officials, the joint venture proposal would increase the level of  sharing of medical services and equipment, which would create cost  savings for both VA and MUSC. VA officials told us that the proposed joint  venture between MUSC and VA is unprecedented\u2014that is, should VA  participate in the joint venture, it would be the first of its kind between VA  and a medical education affiliate.", "In response to MUSC\u2019s proposal, VA formed an internal workgroup  composed of officials primarily from VA\u2019s Southeast Network to evaluate  MUSC\u2019s proposal. The workgroup analyzed the feasibility and cost  effectiveness of the proposal and issued a report in March 2003, which  outlined three other options available to VA: replacing the Charleston  facility at its present location, replacing the Charleston facility on land  presently occupied by the Naval Hospital in Charleston, or renovating the  Charleston facility. The workgroup concluded that it would be more cost  effective to renovate the current Charleston facility than to replace it with  a new facility. This conclusion was based, in part, on the cost estimates for  constructing a new medical center. In April 2003, the Secretary of VA sent  a counterproposal to the President of MUSC, which indicated that VA  preferred to remain in its current facility. The Secretary indicated,  however, that if VA agreed to the joint venture, it would rather place the  new facility in phase III\u2014which is north of phase I\u2014to provide better  street access for veterans. (See fig. 3 for MUSC\u2019s proposal and VA\u2019s  counterproposal.) In addition, the Secretary indicated that MUSC would  need to provide a financial incentive for VA to participate in the joint  venture. Specifically, MUSC would need to make up the difference  between the estimated life-cycle costs of renovating the Charleston facility  and building a new medical center\u2014which VA estimated to be about $85  million\u2014through negotiations or other means.", "The MUSC President responded to VA\u2019s counterproposal in an April 2003  letter to the Secretary of VA. In the letter, the MUSC President stated that  MUSC was proceeding with phase I of the project and that the joint  venture concept could be pursued during later phases of construction. The  letter did not specifically address VA\u2019s proposal to locate the new facility  in phase III, nor the suggestion that MUSC would need to provide some  type of financial incentive for VA to participate in the joint venture. To  move forward with phase I, the MUSC President stated that MUSC would  like to focus on executing an enhanced use lease (EUL) for Doughty  Street. Although MUSC owns most of the property that will be used for  phases I through III, Doughty Street is owned by VA and serves as an  access road to the Charleston facility and parking lots. The planned facility  for phase I would encompass Doughty Street. (See fig. 4.) Therefore,  MUSC could not proceed with phase I\u2014as originally planned\u2014until MUSC  secured the rights to Doughty Street. To help its medical affiliate move  forward with construction, VA executed a EUL agreement with MUSC in  May 2004 for use of the street. According to the terms of the EUL, MUSC  will pay VA $342,000 for initial use of the street and $171,000 for each of  the following eight years.", "Although both entities successfully collaborated in executing the  enhanced use lease for Doughty Street, limited collaboration and  communication generally characterize the negotiations between MUSC  and VA over the joint venture proposal. In particular, before this summer,  VA and MUSC had not exchanged critical information that would help  facilitate negotiations. For instance, MUSC did not clearly articulate to VA  how replacing the Charleston facility, rather than renovating the facility,  would improve the quality of health care services for veterans or benefit  VA. MUSC officials had generally stated that sharing services and  equipment would create efficiencies and avoid duplication, which would  lead to cost savings. However, MUSC had not provided any analyses to  support such claims. Similarly, as required by law, VA studied the  feasibility of coordinating its health care services with MUSC, pending  construction of MUSC\u2019s new medical center. This study was completed in  June 2004. However, VA officials did not include MUSC officials in the  development of the study, nor did they share a copy of the completed  study with MUSC. VA also updated its cost analysis of the potential joint  venture this spring, but again, VA did not share the results with MUSC.  Because MUSC was not included in the development of these analyses,  there was no agreement between VA and MUSC on key input for the  analyses, such as the specific price MUSC would charge VA for, or the  nature of, the medical services that would be provided. As a result of the  limited collaboration and communication, negotiations stalled\u2014prior to  August 2005, the last formal correspondence between VA and MUSC  leadership on the joint venture was in April 2003.

The proposed joint venture presents a unique  opportunity for VA to reevaluate how it provides health care services to  veterans in Charleston. Our ongoing work, as well as our previous work on  VA\u2019s capital realignment efforts, cost-benefit analysis, organizational  transformation, and performance management, however, suggests many  issues to consider before making a decision about a joint venture,  including governance, legal, and stakeholder issues. Some of these issues  will be directly addressed by the workgroups, while others, such as the  concerns of stakeholders, will not. In addition, some issues can be  addressed through collaboration between VA and MUSC, while others may  require VA to seek legislative remedies. Among the issues to explore are  the following:    Comparing appropriate options and assessing the costs and  benefits of all options: According to Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) guidelines on evaluating capital assets, a comparison of options, or  alternatives, including the status quo, is critical for ensuring that the best  alternative is selected. In its guidance, OMB encourages decision makers  to consider the different ways in which various functions, most notably  health care service delivery in this case, can be performed. OMB  guidelines further state that comparisons of costs and benefits should  facilitate selection among competing alternatives. The finance workgroup  is examining the potential costs for shared services within a joint facility.  However, it is unclear whether the workgroup will weigh the benefits and  costs of a new facility against those of other alternatives, including  maintaining the existing medical center.", "VA will also need to weigh the costs and benefits of investing in a joint  venture in Charleston against the needs of other VA facilities in the  network and across the nation. VA did not include the Charleston facility  on its list of highest priority major medical facility construction  requirements for fiscal years 2004 through 2010. According to VA, the list  of priorities, which includes 48 projects across the nation, aligns with  existing CARES recommendations. Nevertheless, exploring the potential  costs and benefits of a joint venture gives VA an opportunity to reexamine  how it delivers health care services to the nation\u2019s veterans and uses its  affiliations with medical universities now and in the future. As we have  stated in previous reports, given the nation\u2019s long-term fiscal challenges  and other challenges of the 21st Century, such reexaminations of federal  programs are warranted. Moreover, as the CARES Commission noted, the  potential joint venture between VA and MUSC is a possible framework for  future partnerships.", "Developing a governance plan that outlines responsibilities and  ensures accountability: If VA and MUSC decide to enter into a joint  venture for a new facility, they will need a plan for governing the facility.  Any governance plan would have to maintain VA\u2019s direct authority over  and accountability for the care of VA patients. In addition, if shared  medical services are a component of a joint venture between MUSC and  the VA, the entities will need a mechanism to ensure that the interests of  the patients served by both are protected today and in the future. For  instance, VA may decide to purchase operating room services from   MUSC. If the sharing agreement was dissolved at some point in the  future, it would be difficult for VA to resume the independent provision of  these services. Also, if MUSC physicians were to treat VA beneficiaries, or  VA physicians were to treat MUSC patients, each entity would need a clear  understanding of how to report health information to its responsible  organization. Therefore, a clear plan for governance would ensure that VA  and MUSC could continue to serve their patients\u2019 health care needs as well  as or better than before.", "Identifying legal issues and seeking legislative remedies: The  proposed joint venture raises a number of complex legal issues depending  on the type of joint venture that is envisioned.  Many of the legal issues  that will need to be addressed involve real estate, construction,  contracting, budgeting, and employment. The following are among some  of the potential issues relating to a joint venture that VA previously  identified:   What type of interest will VA have in the facility? If MUSC is  constructing the facility on MUSC property, will VA be entering into a  leasehold interest in real property or a sharing agreement for space,  and what are the consequences of each? If the facility is to be located  on VA property, will it involve a land transfer to MUSC or will VA lease  the property to MUSC under its authority to enter into a EUL  agreement? What are the advantages and disadvantages of these  options?", "Because MUSC contracting officials do not have the authority to legally  bind the VA, how would contracting for the services and equipment be  handled?", "The legal workgroup is currently identifying VA\u2019s and MUSC\u2019s legal  authorities, or lack thereof, on numerous issues relating to entering into a  joint venture. Should VA decide to participate in the joint venture, it may  need to seek additional authority from the Congress.", "Involving stakeholders in the decisionmaking process: Participating  in a joint venture medical center, particularly if it includes significant  service sharing between VA and MUSC, has significant implications for the  medical center\u2019s stakeholders, including VA patients, VA employees, and  the community. These stakeholders have various perspectives and  expectations\u2014some of which are common to the different groups, while  others are unique. For example, union representatives and VA officials  whom we spoke to indicated that VA patients and employees would likely  be concerned about maintaining the quality of patient care at a new facility  and access to the current facility during construction. Union  representatives also said the employees would be concerned about the  potential for the loss of jobs if VA participated in the joint venture and  purchased additional services from MUSC. As VA and MUSC move  forward in negotiations, it will be important for all stakeholders\u2019 concerns  to be addressed.", "Developing a system to measure performance and results: If VA and  MUSC decide to jointly build and operate a new facility in Charleston, it  will become, as noted in the CARES Commission report, a possible  framework for future partnerships between VA and other medical  universities. As a result, a system for measuring whether the new joint  venture facility is achieving the intended results would be useful. In our  previous work on managing for results, we have emphasized the  importance of establishing meaningful, outcome-oriented performance  goals. In this case, potential goals could be operational cost savings and  improved health care for veterans. If the goals are not stated in  measurable terms, performance measures should be established that  translate those goals into concrete, observable conditions. Such  measures would enable VA and other stakeholders to determine whether  progress is being made toward achieving the goals.

To address  future health care needs of veterans, VA\u2019s challenge is to explore  alternative ways to fulfill its mission of providing veterans with quality  health care. The prospect of establishing a joint venture medical center  with MUSC presents a good opportunity for VA to study the feasibility of  one method\u2014expanding its relationships with university medical school  affiliates to include the sharing of medical services in an integrated facility.  This is just one of several ways VA could provide care to veterans.  Evaluating this option would involve VA officials, working in close  collaboration with MUSC officials, weighing the benefits and costs as well  as the risks involved in a joint venture against those of other alternatives,  including maintaining the current medical center. Determining whether a  new facility for Charleston is justified in comparison with the needs of  other facilities in the VA system is also important. Until these difficult, but  critical, issues are addressed, a fully-informed final decision on the joint  venture proposal cannot be made.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
