We recommended that the Navy analyze how it allocates its  maintenance workload across public and private shipyards. DOD  concurred with our recommendation, stating that it has taken the first  steps to take a more holistic view of submarine maintenance  requirements and impacts across both the public and private shipyards.

We reported in  September 2017 that facility and equipment limitations at the  shipyards contributed to maintenance delays for the aircraft carriers  and submarines, hindering the shipyards\u2019 ability to support the Navy.  Specifically, we found that the shipyards would be unable to support  an estimated one-third of maintenance periods planned over the next  23 years. We recommended that the Navy take steps to improve its  management of shipyard investments; the Navy concurred with this  recommendation and we are encouraged by its response. For  example, the Navy has developed a plan for the optimal placement of  facilities and major equipment at each public shipyard, which the Navy  estimates can ultimately increase its maintenance efficiency by  reducing personnel and materiel travel by an average of 65 percent.  This equates to recovering about 328,000 man days per year\u2014an  amount roughly equal to that of an aircraft carrier maintenance period.  However, the Navy\u2019s preliminary estimate \u2014that this effort will require  an estimated $21 billion and 20 years to address\u2014is well beyond  historical funding levels, and does not include some potentially  significant costs (e.g., for utilities, roads, or environmental  remediation).", "Shipyard workforce gaps and inexperience are limiting factors.", "The Navy has reported a variety of workforce challenges at the Navy\u2019s  four public shipyards such as hiring personnel in a timely manner and  providing personnel with the training necessary to gain proficiency in  critical skills.

For  example, 45 percent of the Puget Sound and 30 percent of the  Portsmouth Naval Shipyards\u2019 skilled workforce have fewer than 5  years of experience. According to DOD officials, workforce shortages  and inexperience contribute to maintenance delays. For example, at  Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, two submarines were delayed  approximately 20 months, in part because of shortages in ship fitters  and welders, among other skilled personnel. Most of DOD\u2019s depots,  which include the naval shipyards, have taken actions to maintain  critical skills through retention incentives, bonuses, and awards.

In October  2017, we reported that:", "F-35B aircraft (including Marine Corps aircraft) were available (i.e.,  the aircraft were safe to fly, available for use, and able to perform at  least one tasked mission) about 52 percent of the time from March  2017 through June 2017, which fell short of the 65-percent goal  established by the Marine Corps for non-deployed units and", "F-35B aircraft (including Marine Corps aircraft) were fully mission  capable (i.e., the aircraft were capable of accomplishing all tasked  missions) about 15 percent of the time from March 2017 through June  2017, which fell short of the 60-percent goal established by the Marine  Corps for non-deployed units.", "We also reported on numerous sustainment challenges leading to less  than desirable outcomes for F-35 warfighter readiness. For example, F-35  aircraft were unable to fly 22 percent of the time because of parts  shortages from January 2017 through August 7, 2017. Additionally,  DOD\u2019s capabilities to repair F-35 parts at military depots were 6 years  behind schedule, which resulted in average part repair times that are  twice that of the program\u2019s objective.", "As DOD gains experience with the F-35, our work has shown that the  department has encountered additional challenges. In 2017, the Marine  Corps became the first military service to station F-35 aircraft overseas,  transferring aircraft to Iwakuni, Japan. While in the Pacific, DOD expects  to disperse its F-35s into smaller detachments to outmaneuver the enemy  and counter regional threats. However, in April 2018, we reported that this  approach posed logistics and supply challenges. In June 2018, we  reported that the F-35 program had not improved its reliability and  maintainability over the past year and continued to fall short on half of its  performance targets. Furthermore, we found that the program may not  meet its required targets before each variant of the F-35 is expected to  demonstrate maturity\u2014the point at which the aircraft has flown enough  hours to predictably determine reliability and maintainability over its  lifespan. This means that the Navy and the Marine Corps may have to  decide whether they are willing to accept less reliable and maintainable  aircraft than originally planned. Among other outcomes, this could result  in higher maintenance costs and lower aircraft availability than anticipated  which also could pose readiness challenges in the future. As we reported  in October 2017, the poor reliability of certain parts is already contributing  to shortages of F-35 spare parts.", "Challenges posed by the F-35 program are largely the result of  sustainment plans that do not fully include or consider key requirements.  Our work has shown that planning for sustainment and aligning its  funding are critical if DOD wants to meet its aircraft availability goals and  effectively deploy to support operations. To address the challenges  associated with F-35 sustainment and operational deployment, we  recommended that DOD revise its sustainment plans, align associated  funding, and mitigate the risks associated with key supply chain-related  challenges for deployed F-35s in the Pacific, among others. DOD  concurred with these recommendations and stated that it is taking steps  to address them. Furthermore, as previously discussed, the Secretary of  Defense has established an 80-percent mission capability goal for critical  aviation assets, including the F-35. Due to current low availability and  numerous sustainment issues, the F-35 fleet will be challenged in  meeting the goal.", "In sum, the Navy\u2019s and Marine Corps\u2019 significant readiness challenges  have developed over more than a decade of conflict, budget uncertainty,  and reductions in force structure. Both services have made encouraging  progress identifying the causes of their readiness decline and have begun  efforts to arrest and reverse it; however, our prior work shows that fully  addressing the persistent readiness challenges will require years of  sustained management attention. Our work cited today contains 25  specific recommendations to the Navy and the Marine Corps and an  additional 20 recommendations to various other DOD components to  assist these services in rebuilding the readiness of their forces and in  modernizing for the future. Attention to these recommendations can assist  the Navy and the Marine Corps as they seek to rebuild the readiness of  their forces.", "Chairmen Wicker and Sullivan, Ranking Members Hirono and Kaine, and  Members of the Subcommittees, this concludes my prepared statement.
