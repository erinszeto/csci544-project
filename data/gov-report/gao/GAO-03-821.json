However, Education is not authorized to directly receive taxpayer information from IRS to verify eligibility for student financial aid provided under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA). In academic year 2001-02, 11.4 million students applied for $54 billion in aid. A 1998 amendment to HEA was intended to authorize the matching of student aid applicant information with several elements of federal income tax return information. However, HEA could not be used as intended because Internal Revenue Code Section 6103 was not specifically amended so that Education and its contractors, which assist Education in administering the various financial aid programs, could have access to taxpayer information. Based on a study that matched Education data and IRS income information, Education estimates that it made approximately $602 million in grant overpayments during fiscal years 2001 and 2002. IRS does not use personal information collected from applicants and maintained by Education to ensure that taxpayers meet their tax obligations because IRS officials believe the taxpayer information IRS receives is more accurate. In general, IRS officials' views are supported by IRS's past estimates of taxpayers' levels of compliance and by the results of Education's studies and investigations. For example, in the mid-1990s, IRS estimated that taxpayers with only wage income had a 99 percent voluntary compliance rate and taxpayers with interest and dividend income were 95 percent compliant in reporting this income. However, Education's student aid application data are not suited to IRS's tax administration purposes because the applications ask students and/or their parents to report data that come directly from their tax returns."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each year, federal agencies make billions of dollars of improper payments  under various federal programs.

IRC  Section 6103 specifies which agencies (or other entities) may have access  to certain types of tax return information, for what purposes such access  may be granted, and under what conditions the information will be  received. For example, before receiving taxpayer information, agencies  are required to advise IRS how they intend to use the information and to  establish detailed plans that ensure the confidentiality and safeguarding of  the information.", "Similar to IRC Section 6103, the Privacy Act of 1974 regulates the federal  government\u2019s use of personal information by limiting the collection,  disclosure, and use of personal information maintained in an agency\u2019s  system of records. Personal information is further protected by the  Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 (Privacy Act). It  requires that agencies enter into written agreements, referred to as  matching agreements, when they share information that is protected by  the Privacy Act for the purpose of conducting computer matches.", "IRS receives tax returns from about 88 million individual taxpayers who  have wage and investment income, and approximately 45 million small  business and self-employed taxpayers. IRS performs a variety of checks to  ensure the accuracy of information these taxpayers report on their tax  returns. These checks include verifying computations on returns,  requesting more information about items on tax returns, and matching  information reported by third parties to income reported by taxpayers on  returns (e.g., document matching). IRS\u2019s document matching program has  proven to be a highly cost-effective way of identifying underreported  income, thereby bringing in billions of dollars of tax revenue while at the  same time boosting voluntary compliance.", "Approximately 11 million individuals applied for over $50 billion in federal  student financial aid in academic year 2001-02. Title IV of HEA authorized  several student aid programs, including the following:    Pell Grants\u2014grants to undergraduate students who are enrolled in degree  or certificate programs and have federally defined financial need;     Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (SEOG)\u2014grants for  undergraduate students with federally defined financial need;    Stafford and Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) loans\u2014 loans that are made by private lenders and guaranteed by the federal  government (guaranteed loans) or made directly by the federal  government through a student\u2019s school (Direct Loans);    Perkins loans\u2014low-interest loans to undergraduate and graduate students  for which interest does not accrue while the students are enrolled at least  half-time in eligible programs; and    Work-study\u2014on- or off-campus jobs for which students who have  federally defined need earn at least the current federal minimum wage and  for which institutions or off-campus employers pay a portion of their  wages.", "As shown in figure 1, for academic year 2001-02, 78 percent of federal  student aid came from loans, 20 percent came from grants, and 2 percent  came from federal work-study programs.", "Education has created many information systems to support the various  student financial aid programs it administers. In many cases, these  systems are maintained and operated by contractors, which are  responsible for processing the student financial aid application data and  providing such data to the schools, as well as to Education to use in  managing and overseeing the programs. As such, a student\u2019s financial aid  process begins when he or she submits the Free Application for Federal  Student Aid (FAFSA). The student (and parents of a dependent student)  submits the FAFSA to the contractor that enters the data from the  application. On behalf of Education, the contractor calculates the  expected family contribution figure and performs database matches and  edits to ensure that all needed information is included and that the student  meets eligibility requirements, including not having defaulted on a prior  student loan. The contractor then sends the results of the matches and  other processing results to the student and the school(s). The school(s)  request any supporting documents needed to verify application data and  determine the student\u2019s eligibility for aid, and construct an award package  of available types of aid.

The ICR plan allows Federal Direct Loan Program  borrowers to repay loans as a percentage of their income. To participate in  this program, the borrower must authorize IRS (i.e., give his or her  consent) to share income information with Education. Approximately  100,000 consents are processed under the ICR plan for repayment each  year.", "Under the Taxpayer Address Request (TAR) program, as authorized by  IRC Section 6103(m)(4), IRS provides the mailing addresses of taxpayers  to Education to be used in collecting debt from student loan defaulters.  Specifically, Education furnishes the name and Social Security number  (SSN) to the IRS for each defaulted student. IRS then conducts a match of  the information and provides Education the most recent address for the  taxpayer. Education sends about 4.6 million records annually to IRS for  matching under the TAR program.", "Additionally, as part of its research activities, Education receives  aggregate taxpayer income information from IRS in the form of tables that  it uses in establishing performance measures and selection criteria for its  student aid application verification process. Education also uses these  data in researching and computing statistical data on overall borrower  debt, such as determining the average and median debt burden ratios for  any given year.", "As part of the federal student aid application process, every year since the  mid-1980s, Education selects approximately 30 percent of its student aid  applicants for verification purposes. When a student is selected for  verification, he or she is required to provide copies of his or her (or  parents\u2019) tax returns to the school. If the student refuses to do so, he or  she will not receive federal aid. The school then compares the information  on the tax return to information on the FAFSA and corrects any  inconsistencies on the FAFSA to match the information on the tax return.  This current verification process has at least two drawbacks. The process  is time consuming and paper intensive because it involves approximately  3.6 million paper copies of tax returns that schools match. In addition, the  process relies on applicants providing copies of their tax returns, which  may not be the same as those submitted to IRS.", "Beginning in October 2002, Education began an electronic verification  pilot project involving 148 of these selected students who were asked to  authorize IRS to release their tax information to their academic  institutions via the Internet. The purpose of this pilot was to take the  student and/or his or her parents out of the middle of the verification  process between the IRS and the school so that the school relies on  income information it obtains directly from IRS, thereby making the  process more efficient.", "Under this pilot project, once the student, parent, or spouse authorized the  release of his or her tax information, IRS sent the tax transcripts for that  individual to the school, which then resolved any inconsistencies between  information on the tax transcript and on the FAFSA. This pilot match  ended on March 31, 2003, and, according to an Education official, the  initial feedback from the participating schools and taxpayers was very  positive. Education officials are currently compiling data from the pilot  schools and taxpayers and will be issuing a report in the fall of 2003 on the  ease of use, statistical data, and any needed changes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legal Impediment Hinders Data Sharing for Education\u2019s Student Financial Aid Programs", "paragraphs": ["Although Education receives some taxpayer information in conjunction  with some of its programs, IRC Section 6103 does not authorize Education  to obtain taxpayer information directly from IRS to verify eligibility or  determine payment amounts for its federal student aid programs.

As shown in figure  2, over a 10-year academic period, the amount of student aid awarded  grew 92 percent, from approximately $28 billion in academic year 1991-92  to approximately $54 billion in academic year 2001-02.", "Also, because IRC Section 6103 does not authorize Education to directly  obtain taxpayer information from IRS to establish the repayment amount  for ICR student loans, taxpayer consent is required for IRS to share  income information with Education.", "IRC Section 6103 was enacted, in part, to control whether and how tax  information submitted to IRS on federal tax returns could be shared. It  was amended in 1976 in an attempt to balance confidentiality and the need  to disclose returns and return information for legitimate purposes.  Determining the most appropriate way to balance these two  considerations has been an issue that has faced Congress for a number of  years. Congress believed that not only did taxpayers have a right to expect  the personal information they report to IRS to remain private, but that  such privacy protection was also an important component of continued  voluntary compliance. Moreover, many observers and privacy advocates  believe that disclosure of return information may decrease taxpayers\u2019  willingness to comply with the tax law and that tax administration suffers  when return information is disclosed for nontax purposes.", "IRC Section 6103 restrictions were the focus of past legislative action  taken to address limitations on data sharing and matching activities  between IRS and Education in connection with student financial aid  programs. According to Education officials, a 1998 amendment to HEA  was intended to authorize the matching of student aid applicant  information with several elements of federal income tax return  information.

Further, in August 2002, officials from Treasury, the  Office of Management and Budget, and Education proposed a legislative  amendment to IRC Section 6103 that would allow IRS to match the income  reported on federal student aid applications with income tax return  information and share the results with Education.", "The language in the proposed amendment stresses balancing the need for  accurate student aid applicant information with the importance of  maintaining the integrity of IRS taxpayer information. The proposed  legislative amendment specifies, \u201cthe tax data would be disclosed only for  very limited purposes, only to the Department of Education and its  contractors, and then only after a series of rigorous safeguards were  implemented.\u201d  The proposed amendment was included in the President\u2019s  Fiscal Year 2004 Budget, which stated that IRS matching of student aid  application income data with applicant tax data \u201cis projected to save     $638 million in Pell Grant costs over 2003\u20132004, significantly reducing  existing funding shortfalls.\u201d  However, it does not appear in the Taxpayer  Protection and IRS Accountability Act of 2003\u2014the most recent tax bill  that contains several other confidentiality and disclosure provisions.  Moreover, as of June 2003, Congress had not acted on the proposed  amendment.", "Apart from the proposed legislative amendment, Education officials noted  that several operational details remain to be addressed by IRS and  Education, many of which depend ultimately on the final language in the  legislation. For example, because the schools act as agents for Education  in the review, collection, and disbursement of financial aid awards, the  details surrounding how best to make the matching program work for both  the schools and the applicants must be addressed. In addition, Education  officials said careful consideration must be given to the timing for  matching student aid applications with tax returns. According to the  officials, most students can submit their FAFSAs starting January 1. The  applications provide details on their income, or that of their parents\u2019, for  the previous year. However, taxpayers have until April 15 to file their tax  returns and can request extensions. Therefore, IRS information may not be  available for matching purposes until well after initial student aid  eligibility determinations have been made. In a September 2000 report, we  noted that while such a match may not be timely enough for initial  eligibility verification purposes, it may be possible to conduct a match  with IRS using fairly complete taxpayer data because financial aid  payments are typically not made until late August or September.", "Education officials contend that while the timing of the match would be  less than ideal for helping to make initial student financial aid decisions,  they have established interim steps to address the timing issue, such as  multiple disbursement periods and withholding of payments until income  verification is completed. Even with these interim steps in place, they  acknowledge that the timing of the matching program still remains a  challenge. Education officials said they are also in the process of  identifying other ways to address all operational details, and are  committed to working with IRS to make the matching program a success."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increased Data Sharing Can Improve Student Financial Aid Decisions", "paragraphs": ["Increased data sharing and verification between IRS and Education could  result in better decision making when awarding student financial aid and  reduced fraud.

Additionally, Education is currently  conducting a project that supports the need for increased data sharing.", "In a September 2000 report, we recommended that Congress consider  amending IRC Section 6103 to improve the ability of certain federally  funded benefit and loan programs to obtain and share information to make  timely and accurate eligibility determinations, while protecting personal  privacy and the confidentiality of personal information. Specifically, we  said \u201cthe Congress should consider amending Section 6103(l) of the  Internal Revenue Code to authorize IRS to disclose certain taxpayer data  to officers, employees, and contractors or other agents (such as schools)  of Education for purposes of verifying information reported on  applications for financial aid.\u201d  Additionally, our recent January 2003  Performance and Accountability Series report indicates that Education  could benefit from receiving IRS taxpayer information to verify income  information reported on student aid applications.", "According to Education\u2019s OIG, some students report inaccurate  information either through error or fraud on their federal student aid  applications through, for example, underreporting of income. In a  statement before Congress in 2000, the Education\u2019s Inspector General  stated that underreporting of income by student aid applicants costs  federal taxpayers over $100 million annually in overawards of Pell Grants  and awards to ineligible persons. In addition to underreporting,  Education\u2019s OIG found numerous examples of fraud, as shown in table 1.  Applicants\u2019 ability to receive student aid fraudulently could be reduced if  Education could verify applicant information using IRS taxpayer data.", "In addition to these examples of fraud, Education\u2019s research indicates it  may have overpaid an estimated $602 million in Pell Grants over a 2-year  period. As part of its efforts to show the effect of IRC Section 6103  restrictions on eligibility and payment decisions, Education is conducting  the Pell Grant Payment Study by matching information provided on  student aid applications with IRS taxpayer information. The study began in  1999 and measures the extent of underreporting and overreporting of  income based on student aid applicants\u2019 characteristics, such as income,  tax filing status, and recipients\u2019 schools.", "To enable this match, Education provides IRS with a file of student aid  applicants\u2019 SSNs. IRS officials match these SSNs with taxpayer income  information and provide the aggregated results to Education. This format  protects the taxpayers\u2019 confidentiality, in accordance with IRC Section  6103, which prohibits IRS from revealing the identity of these taxpayers to  Education. Since Education does not know the identity of the taxpayers, it  can estimate the amount of overpayments but cannot associate a specific  overpayment with a particular individual and cannot ascertain when a  mismatch may be legitimate. Thus far, the study has estimated the  percentage of Pell Grant overpayments to be 3.4 percent, or $272 million  dollars, in fiscal year 2001 and 3.3 percent, or $330 million dollars, in fiscal  year 2002, for a total of $602 million. Education has not done a similar  study for its loan programs, which account for approximately 80 percent  of federal student aid funds.", "Education officials believe amending IRC Section 6103 to enable  Education to match student aid applicant information with several  elements of federal income tax return information \u201cwould substantially  reduce the risk of fraud and overpayments\u201d associated with Education\u2019s  student financial aid program, would eliminate the need for taxpayer  consent in conjunction with the ICR program, and would make the  program more administratively efficient. This, in turn, would enhance the  integrity of the federal student aid programs and ensure that students are  receiving the amounts of assistance for which they are eligible."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "IRS Does Not Use Education\u2019s Student Aid Data and the Potential Benefit of Doing So Appears to Be Limited", "paragraphs": ["IRS does not use personal information from applicants that Education  collects and maintains to ensure that taxpayers meet their tax obligations  because IRS officials believe the taxpayer information IRS receives is  more accurate.

IRS officials said they believe the taxpayer information IRS collects and  maintains on over 100 million individual taxpayers, who file income tax  returns annually, is more accurate than that collected and maintained by  Education from applicants applying for federal student aid. The officials  noted that because federal student aid is based on income, applicants  seeking financial aid might be inclined to underreport their income to  Education in hopes of securing larger aid awards. The officials said they  believe most taxpayers know that failure to fully disclose income to IRS  could result in an audit or the use of IRS enforcement authorities to collect  delinquent taxes. Further, the officials also said they believe the  requirement to file a tax return annually helps to ensure that some of the  information IRS maintains, such as taxpayers\u2019 addresses, is more current  when compared to similar information maintained by Education.", "IRS routinely relies on information from third-party sources (e.g., banks)  to ensure that taxpayers meet their tax obligations, including both whether  taxpayers correctly report information necessary to determine the taxes  due, if any, and whether any taxpayers who should have filed returns did  not.

As noted  earlier, Education\u2019s Pell Grant Payment Study results have found that  some student aid applicants have underreported income on their  applications compared to the income that they reported to IRS. Although  Education estimates some underpayments to students during these  studies, officials say that these, in their judgment, appear to result from  mistakes in filling out applications. The work of the Education OIG also  suggests that a significant number of student aid applicants falsify copies  of tax returns or other information that they submit to Education to show  lower incomes and thereby claim higher amounts of student aid.", "Given that Education data may have limited utility for tax administration,  IRS has not investigated use of the data for tax administration. If Congress  does authorize Education to obtain taxpayer information to verify  students\u2019 eligibility for financial aid, the resulting database of mismatches  between data reported to each institution may represent a ready and low- cost opportunity for IRS to investigate whether there is any reasonable  potential for using Education information for tax administration purposes.
