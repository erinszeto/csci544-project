Proper accounting and reporting practices are essential in the public sector. The U.S. government is the largest, most diverse, most complex, and arguably the most important entity on earth today. Its services--homeland security, national defense, Social Security, mail delivery, and food inspection, to name a few--directly affect the well-being of almost every American. But sound decisions on the future direction of vital federal government programs and policies are made more difficult without timely, accurate, and useful financial and performance information. Until the problems discussed in GAO's audit report on the U.S. government's consolidated financial statements are adequately addressed, they will continue to (1) hamper the federal government's ability to accurately report a significant portion of its assets, liabilities, and costs; (2) affect the federal government's ability to accurately measure the full cost as well as the financial and nonfinancial performance of certain programs while effectively managing related operations; and (3) significantly impair the federal government's ability to adequately safeguard certain significant assets and properly record various transactions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As in the 6 previous fiscal years, certain material weaknesses in internal control and in selected accounting and reporting practices resulted in conditions that continued to prevent GAO from being able to provide the Congress and American citizens an opinion as to whether the consolidated financial statements of the U.S. government are fairly stated in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Three major impediments to an opinion on the consolidated financial statements continue to be (1) serious financial management problems at DOD, (2) the federal government's inability to fully account for and reconcile transactions between federal government entities, and (3) the federal government's ineffective process for preparing the consolidated financial statements. For fiscal year 2003, 20 of 23 Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies received unqualified opinions, the same number received by these agencies in fiscal year 2002, up from 6 for fiscal year 1996. However, only 3 of the CFO Act agencies had neither a material weakness in internal control, an issue involving compliance with applicable laws and regulations, nor an instance of lack of substantial compliance with Federal Financial Management Improvement Act requirements. The requirement for timely, accurate, and useful financial and performance management information is greater than ever as our nation faces major longterm fiscal challenges that will require tough choices in setting priorities and linking resources to results. Given the nation's large and growing long-term fiscal imbalance, which is driven largely by known demographic trends and health care costs, coupled with new homeland security and defense commitments, the status quo is unsustainable. Current financial reporting does not clearly and transparently show the wide range of responsibilities, programs, and activities that may either obligate the federal government to future spending or create an expectation for such spending and provides an unrealistic and even misleading picture of the federal government's overall performance and financial condition. In addition, too many significant federal government commitments and obligations, such as Social Security and Medicare, are not adequately addressed in the federal government's financial statements and budget process, and current federal financial reporting standards do not require such disclosure. A top-to-bottom review of government activities to ensure their relevance and fit for the 21st century and their relative priority is long overdue. The federal government needs a three-pronged approach to (1) restructure existing entitlement programs, (2) reexamine the base of discretionary and other spending, and (3) review and revise the federal government's tax policy and enforcement programs. New accounting and reporting approaches, budget control mechanisms, and metrics are needed for considering and measuring the impact of spending and tax policies and decisions over the long term."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our report on the U.S.  government\u2019s consolidated financial statements for fiscal years 2003 and  2002.

Until the  problems discussed in our report are adequately addressed, they will  continue to (1) hamper the federal government\u2019s ability to accurately report  a significant portion of its assets, liabilities, and costs; (2) affect the federal  government\u2019s ability to accurately measure the full cost as well as the  financial and nonfinancial performance of certain programs while  effectively managing related operations; and (3) significantly impair the  federal government\u2019s ability to adequately safeguard certain significant  assets and properly record various transactions.", "While the federal government has not yet been able to prepare auditable  financial statements, the requirement to do so at the consolidated level as  well as at the agency level has already yielded important results. We see  continuous movement toward the ultimate goals of annual accountability  and, more importantly, of development of the day-to-day financial  information that the federal government will need to best address today\u2019s  budgetary challenges and the looming longer-term fiscal imbalance driven  by demographic trends, rising health care costs, and new homeland  security and defense commitments. Across government, financial  management improvement initiatives are under way that, if effectively  implemented, have the potential to appreciably improve the quality of the  federal government\u2019s financial management and reporting. Federal  agencies continue to make progress in their efforts to modernize their  financial management systems and improve financial management  performance as called for in the President\u2019s Management Agenda.", "The Principals of the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program  (JFMIP) agreed with the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB)  initiative to accelerate the agency financial statements reporting date to  November 15 for fiscal year 2004. For fiscal year 2003, OMB required the  Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies to deliver their Performance  and Accountability Reports, including their audited financial statements, to  OMB by January 30, 2004. However, to prepare for meeting the required  November 15 accelerated reporting date for fiscal year 2004, OMB  encouraged the CFO Act agencies to accelerate the issuance of their fiscal  year 2003 audited financial statements to November 15, 2003, or as close to  that date as possible. OMB reported that 8 CFO Act agencies\u2014the  Department of Education, the Environmental Protection Agency, the  Department of Health and Human Services, the National Science  Foundation, the Social Security Administration, the Department of the  Treasury, the Agency for International Development, and the Department  of Veterans Affairs\u2014were able to issue their fiscal year 2003 financial  statements with unqualified audit opinions by mid-November 2003.  Another 10 CFO Act agencies issued their financial statements by  December 31, 2003, and the remaining 5 CFO Act agencies issued by the  end of January 2004. A 24th major agency, the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS), issued its financial statements on February 13, 2004. DHS  faced a herculean challenge with respect to issuing audited financial  statements, since the department had been in operation only for the last 7  months of the fiscal year and involved a transfer of operations from a  number of diverse entities, some with known financial management  problems.", "While these results represent a significant improvement over previous  years in the timeliness of CFO Act agencies\u2019 issuance of audited financial  statements, they also demonstrate the significant challenges that the  federal government will face in meeting the November 15 accelerated  reporting date for fiscal year 2004. Auditors at several of the CFO Act  agencies reported that the agencies may not be able to produce auditable  financial statements within the accelerated time frame for fiscal year 2004  without making fundamental changes to improve a number of their  financial management practices. For example, certain federal agency  auditors reported that major improvements are needed in (1) management  controls to monitor established policies and procedures for conducting  financial analyses and reconciliations throughout the year, (2) fully  integrating financial management systems, and (3) providing adequate and  skilled staff to support efficient, effective preparation of federal agency  consolidated financial statements. Our experience as the auditor of the  financial statements of the Internal Revenue Service, which successfully  accelerated its reporting to November 15 beginning with its fiscal year 2002  financial statements, showed that significant changes had to be made to  improve routine financial management procedures in order to be able to  accelerate reporting.", "For fiscal year 2003, as in fiscal year 2002, 20 of 23 CFO Act agencies were  able to attain unqualified audit opinions on their financial statements (see  table 1 and app. I), up from 6 agencies for fiscal year 1996. This is the same  number of unqualified opinions received by these CFO Act agencies for  fiscal year 2002. However, 2 agencies\u2019 fiscal year 2003 opinions were  different from those they received for fiscal year 2002. The Agency for  International Development received an unqualified opinion on all of its  fiscal year 2003 financial statements for the first time, while the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which for fiscal year 2002  received an unqualified opinion on its financial statements, received a  disclaimer of opinion for fiscal year 2003. DHS, which as I mentioned  before prepared consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2003  covering its first 7 months of operations, received a qualified opinion on  two of the six required financial statements.", "In identifying improved financial performance as one of its five  governmentwide initiatives, the President\u2019s Management Agenda  recognized that a clean (unqualified) financial audit opinion is a basic  prescription for any well-managed organization. At the same time, it  recognized that \u201cmost federal agencies that obtain clean audits only do so  after making extraordinary, labor-intensive assaults on financial records\u201d at  or after year-end. The President\u2019s Management Agenda further recognized  that without sound internal control and accurate and timely financial  information, it is not possible to accomplish the agenda and secure the best  performance and highest measure of accountability for the American  people. The JFMIP Principals have defined certain measures, in addition to  receiving an unqualified financial statement opinion, for achieving financial  management success. These additional measures include being able to  routinely provide timely, accurate, and useful financial and performance  information and having no material internal control weaknesses or material  noncompliance with laws and regulations and the requirements of the  Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA). As  shown in table 1, while the severity and magnitude of the problems  identified vary greatly, reports of inspectors general and their contract  auditors indicated that for fiscal year 2003 only 3 of the 23 CFO Act  agencies had neither a material weakness in internal control, an issue  involving compliance with applicable laws and regulations, nor an instance  of lack of substantial compliance with the requirements of FFMIA.", "In this testimony, I will highlight the major issues relating to the  consolidated financial statements for fiscal years 2003 and 2002, discuss  systems problems that continue to hinder federal agency accountability,  and describe progress that has been made toward addressing major  impediments to an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

There  may also be additional issues that could affect the consolidated financial  statements that have not been identified.", "Major challenges include the federal government\u2019s inability to  properly account for and report property, plant, and equipment and  inventories and related property, primarily at the Department of Defense  (DOD);  reasonably estimate or adequately support amounts reported for certain  liabilities, such as environmental and disposal liabilities and related  costs at DOD, and ensure complete and proper reporting for  commitments and contingencies;  support major portions of the total net cost of government operations,  most notably related to DOD, and ensure that all disbursements are  properly recorded;  fully account for and reconcile intragovernmental activity and balances;  demonstrate how net outlay amounts reported in the consolidated  financial statements were related to net outlay amounts reported in the  underlying federal agencies\u2019 financial statements; and  effectively prepare the federal government\u2019s financial statements,  including ensuring that the consolidated financial statements are  consistent with the underlying audited agency financial statements,  balanced, and in conformity with GAAP.", "In addition to these material deficiencies, we identified four other material  weaknesses in internal control related to loans receivable and loan  guarantee liabilities, improper payments, information security, and tax  collection activities.", "The material weaknesses identified by our work are discussed in more  detail in appendix II, and their primary effects are described in appendix  III."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recurring Systems Problems Hinder Accountability", "paragraphs": ["The ability to produce the data needed to efficiently and effectively manage  the day-to-day operations of the federal government and provide  accountability to taxpayers and the Congress has been a long-standing  challenge at most federal agencies. The results of the fiscal year 2003  assessments performed by agency inspectors general or their contract  auditors under FFMIA show that these problems continue to plague the  financial management systems used by most of the CFO Act agencies.  While the problems are much more severe at some agencies than at others,  their nature and severity indicate that overall, management at most CFO  Act agencies lacks the full range of information needed for accountability,  performance reporting, and decision making. These problems include  nonintegrated financial systems, lack of accurate and timely recording of  data, inadequate reconciliation procedures, and noncompliance with  accounting standards and the U.S. Government Standard General Ledger  (SGL).", "Agencies\u2019 inability to meet the federal financial management systems  requirements continues to be the major barrier to achieving compliance  with FFMIA. Under FFMIA, CFO Act agency auditors are required to  report, as part of the agencies\u2019 financial statement audits, whether  agencies\u2019 financial management systems substantially comply with (1)  federal financial management systems requirements, (2) applicable federal  accounting standards, and (3) the SGL at the transaction level. As shown in  figure 1, auditors most frequently reported instances of noncompliance  with federal financial management systems requirements. These instances  of noncompliance involved not only core financial systems, but also  administrative and programmatic systems.", "For fiscal year 2003, auditors for 17 of the 23 CFO Act agencies reported  that the agencies\u2019 financial management systems did not comply  substantially with one or more of FFMIA\u2019s three requirements. For the  remaining 6 CFO Act agencies, auditors provided negative assurance,  meaning that nothing came to their attention indicating that the agencies\u2019  financial management systems did not substantially meet FFMIA  requirements. The auditors for these 6 agencies did not definitively state  whether the agencies\u2019 systems substantially complied with FFMIA  requirements, as is required under the statute. DHS is not subject to the  requirements of the CFO Act and, consequently, is not required to comply  with FFMIA. Accordingly, DHS\u2019s auditors did not report on DHS\u2019s  compliance with FFMIA. However, the auditors identified and reported  deficiencies that related to the aforementioned three requirements of  FFMIA.", "Federal agencies have recognized the seriousness of their financial systems  weaknesses and have efforts under way to implement or upgrade their  financial systems to alleviate long-standing problems, but some of these  efforts face significant challenges. For example, as we testified in May  2004, we have identified several issues related to NASA\u2019s financial  management systems modernization effort: (1) NASA did not involve key  stakeholders in the design and implementation of the agency\u2019s new  financial management system\u2019s core financial module; (2) NASA did not  follow key best practices for acquiring and implementing this system; and  (3) the new system lacks key external reporting capabilities for property  and budgetary data. In addition, as I will discuss later in this testimony,  DOD faces major challenges in its efforts to develop a business enterprise  architecture.

Successfully meeting this requirement is tightly linked to the  requirements for the CFO Act agencies to also have audited financial  statements. This has stimulated extensive cooperative efforts and  considerable attention by agency chief financial officers, inspectors  general, Treasury and OMB officials, and GAO. With the benefit of the past  7 years\u2019 experience by the federal government in having the required  financial statements subjected to audit, more intensified attention will be  needed on the most serious obstacles to achieving an opinion on the U.S.  government\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Three major impediments  to an opinion on the consolidated financial statements are (1) serious  financial management problems at DOD, (2) the federal government\u2019s  inability to fully account for and reconcile transactions between federal  government entities, and (3) the federal government\u2019s ineffective process  for preparing the consolidated financial statements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Financial Management at DOD", "paragraphs": ["Essential to achieving an opinion on the consolidated financial statements  is resolution of the serious financial management problems at DOD, which we have designated as high risk since 1995. In accordance with section  1008 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002, DOD  reported that for fiscal year 2003, it was not able to provide adequate  evidence supporting material amounts in its financial statements. DOD  stated that it is unable to comply with applicable financial reporting  requirements for (1) property, plant, and equipment (PP&E); (2) inventory  and operating materials and supplies; (3) environmental liabilities; (4)  intragovernmental eliminations and related accounting adjustments; (5)  disbursement activity; and (6) cost accounting by responsibility segment.  Although DOD represented that the military retirement health care liability  data had improved for fiscal year 2003, the cost of direct health care  provided by DOD-managed military treatment facilities was a significant  amount of DOD\u2019s total recorded health care liability and was based on  estimates for which adequate support was not available.", "DOD continues to confront pervasive decades-old financial management  and business problems related to its systems, processes (including internal  controls), and people (human capital). These problems preclude the  department from producing accurate, reliable, and timely information to  make sound decisions and to accurately report on its billions of dollars of  assets. DOD\u2019s long-standing business management systems problems  adversely affect the economy, effectiveness, and efficiency of its operations  and have resulted in a lack of adequate accountability across all major  business areas. To date, none of the military services or major DOD  components has passed the test of an independent financial audit because  of pervasive weaknesses in financial management systems, operations, and  controls.", "Additionally, the department\u2019s stovepiped, duplicative, and nonintegrated  systems contribute to its vulnerability to fraud, waste, and abuse. In this regard, we have recently testified on problems related to military pay and  unused airline tickets. Vulnerability to fraud, waste, and abuse continues  despite substantial systems investment. For fiscal year 2004, DOD  requested approximately $19 billion to operate, maintain, and modernize its  reported 2,274 business systems. The duplicative and stovepiped nature of  DOD\u2019s systems environment is illustrated by the numerous systems it has in  the same functional areas. For example, DOD reported that it has 565  systems to support logistics functions. These systems are not integrated  and thus have multiple points of data entry, which can result in significant  data integrity problems.", "Further, DOD continues to lack effective management oversight and  control over business systems modernization investments. The actual  funding continues to be distributed among the military services and  defense agencies, thereby enabling the numerous DOD components to  continue to develop stovepiped, parochial solutions to the department\u2019s  long-standing financial management and business operation challenges.  Lacking a departmentwide focus and effective management oversight and  control of business systems investment, DOD continues to invest billions of  dollars in systems that fail to provide integrated corporate solutions to its  long-standing business operations problems.", "Over the past 14 years, DOD has initiated several broad-based reform  efforts intended to fundamentally reform its business operations and  improve the reliability of information used in the decision-making process.  While these initiatives produced some incremental improvements, they did  not result in the fundamental reform necessary to resolve the department\u2019s  long-standing management challenges. Secretary Rumsfeld has made  business transformation a priority. For example, through its Business  Management Modernization Program, DOD is continuing its efforts to  develop and implement a business enterprise architecture and establish  effective management and control over its business system modernization  investments.", "However, we recently reported that after about 3 years of effort and over  $203 million in obligations, we have not seen significant change in the  content of DOD\u2019s architecture or in DOD\u2019s approach to investing billions of  dollars annually in existing and new systems. Few actions have been taken  to address the recommendations we made in our previous reports, which  were aimed at improving DOD\u2019s plans for developing the next version of  the architecture and implementing the institutional means for selecting and  controlling both planned and ongoing business systems investments. To  date, DOD has not addressed 22 of our 24 recommendations.", "Currently, DOD has various initiatives under way to support its efforts to  obtain an unqualified audit opinion on its fiscal year 2007 financial  statements. Because there are not yet detailed plans guiding these  activities, however, it is unclear whether and how they support each other  and whether they support this goal. Therefore, the feasibility of meeting  this goal is as yet unknown.", "The seriousness of DOD\u2019s business management weaknesses underscores  the importance of no longer condoning \u201cstatus quo\u201d business operations at  DOD. Cultural resistance to change, military service parochialism, and  stovepiped operations have all contributed significantly to the failure of  previous attempts to implement broad-based management reforms at DOD.  The department has acknowledged that it confronts decades-old problems  deeply grounded in the bureaucratic history and operating practices of a  complex, multifaceted organization and that many of these practices were  developed piecemeal and evolved to accommodate different organizations,  each with its own policies and procedures.", "To improve the likelihood that the department\u2019s current business  transformation efforts will be successful, we have previously suggested  that a chief management official position be created. Previous failed  attempts to improve DOD\u2019s business operations illustrate the need for  sustained involvement of DOD leadership in helping to assure that DOD\u2019s  financial and overall business process transformation efforts remain a  priority. While the Secretary and other key DOD leaders have demonstrated  their commitment to the current business transformation efforts, the long- term nature of these efforts requires the development of an executive  position capable of providing strong and sustained executive leadership  over a number of years and various administrations.", "This position would provide the sustained attention essential for  addressing key stewardship responsibilities such as strategic planning,  performance and financial management, and business systems  modernization in an integrated manner. This position could be filled by an  individual, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, for a  set term of 7 years with the potential for reappointment. Such an individual  should have a proven track record as a business process change agent in  large, complex, and diverse organizations\u2014experience necessary to  spearhead business process transformation across the department, and  potentially administrations, and serve as an integrator for the needed  business transformation efforts.", "Further, in a recent report we also suggest that to improve management  oversight, accountability, and control of the department\u2019s business systems  funding, Congress may wish to consider providing the funds to operate,  maintain, and modernize DOD\u2019s business systems to the functional areas,  known as domains, rather than the military services and the defense  agencies. Currently, each military service and defense agency receives its  own funding and is largely autonomous in deciding how to spend these  funds, thereby hindering the development of broad-based, integrated  corporate system solutions to common DOD-wide problems. We believe it  is critical that funds for DOD business systems be appropriated to the  domain owners in order to provide for accountability and the ability to  prevent the continued parochial approach to systems investment that  exists today. The domains would establish a hierarchy of investment review  boards with DOD-wide representation, including the military services and  defense agencies. These boards would be responsible for reviewing and  approving investments to develop, operate, maintain, and modernize  business systems for the domain portfolio, including ensuring that  investments were consistent with DOD\u2019s business enterprise architecture.", "DOD still has a long way to go, and top leadership must continue to stress  the importance of achieving lasting improvement that truly transforms the  department\u2019s business systems and operations.

In this regard, at the start of fiscal year  2003, OMB issued business rules to transform and standardize  intragovernmental ordering and billing. To address long-standing problems  with intragovernmental exchange transactions between federal agencies,  Treasury provided federal agencies with quarterly detailed trading partner  information during fiscal year 2003 to help them better perform their  trading partner reconciliations.

Figure 3 shows some selected fiscal exposures. The spectrum  of these exposures ranges from covering only the explicit liabilities that are  shown on the consolidated financial statements to implicit promises  embedded in current policy or public expectations. These liabilities,  commitments, and promises have created a fiscal imbalance that will put  unprecedented strains on the nation\u2019s spending and tax policies. Although  economic growth can help, the projected fiscal gap is now so large that the  federal government will not be able to simply grow its way out of the  problem. Tough choices are inevitable.", "Particularly troubling are the many big-ticket items that taxpayers will  eventually have to deal with. The federal government has pledged its  support to a long list of programs and activities, including pension and  health care benefits for senior citizens, medical care for veterans, and  contingencies associated with various government-sponsored entities,  whose claims on future spending total trillions of dollars. Despite their  serious implications for future budgets, tax burdens, and spending  flexibilities, these unfunded commitments get short shrift in the federal  government\u2019s current financial statements and in budgetary deliberations.", "The federal government\u2019s gross debt as of September 2003 was about $7  trillion, or about $24,000 for every man, woman, and child in this country  today. But that number excludes many big-ticket items, including the gap  between promised and funded Social Security and Medicare benefits,  veterans\u2019 health care, and a range of other commitments and contingencies.  If these items are factored in, the total burden in current dollars is at least  $42 trillion. To put that number into perspective, $42 trillion is 18 times the  current federal budget, or 3.5 times our current annual gross domestic  product. One of the biggest contributors to this total bill will be the new  Medicare prescription drug benefit, whose estimated current-dollar cost  over the next 75 years is more than $8 trillion. Stated differently, the  current total burden for every American is more than $140,000\u2014and every  day that burden is growing larger. GAO\u2019s long-term budget simulations  show that by 2040, the federal government may have to cut federal  spending by 60 percent or raise taxes to about 2.5 times today\u2019s level to pay  for the mounting cost of the federal government\u2019s current unfunded  commitments.

A top-to-bottom  review of government activities to ensure their relevance and fit for the  21st century and their relative priority is long overdue. As I have spoken  about in the past, the federal government needs a three-pronged approach  to (1) restructure existing entitlement programs, (2) reexamine the base of  discretionary and other spending, and (3) review and revise the federal  government\u2019s tax policy, including major tax preferences, and enforcement  programs.

With the  significantly accelerated financial reporting time frame for fiscal year 2004  and beyond, it is essential that the federal government move away from the  extraordinary efforts many federal agencies continue to make to prepare  financial statements and toward giving prominence to strengthening the  federal government\u2019s financial systems, reporting, and controls. This is the  only way the federal government can meet the end goal of making timely,  accurate, and useful financial and performance information routinely  available to the Congress, other policymakers, and the American public.  The requirement for timely, accurate, and useful financial and performance  management information is greater than ever as our nation faces major  long-term fiscal challenges that will require tough choices in setting  priorities and linking resources to results.", "The Congress and the President face the challenge of sorting out the many  claims on the federal budget without the budget enforcement mechanisms  or fiscal benchmarks that guided the federal government through the  previous years of deficit reduction into the brief period of surplus. While a  number of steps will be necessary to address this challenge, truth and  transparency in federal government reporting are essential elements of any  attempt to address the nation\u2019s long-term fiscal challenges. The fiscal risks  I mentioned earlier can be managed only if they are properly accounted for  and publicly disclosed. A crucial first step will be to face facts and identify  the significant commitments facing the federal government. If citizens and  federal government officials come to understand various fiscal exposures  and their potential claims on future budgets, they are more likely to insist  on prudent policy choices today and sensible levels of fiscal risk in the  future. In addition, new budget control mechanisms will be required, along  with effective approaches to successfully engage in a fundamental review,  reassessment, and reprioritization of the base of federal government  programs and policies that I have recommended previously.", "Public officials will have more incentive to make difficult but necessary  choices if the public has the facts and comes to support serious and  sustained action to address the nation\u2019s fiscal challenges. Without  meaningful public debate, however, real and lasting change is unlikely.  Clearly, the sooner action is taken, the easier it will be to turn things  around.", "I believe that nothing less than a national education campaign and outreach  effort is needed to help the public understand the nature and magnitude of  the long-term financial challenge facing this nation.
