FWS and NOAA reported paying few rewards from fiscal years 2007 through 2017. Specifically, the agencies collectively reported paying 27 rewards, totaling $205,500. Agency officials said that the information was complete to the best of their knowledge but could not sufficiently assure that this information represented all of their reward payments.", "FWS and NOAA have reward policies that outline the general process for preparing reward proposals, but FWS's policy does not specify factors for its agents to consider when developing proposed reward amounts. Some FWS agents GAO interviewed said that in developing proposals, they did not know whether their proposed reward amounts were enough, too little, or too much. By augmenting its policy to specify factors for agents to consider, FWS can better ensure that its agents have the necessary quality information to prepare proposed reward amounts, consistent with federal internal control standards.", "FWS and NOAA communicate little information to the public on rewards. For example, most agency websites did not indicate that providing information on wildlife trafficking could qualify for a reward. This is inconsistent with federal standards that call for management to communicate quality information so that external parties can help achieve agency objectives. FWS and NOAA officials said they have not communicated general reward information because of workload concerns, but they said it may be reasonable to provide more information in some instances. By developing plans to communicate more reward information to the public, the agencies can improve their chances of obtaining information on wildlife trafficking that they otherwise might not receive.", "FWS and NOAA have not reviewed the effectiveness of their use of rewards. The agencies have not done so because using rewards has generally not been a priority. FWS and NOAA officials agreed that such a review would be worthwhile but provided no plans for doing so.

Estimates place wildlife  trafficking among the top-ranked illicit types of trade alongside trafficking  in drugs, weapons, and humans; in 2016, a United Nations report  estimated the illegal trade in wildlife to be worth from $7 billion to $23  billion annually. The United States is one of the world\u2019s largest trafficking  markets and is increasingly becoming a source for illegal wildlife and  wildlife products, according to a Department of the Interior document. It  also serves as a transit point for wildlife that are illegally trafficked from  their source countries to other countries for sale.", "Wildlife trafficking undermines conservation efforts and continues to push  some protected and endangered species to the brink of extinction,  according to Department of State documents. As we have previously  found, the capture and slaughter of animals are devastating wild  populations of elephants, rhinoceroses, tigers, pangolins, turtles, exotic  birds, and many other species. Moreover, wildlife trafficking threatens  global security by fueling corruption and violence and destabilizing  communities that depend on wildlife for biodiversity and ecotourism  revenues. Wildlife trafficking can also have adverse economic impacts.  For example, the trafficking of illegally harvested timber can harm  legitimate businesses by causing products made with legally harvested  timber to be less competitive with similar products made using illegally  harvested timber.", "In recent years, the federal government has emphasized strengthening  law enforcement efforts to combat the escalating scope and scale of  wildlife trafficking. For example, in 2014, the White House released a  national strategy for combating wildlife trafficking that identified  strengthening enforcement\u2014including federal interdiction and  investigative efforts\u2014as one of three strategic priorities for the United  States. In addition, in 2017, an executive order made it executive branch  policy to strengthen enforcement of federal law to thwart the illegal  smuggling and trafficking of wildlife, among other things.", "Paying rewards to people who provide critical information about illegal  trafficking activities that leads to results, such as fines or criminal  convictions, is one of many tools that law enforcement agents can use to  help them investigate and enforce wildlife trafficking laws. Certain laws that prohibit wildlife trafficking authorize federal agencies to pay financial  rewards to people who provide information on such illegal activities. For  example, the Endangered Species Act and the Lacey Act authorize the  Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior to pay financial rewards to  people who provide information that leads to arrests, criminal convictions,  civil penalties, or property forfeitures for violations of those laws. The law  enforcement offices for the Department of the Interior\u2019s U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service (FWS) and the Department of Commerce\u2019s National  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are responsible for  enforcing certain federal laws prohibiting wildlife trafficking.

We then compared the  list provided to the results of our search of the United States Code for  such laws. To identify the extent to which FWS and NOAA have paid  financial rewards for information on wildlife trafficking, we analyzed FWS  and NOAA data on financial rewards the agencies reported paying from  fiscal years 2007 through 2017. We took steps to assess the reliability of  these data, such as interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about  the data and comparing the data to case records. Specifically, FWS and  NOAA officials said they track all expenditures, including reward  payments, in their financial databases, but they are not able to readily  identify reward payments because their financial systems do not include a  unique identifier for such payments and their reward information is  located in multiple databases and formats. As a result, FWS and NOAA  officials said they identified the rewards they reported to us by manually  reviewing their financial and law enforcement records, and officials said  the information was complete to the best of their knowledge. Based on  these steps, we found the data the agencies provided to be sufficiently  reliable for reporting information on the rewards the agencies reported  paying. However, as we discuss in the report, FWS and NOAA officials  could not provide sufficient assurance that the data included all the  financial rewards they had paid from fiscal years 2007 through 2017. To  obtain additional detail about cases where financial rewards were paid,  we reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 10 wildlife trafficking cases.  We selected these cases based on several factors, including amount of  the reward payment. While the findings from our review cannot be  generalized to cases we did not select and review, they illustrate how  FWS and NOAA have used financial rewards in wildlife trafficking cases.", "To evaluate FWS and NOAA policies on financial rewards, information  available to the public, and the extent to which FWS and NOAA reviewed  the effectiveness of their use of financial rewards in combating wildlife  trafficking, we reviewed relevant agency policies, publications, websites,  and examples of public communications on rewards for specific cases.  We also interviewed agency officials and requested any reviews the  agencies conducted regarding their use of financial rewards.

FWS and NOAA data on wildlife products  seized at U.S. ports provide examples of the diversity of illegally traded  plants, fish, and wildlife imported into or exported from the United States.  For example, from 2007 to 2016, the top 10 plant, fish, and wildlife  shipments seized nationally by FWS were coral, crocodiles, conchs, deer,  pythons, sea turtles, mollusks, ginseng, clams, and seahorses. During  that time, FWS reported that more than one-third of the wildlife shipments  it seized were confiscated while being imported from or exported to  Mexico (14 percent), China (13 percent), or Canada (9 percent).", "FWS and NOAA law enforcement offices are responsible for enforcing  certain laws and treaties prohibiting wildlife trafficking.", "FWS Office of Law Enforcement. This office enforces certain U.S.  laws and regulations as well as treaties prohibiting the trafficking of  terrestrial wildlife, freshwater species, and birds. Among other  things, the office aims to prevent the unlawful import, export, and  interstate commerce of foreign fish and wildlife, as well as to protect  U.S. plants, fish, and wildlife from unlawful exploitation. As of fiscal  year 2016, the office had a budget of $74.7 million and employed 205  special agents to investigate wildlife crime, including international and  domestic wildlife trafficking rings. Most of these special agents  report to one of eight regional offices, which receive national  oversight, support, training, and policy guidance from the FWS Office  of Law Enforcement headquarters. The office\u2019s headquarters houses  a special investigative unit focused on conducting complex, large- scale criminal investigations of wildlife traffickers. In addition, the FWS  Office of Law Enforcement has deployed special agents to serve as  international attach\u00e9s at seven U.S. embassies. These attach\u00e9s  provide countertrafficking expertise to embassy staff, work with host  government officials to build law enforcement capacity, and contribute  directly to casework or criminal investigations of wildlife traffickers.", "According to FWS data, the FWS Office of Law Enforcement opened  more than 7,000 investigations on wildlife trafficking and other illegal  activities in fiscal year 2016, including nearly 5,000 cases involving  Endangered Species Act violations and nearly 1,500 cases involving  Lacey Act violations. FWS Office of Law Enforcement investigations  have disrupted wildlife trafficking operations. For example, Operation  Crash\u2014an ongoing rhino horn and elephant ivory-trafficking  investigation launched in 2011\u2014has led to over 30 convictions and  more than $2 million in fines.", "NOAA Office of Law Enforcement. This office enforces certain U.S.  laws and regulations as well as treaties prohibiting the trafficking of  marine wildlife, including fish, as well as anadromous fish. Among  other things, the office aims to prevent the illegal, unregulated, and  unreported harvesting and trade of fish as well as the trafficking of  protected marine wildlife. As of fiscal year 2016, the office had a  budget of $68.6 million and employed 77 special agents to investigate  wildlife crimes within its jurisdiction. These agents report to one of  five regional offices, and those offices receive national oversight,  support, and policy guidance from the NOAA Office of Law  Enforcement headquarters.", "According to NOAA data, the NOAA Office of Law Enforcement  initiated more than 5,000 investigations in fiscal year 2016. About half  of those investigations involved violations of the Magnuson-Stevens  Fishery Conservation and Management Act, as amended, and some  of the 5,000 investigations involved violations of the Endangered  Species Act or the Lacey Act. NOAA Office of Law Enforcement  investigations have disrupted wildlife trafficking operations. For  example, in fiscal year 2016, a NOAA Office of Law Enforcement  investigation led to the conviction of a company and five individuals  for illegally trafficking whale bone carvings, walrus ivory carvings,  black coral carvings, and other products derived from protected  species into the United States.", "The FWS and NOAA law enforcement offices collaborate with other  government agencies and organizations to combat wildlife trafficking.  Both agencies work with other federal, state, and tribal law enforcement  officers as well as their international counterparts as needed during  wildlife trafficking investigations. For example, FWS and NOAA work with  U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to maintain import  and export controls and interdict smuggled wildlife and related products at  U.S. ports of entry. In addition, FWS and NOAA collaborate with  Department of Justice prosecutors on criminal cases that result from  agency investigations.", "Both agencies also collaborate with nongovernmental organizations to  combat wildlife trafficking. For example, FWS and NOAA officials said  that nongovernmental organizations have, in some cases, offered  financial rewards (in addition to rewards offered by FWS and NOAA) for  information on a wildlife crime. In addition, some nongovernmental  organizations proactively provide information to FWS and NOAA on  wildlife trafficking activities in the United States or foreign countries that  violate U.S. laws. For example, in 2017, a nongovernmental  organization created a website to collect tips on wildlife crime and to  connect the sources of those tips with relevant U.S. authorities for  potential financial rewards.", "FWS may pay financial rewards from moneys in two accounts.", "Law Enforcement Reward Account.

The Department of State may also pay  rewards under certain circumstances, including for information leading to  the disruption of financial mechanisms of a transnational criminal group.  Similarly, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may pay rewards for information about  violations of federal securities laws and the underpayment of taxes,  respectively, if certain conditions are met.

But, for  reasons unknown to the agent, his supervisor reduced the amount to  $1,000.

Two stakeholders expressed  concern that some of FWS\u2019s reward payments were insufficient,  especially when comparing the amount of time and effort or the risk a  source faced in providing the information. A couple of stakeholders also  said that without a policy that specifies factors for agents to consider,  reward amounts may be subjective and could vary depending on which  agent develops the reward proposal. Another stakeholder said that it was  important to specify factors for agents to consider when developing  proposed reward amounts so that the agency has a reasonable and  defensible basis for the reward amounts it pays across cases.", "According to federal standards for internal control, management should  internally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve an  agency\u2019s objectives.

However, they also agreed that it may be  helpful to review their policy but did not commit to doing so.

Specifically, some FWS and NOAA law enforcement  websites provided information to the public on ways to report violations of  the laws that the agencies are responsible for enforcing, such as via tip  lines. Some of the websites also provided examples of the types of  information the public can report, such as photos or other documentation  of illegal activities. However, most of the agencies\u2019 websites did not  indicate that providing information on illegal activities could result in a  reward. In contrast, the FWS Alaska regional office\u2019s website provided  information on the potential availability of rewards and ways the public  may submit information for a potential reward. For example, this website  provided phone numbers and an e-mail address for the public to use  when submitting information. Figure 1 shows the information available on  FWS\u2019s and NOAA\u2019s national and regional websites relevant to reporting  violations of the laws the agencies enforce in general and on receiving  rewards in particular.", "In addition, FWS and NOAA headquarters officials said their field agents  have used other means to communicate the potential availability of  rewards in specific cases when the agents had no other information that  could help solve those cases. For example, a FWS field official said that  the agency advertised a reward offer for information on a case of bald  eagle killings by distributing reward posters and posting news releases in  the vicinity where the killings occurred. Similarly, NOAA officials said they  have advertised reward offers through various means, including  circulating reward posters in specific geographic areas after an illegal  activity has occurred. Figure 2 shows a reward poster that NOAA  distributed in Guam in 2017 advertising a $1,000 reward for information  leading to the arrest and conviction of sea turtle poachers.", "Instead of having a plan for communicating general information to the  public on rewards, FWS and NOAA grant discretion to their regional  offices and law enforcement agents to determine the type and level of  communication to provide, according to FWS and NOAA policies. FWS  officials explained that because they typically use financial rewards to  thank individuals who come forward on their own accord\u2014rather than  using rewards to incentivize individuals with information to come  forward\u2014they have not seen the need to communicate more information  to the public on the potential availability of rewards. NOAA officials said  they have targeted their communications on rewards by publicizing  reward offers for specific cases where they do not have leads. They  added that they want to receive quality information and already receive a  substantial amount of information from sources who reach out to them  proactively, so NOAA has not seen the need to communicate more  information to the public on the potential availability of rewards.", "Sixteen of the 20 stakeholders we interviewed said that it would be useful  for FWS and NOAA to advertise the potential availability of financial  rewards. Several stakeholders said that if the public does not know about  the possibility for rewards, then some people with information may not be  incentivized to come forward. Two stakeholders added that agencies  should carefully consider how and which reward information to  communicate to the public so that people who are most likely to have  information on illegal wildlife trafficking learn about the potential for  rewards. For example, one stakeholder suggested advertising rewards at  ports where international shipments are offloaded or placing  advertisements at wildlife trafficking nodes, such as entrances to African  wildlife refuges. This stakeholder suggested advertising rewards along  with wildlife trafficking awareness-raising posters that nongovernment  organizations place in some airports.", "In addition, 14 stakeholders suggested that it would be useful for FWS  and NOAA to provide information to the public on the process for  submitting information to potentially receive rewards. Several other  stakeholders said that it is important for the public to understand whether  they may be eligible for a reward, how to submit information, and whether  or to what extent their confidentiality will be protected. Another  stakeholder provided examples of how other agencies provide information  about their reward programs on their websites. SEC and IRS, for  instance, use their websites to communicate information to the public on  the process for reporting illegal activity for financial rewards. This  information includes the types of information to report, confidentiality  rules, eligibility criteria, and the process for submitting information to  obtain a reward. In addition, the Department of State posts instructions on  its websites on how to submit information on an illegal activity and  potentially receive a reward.", "Federal internal control standards say that management should externally  communicate the necessary quality information to achieve an agency\u2019s  objectives. For example, using appropriate methods to communicate,  management communicates quality information so that external parties,  such as the public, can help the agency achieve its objectives. This could  include communicating information to the public on the types of  information and eligibility requirements for potentially receiving rewards  for reporting information on wildlife trafficking.", "FWS officials said that making more reward information available could  lead to a significant increase in the amount of information the agency  receives, which, in turn, could strain FWS\u2019s resources in following up on  that information. However, FWS officials also agreed that it was  reasonable to consider making more reward information available to  relevant members of the public, particularly in targeted circumstances, but  did not commit to doing so. Similarly, NOAA officials said they had some  concerns about the additional resources it might take to investigate  potentially unreliable or false tips that may result if they make reward  information broadly available to the public, but they agreed that it would  be reasonable for the agency to consider doing so. NOAA officials also  said they may consider making more reward information publicly available  at the conclusion of our audit but provided no plans for doing so. By  determining the types of additional information to communicate to the  public on rewards\u2014such as providing information on the agency\u2019s  website on the potential availability of rewards\u2014and then developing and  implementing plans to do so, FWS and NOAA can improve their chances  of obtaining information on wildlife trafficking activities that they otherwise  might not receive."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FWS and NOAA Have Not Reviewed the Effectiveness of Their Use of Financial Rewards", "paragraphs": ["FWS and NOAA have not reviewed the effectiveness of their use of  financial rewards or considered whether any changes might improve the  usefulness of rewards as a tool for combating wildlife trafficking. FWS  officials said their agency has not reviewed or considered changes to its  use of rewards because the agency has not prioritized the use of  rewards. NOAA officials said their agency has not focused on using  rewards or identified the need to review its use of this tool, particularly in  light of other, higher mission priorities.", "Nine of the 20 stakeholders we interviewed said that FWS and NOAA  should review the effectiveness of their use of rewards and consider  potential improvements. Several stakeholders said that it would be useful  for FWS and NOAA to compare their respective approaches to those of  federal agencies that use rewards in contexts outside of wildlife trafficking  to identify best practices or lessons learned that might be applicable in  the context of combating wildlife trafficking. For example, one stakeholder  said that SEC has an effective whistleblower program and may have  lessons learned that are relevant for FWS and NOAA to consider.  Another stakeholder we interviewed separately indicated that in 2010,  before SEC had a whistleblower program that publicized rewards and  provided detailed instructions on how members of the public could report  information on illegal activities, SEC received few tips. Once SEC  implemented a whistleblower program that publicized rewards and  provided detailed instructions on its public website, the agency\u2019s use of  the program grew substantially, according to the stakeholder. Other  stakeholders said it would be useful for the agencies to consider potential  improvements to their use of rewards, such as making a standing reward  offer for information on wildlife trafficking targeted at high-priority  endangered species or particular criminal networks. Two of these  stakeholders said such an offer might improve FWS\u2019s and NOAA\u2019s use of  rewards by generating more tips than reward offers focused on individual  cases. At the same time, they said such an offer would likely filter out  some of the false or unproductive tips that the agencies might receive if  they made an untargeted standing reward offer.", "Federal internal control standards state that management should design  control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks by, for  example, conducting reviews at the functional or activity level by  comparing actual performance to planned or expected results and  analyzing significant differences. Further, under the standards,  management should periodically review policies, procedures, and related  control activities for continued relevance and effectiveness in achieving  an agency\u2019s objectives or addressing related risks. FWS and NOAA  officials agreed that reviewing the effectiveness of their use of rewards  would be worthwhile. Specifically, FWS officials said that it would be  useful to compare their approach to those of other federal agencies that  use rewards in investigating crimes that involve interstate and foreign  smuggling of goods. Similarly, NOAA officials said that reviewing the  agency\u2019s use of financial rewards would be worthwhile but cautioned that  such a review would need to be balanced against the agency\u2019s  constrained resources and many mission requirements. FWS and NOAA  officials said they may consider conducting such a review at the  conclusion of our audit but provided no plans for doing so. By reviewing  the effectiveness of their use of rewards, FWS and NOAA can identify  opportunities to improve the usefulness of rewards as a tool for  combating wildlife trafficking."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Wildlife trafficking is a large and growing transnational criminal activity,  with global environmental, security, and economic consequences. The  federal government has emphasized strengthening law enforcement  efforts to combat wildlife trafficking, and using financial rewards to obtain  information on illegal activities is one tool that some federal agencies  have used. However, to date, FWS and NOAA have not prioritized the  use of rewards and were unable to provide sufficient assurance that the  27 rewards they paid during fiscal years 2007 through 2017 represented  all of the rewards they provided during that period. By tracking reward  information so that it is clearly documented and readily available for  examination, FWS and NOAA can better ensure that they have complete  information on the rewards they have paid to help manage their use of  rewards as a law enforcement tool.", "Additionally, FWS and NOAA have policies outlining the processes their  law enforcement agents are to use in making reward payments, and  NOAA\u2019s policy specifies factors for its agents to consider in developing  proposed reward amounts, such as the risk the individual took in  collecting the information. FWS\u2019s policy does not specify such factors that  could inform agents in achieving the agency\u2019s objectives, which is not  consistent with federal internal control standards. By augmenting its  policy to specify factors for its agents to consider when developing  proposed reward amounts, FWS can better ensure that its agents have  the necessary quality information to prepare defensible reward proposals.", "Both agencies have also advertised the potential for rewards in specific  cases when agents had no other information, but FWS and NOAA have  otherwise communicated little information to the public on the potential  availability of rewards.

We also interviewed officials from federal agencies that play a  role in combating wildlife trafficking or manage programs that pay  financial rewards for information on illegal activities. Specifically, we  interviewed officials from the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce,  Homeland Security, the Interior, Justice, and State, as well as officials  from the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Securities and Exchange  Commission, and the U.S. Agency for International Development. In  addition, we reviewed documentation that the Department of the Treasury  provided on its role in paying financial rewards. We did not compare  FWS\u2019s and NOAA\u2019s use of financial rewards in combating wildlife  trafficking to federal agencies\u2019 use of financial rewards in other contexts  because the different contexts are not directly comparable. However, we  reviewed information on other federal agencies\u2019 use of financial rewards  as examples of how financial rewards are used in contexts outside of  wildlife trafficking. In addition, we interviewed representatives of six  nongovernmental organizations that we selected based on those  organizations\u2019 knowledge or experience in combating wildlife trafficking.", "Specifically, we interviewed representatives from the Elephant Action  League, the Environmental Investigation Agency, the National  Association of Conservation Law Enforcement Chiefs, the National  Whistleblower Center, TRAFFIC, and the World Wildlife Fund.", "To identify laws that authorize FWS and NOAA to pay financial rewards  for information on wildlife trafficking, we asked FWS and NOAA attorneys  to compile a list of laws that each of their agencies implements or  enforces that prohibit wildlife trafficking and authorize the agency to pay  rewards for providing information about trafficking. We then compared  that list to the results of our search of the United States Code for such  laws. We also reviewed FWS and NOAA documentation for accounts  where the fines, penalties, and proceeds from forfeited property that are  used to pay rewards are deposited as well as the accounts where  appropriations available to pay rewards were deposited. To identify the  extent to which FWS and NOAA have paid financial rewards for  information on wildlife trafficking, we analyzed FWS and NOAA data on  financial rewards the agencies reported paying from fiscal years 2007  through 2017. The data included information on, among other things,  the fiscal years in which rewards were paid,  laws under which rewards were paid,  types of wildlife involved in those cases,  the amounts of civil penalties or criminal fines imposed in those  cases,  the numbers of arrests and convictions as a result of those cases, and whether reward recipients were individuals or groups and U.S. or  foreign citizens.", "To assess the reliability of the data FWS and NOAA provided on financial  rewards, we interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about the data  and compared the data to case records the agencies provided.", "Specifically, FWS and NOAA officials said they track all expenditures,  including reward payments, in their financial databases, but they are not  able to readily identify reward payments because their financial systems  do not include a unique identifier for such payments and their reward  information is located in multiple databases and formats. As a result,  FWS and NOAA officials said they identified the rewards that they  reported to us by manually reviewing their financial and law enforcement  records, and officials said the information was complete to the best of  their knowledge. Based on these steps, we found the data that the  agencies provided to us to be sufficiently reliable for reporting information  on the rewards the agencies reported paying. However, as we discuss in  the report, FWS and NOAA officials could not provide sufficient  assurance that the data included all the financial rewards that they had  paid from fiscal years 2007 through 2017.", "To obtain additional detail about cases where financial rewards were  paid, we reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 10 wildlife trafficking  cases. We selected these cases based on  the agency that investigated the case (to include both FWS and  NOAA cases),  the amount of the reward paid in the case (to reflect both low and high  amounts),  the year in which the reward was paid (to include rewards paid more  recently), and  the type of wildlife trafficked in the case (to include both fish and  wildlife cases\u2014there were no plant trafficking cases to select).", "While the findings from our review cannot be generalized to cases we did  not select and review, they illustrate how FWS and NOAA have used  financial rewards in wildlife trafficking cases.", "To evaluate FWS and NOAA policies on financial rewards, we reviewed  relevant FWS and NOAA policies and compared them to each other;  interviewed FWS and NOAA officials about those policies; and compared  the information in the policies with federal internal control standards on  information and communication. To evaluate information available to the  public on rewards, we reviewed relevant FWS and NOAA publications  and examples of communications to the public on the availability of  rewards in specific cases and interviewed FWS and NOAA officials. We  also reviewed information available on FWS\u2019s and NOAA\u2019s national and  regional websites as of December 2017 and January 2018, respectively,  relevant to reporting violations of the laws that the agencies enforce in  general and on receiving rewards in particular. We compared the  agencies\u2019 public communications on rewards with federal internal control  standards on information and communication. To evaluate the extent to  which FWS and NOAA reviewed the effectiveness of their use of financial  rewards in combating wildlife trafficking, we interviewed FWS and NOAA  officials and requested any reviews the agencies had conducted  regarding their use of financial rewards to compare with federal internal  control standards on control activities. FWS and NOAA did not have any  such reviews to provide.", "In addition, for all four objectives, we interviewed a nongeneralizable  sample of 20 stakeholders who had experience investigating wildlife  trafficking or expertise in the use of financial rewards as a law  enforcement tool. To select stakeholders to interview, we first identified a  list of stakeholders by reviewing (1) FWS and NOAA data on law  enforcement agents with at least 5 years of experience who had  investigated wildlife trafficking cases and used financial rewards, (2)  Department of Justice data on federal prosecutors who had prosecuted  wildlife trafficking cases since fiscal year 2014, (3) literature search  results identifying academics with expertise in the use of financial rewards  as a law enforcement tool and federal programs that use financial  rewards to combat illegal activities in contexts outside of wildlife  trafficking, (4) the biographies of members of the federal Advisory Council  on Wildlife Trafficking, and (5) recommendations from stakeholders we  interviewed. From this list, we then used a multistep process to select the  20 stakeholders to interview. To ensure coverage and a range of  perspectives, we selected stakeholders from the following groups:", "FWS and NOAA law enforcement agents, including field and  federal prosecutors responsible for prosecuting wildlife trafficking  cases;  federal officials responsible for programs that use financial rewards to  combat illegal activities in contexts outside of wildlife trafficking; academics with expertise in the use of financial rewards as a law members of the federal Advisory Council on Wildlife Trafficking; and  representatives of nongovernmental organizations that investigate  wildlife trafficking.", "We conducted semistructured interviews with the 20 selected  stakeholders using a standard set of questions. We asked questions  about stakeholder views on the usefulness of financial rewards in  combating wildlife trafficking; the strength and weaknesses of the  statutory provisions that authorize federal agencies to pay financial  rewards for information on wildlife trafficking; FWS\u2019s and NOAA\u2019s use of  financial rewards to combat wildlife trafficking; and how, if at all, the two  agencies could improve their use of financial rewards to combat wildlife  trafficking. We analyzed the stakeholders\u2019 responses to our questions,  grouping the responses into overall themes.
