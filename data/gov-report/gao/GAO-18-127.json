For example, the 94 consumers in 12 focus groups that GAO conducted used this information to decide whether to repair their vehicles. These consumers overwhelmingly cited safety risk and convenience as the two most influential factors they considered. Most consumers reported a preference for receiving recall notification by at least one electronic means, such as by e-mail or text message, in addition to mail. However, only 7 of 94 consumers reported receiving electronic notifications, suggesting a gap between the industry's auto recall notification practices and consumers' preferences. (See fig.). In response to a mandate in law, in September 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would require manufacturers to notify consumers about auto recalls by electronic means in addition to mail.", "Most consumers in GAO's focus group website usability tests found the auto recall areas of NHTSA's website\u2014NHTSA.gov\u2014easy to use; however, some consumers experienced difficulties when asked to complete auto recall related tasks. For example, when consumers attempted to search for recalls affecting their specific vehicles, some found the search results confusing, leading them to question the accuracy of the results. Similarly, some consumers were hampered in searching for recalls by their vehicles' year, make, and model because the website did not always display model options using plain language. GAO found that the auto recall areas of NHTSA.gov do not always reflect federal and industry key website usability practices, and that an independent evaluation conducted by website usability professionals at GAO's request identified similar issues. NHTSA is in the process of consolidating its websites and plans to conduct a website usability study of NHTSA.gov with consumers after the consolidation is complete. However, the agency has not determined a completion date for the consolidation effort\u2014an essential step for organizations to effectively guide their information technology efforts.

This increase is driven in part by  several large-scale recalls, such as the ongoing recall of 34 million  vehicles with defective Takata air bag inflators that have caused at least  13 deaths and more than 220 injuries in the United States.", "Auto recalls seek to address a wide variety of safety risks, such as wiring  system problems that may result in vehicle fires or windshield wiper  assemblies that fail to operate properly. When safety defects are  identified, auto manufacturers are required to notify consumers and  remedy (repair) the problem without charge. The National Highway Traffic  Safety Administration (NHTSA) monitors the percentage of defective  vehicles that manufacturers ultimately remedy (completion rates).  However, according to NHTSA\u2019s Strategic Plan 2016\u20132020, auto recall  completion rates are unacceptably low, leaving vehicles with potentially  deadly safety defects on the road.

Each focus group was split into two sessions: (1) a discussion  session to explore participants\u2019 thoughts, experiences, and preferences  about auto recall information and (2) a session to test the usability of the  auto recall areas of NHTSA.gov. We conducted focus groups at six  locations across the country to provide population and geographic  dispersion, with each group including 7 or 8 consumers for a total of 94  participants. Half of the focus groups were comprised of consumers who  had completed the repair and the remaining half included consumers who  had not completed the repair.

We also interviewed four  franchised dealerships and three independent auto dealerships across  the country. The results of these interviews are not generalizable to all  auto manufacturers and dealerships, but provide insights about how  some industry stakeholders use auto recall information.

See appendix II for  an example of a notification letter.", "The number of vehicles affected by safety defect vehicle recalls has  increased dramatically since 2011 (see fig. 1). The increase reflects, in  part, several large-scale recalls. For example, in 2014, General Motors  initiated a recall of over 8 million vehicles with faulty ignition switches.  Similarly, according to NHTSA in 2014 and 2015, some passenger  vehicle manufacturers began recalling Takata air bag inflators, recalls that  have grown to include approximately 34 million vehicles and 19 auto  manufacturers. For the Takata recall, NHTSA issued various orders and  established a Coordinated Remedy Program under which the agency  oversees the supply of remedy parts and risk-based prioritization of  vehicles for repair, and manages related recalls with the assistance of an  Independent Monitor. The Independent Monitor assesses compliance  with the applicable orders issued by NHTSA and makes  recommendations aimed at enhancing the remedy program.", "According to NHTSA\u2019s Strategic Plan 2016\u20132020, this unprecedented  recall activity encouraged the agency to improve its system for identifying  and addressing defective vehicles. For example, the plan states that  NHTSA\u2019s \u201cvision is to achieve a 100-percent completion rate for every  recall by improving communication at every level, at every step of the  way.\u201d Thus, according to the plan, NHTSA and the auto industry have  committed to identifying and implementing effective strategies to inform  consumers of safety defects and envision that their coordination will  bolster recall efforts to improve completion rates.", "NHTSA reported that annual completion rates for passenger vehicle  recalls have remained relatively flat, ranging from 63 to 67 percent  between calendar year 2011 and calendar year 2014. See appendix III  for completion rates by vehicle component and vehicle type. In part, to  improve communication and encourage consumers to complete repairs,  NHTSA and manufacturers provide auto recall information to the public  on their websites. For example, certain motor vehicle manufacturers are  required to allow consumers to search a vehicle\u2019s recall remedy status on  the Internet using the vehicle identification number (VIN). NHTSA also  provides publicly available auto recall information on its website, including  examples of recall notification letters.", "In December 2016, NHTSA began consolidating its websites into  NHTSA.gov to provide a single access point for its auto recall content.  One of these websites, safercar.gov, was once NHTSA\u2019s primary method  of communicating auto recall information to consumers; however, the  agency is in the process of moving this information to NHTSA.gov.  NHTSA\u2019s Strategic Plan 2016\u20132020 states that the agency wants  NHTSA.gov to be a comprehensive user-friendly platform that serves as  the premier source of vehicle safety information by, for example,  improving the website\u2019s search capabilities.
