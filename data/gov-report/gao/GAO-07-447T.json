In August 1997,  Congress created SCHIP with the goal of significantly reducing the  number of low-income uninsured children. Prior to SCHIP, approximately  19 million Medicaid beneficiaries were children, and combined federal and  state expenditures on their behalf totaled $32 billion. However, there  remained an estimated 9 million to 11.6 million children who were  uninsured at some time during 1997. SCHIP was established to provide  health coverage to uninsured children in families whose incomes  exceeded the eligibility requirements for Medicaid. Without health  insurance coverage, children are less likely to obtain routine medical or  dental care, establish a relationship with a primary care physician, and  receive immunizations or treatment for injuries and chronic illnesses.", "SCHIP offers states flexibility in how they provide health insurance  coverage to children. States implementing SCHIP have three approaches  in designing their programs: (1) a Medicaid expansion, which affords  SCHIP-eligible children the same benefits and services that a state\u2019s  Medicaid program provides; (2) a separate child health program distinct  from Medicaid that uses, for example, specified public or private  insurance plans; and (3) a combination program, which has a Medicaid  expansion and a separate child health program. At the time of enactment,  Congress appropriated a fixed amount of funds\u2014approximately   $40 billion from 1998 through 2007\u2014to be distributed among states with  approved SCHIP plans. Unlike Medicaid, SCHIP is not an entitlement to  services for beneficiaries, but a capped grant\u2014or allotment\u2014to states.  SCHIP funds are allocated annually to the 50 states, the District of  Columbia, and the U.S. commonwealths and territories. Each state\u2019s  annual SCHIP allotment is available as a federal match based on state  expenditures and is available for 3 years, after which time any unspent  funds may be redistributed to states that have already spent their  allotments.", "As Congress considers reauthorization of the SCHIP program, my remarks  will address (1) recent data regarding trends in SCHIP enrollment and the  estimated number of children who remain uninsured, (2) the current  composition of SCHIP programs\u2014including their overall design\u2014across  the states, (3) states\u2019 spending experiences under SCHIP, and (4) issues  we have identified for consideration during SCHIP reauthorization. My  testimony is based on prior GAO work; analysis of the Current Population  Survey (CPS) data (from 2003 through 2005), which is a monthly survey  conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor statistics;  information obtained from states\u2019 annual SCHIP reports (from fiscal year  2002 through 2005); and SCHIP enrollment and expenditure data (from  fiscal year 1998 through 2005), from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),  which oversees states\u2019 Medicaid and SCHIP programs.

Additional flexibility  regarding eligibility levels is available, however, as Medicaid and SCHIP  provide some flexibility in how a state defines income for purposes of  eligibility determinations. Congress appropriated approximately   $40 billion over 10 years (from fiscal year 1998 through 2007) for  distribution among states with approved SCHIP plans. Allocations to  states are based on a formula that takes into account the number of low- income children in a state. In general, states that choose to expand  Medicaid to enroll eligible children under SCHIP must follow Medicaid  rules, while separate child health programs have additional flexibilities in  benefits, cost-sharing, and other program elements.

Under federal SCHIP law and subject  to certain exceptions, states have 3 years to use each fiscal year\u2019s  allocation, after which any remaining funds are redistributed among the  states that had used all of that fiscal year\u2019s allocation. Federal law does  not specify a redistribution formula but leaves it to the Secretary of Health  and Human Services to determine an appropriate procedure for  redistribution of unused allocations. Absent congressional action, states  are generally provided 1 year to spend any redistributed funds, after which  time funds may revert to the U.S. Treasury. Each state\u2019s SCHIP allotment  is available as a federal match based on state expenditures. SCHIP offers a  strong incentive for states to participate by providing an enhanced federal  matching rate that is based on the federal matching rate for a state\u2019s  Medicaid program\u2014for example, the federal government will reimburse at  a 65 percent match under SCHIP for a state receiving a 50 percent match  under Medicaid.", "There are different formulas for allocating funds to states, depending on  the fiscal year. For fiscal years 1998 and 1999, the formula used estimates  of the number of low-income uninsured children to allocate funds to  states.

Initially, states had until   September 30, 1998, to select a design approach, submit their SCHIP plans,  and obtain HHS approval in order to qualify for their fiscal year 1998  allotment. With an approved state child health plan, a state could begin to  enroll children and draw down its SCHIP funds.", "The design approach a state chooses has important financial and  programmatic consequences, as shown below.", "Expenditures. In separate child health programs, federal matching funds  cease after a state expends its allotment, and non-benefit-related expenses  (for administration, direct services, and outreach) are limited to 10 percent  of claims for services delivered to beneficiaries. In contrast, Medicaid  expansion programs may continue to receive federal funds for benefits  and for non-benefit-related expenses at the Medicaid matching rate after  states exhaust their SCHIP allotments.", "Enrollment. Separate child health programs may establish separate  eligibility rules and establish enrollment caps. In addition, a separate child  health program may limit its own annual contribution, create waiting lists,  or stop enrollment once the funds it budgeted for SCHIP are exhausted. A  Medicaid expansion must follow Medicaid eligibility rules regarding  income, residency, and disability status, and thus cannot limit enrollment.", "Benefits. Separate child health programs must use, for example,  benchmark benefit standards that use specified private or public insurance  plans as the basis for coverage. However, Medicaid\u2014and therefore a  Medicaid expansion\u2014must provide coverage of all benefits available to  the Medicaid population, including certain services for children. In  particular, Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment  (EPSDT) requires states to cover treatments or stabilize conditions  diagnosed during routine screenings\u2014regardless of whether the benefit  would otherwise be covered under the state\u2019s Medicaid program. A  separate child health program does not require EPSDT coverage.", "Beneficiary cost-sharing. Separate child health programs may impose  limited cost-sharing\u2014through premiums, copayments, or enrollment  fees\u2014for children in families with incomes above 150 percent of FPL up to  5 percent of family income annually.

The cost-effectiveness test  requires the states to demonstrate that covering both adults and children  in a family under SCHIP is no more expensive than covering only the  children. The states may also elect to cover children whose parents have  access to employer-based or private health insurance coverage by using  SCHIP funding to subsidize the cost.", "Second, under section 1115 of the Social Security Act, states may receive  approval to waive certain Medicaid or SCHIP requirements. The Secretary  of Health and Human Services may approve waivers of statutory  requirements in the case of experimental, pilot, or demonstration projects  that are likely to promote program objectives. In August 2001, HHS  indicated that it would allow states greater latitude in using section 1115  demonstration projects (or waivers) to modify their Medicaid and SCHIP  programs and that it would expedite consideration of state proposals.

Of these 6.1 million enrollees, 639,000 were adults.

There is  research indicating that if cost-sharing is too high, or imposed on families  whose income is too low, it can impede access to care and create financial  burdens for families.", "In 2005, states\u2019 annual SCHIP reports showed that 39 states had some type  of cost-sharing\u2014premiums, copayments, or enrollment fees\u2014while 11  states reported no cost-sharing in their SCHIP programs. Overall, 16 states  charged premiums and copayments, 14 states charged premiums only, and  9 states charged copayments only (see fig. 5).", "Cost-sharing occurred more frequently in the separate child health  programs than in Medicaid expansion programs. For example, 8 states  with Medicaid expansion programs had cost-sharing requirements,  compared with 34 states operating separate child health program  components. The amount of premiums charged varied considerably  among the states that charged cost-sharing. For example, premiums  ranged from $5.00 per family per month for children in families with  incomes from 150 to 200 percent of FPL in Michigan to $117 per family per  month for children in families with incomes from 300 to 350 percent of  FPL in New Jersey. Federal SCHIP law prohibits states from imposing  cost-sharing on SCHIP-eligible children that totals more than 5 percent of  family income annually. In addition, cost-sharing for children may be  imposed on the basis of family income. For example, we earlier reported  that in 2003, Virginia SCHIP copayments for children in families with  incomes from 133 percent to below 150 percent of FPL were $2 per  physician visit or per prescription and $5 for services for children in  families with higher incomes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Few States Offer Premium Assistance Programs", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2005, nine states reported operating premium assistance  programs (see table 2), but implementation remains a challenge.

To be eligible for SCHIP, a child must not be  covered under any other health coverage program or have private health  insurance. However, some uninsured children may live in families with  access to employer-sponsored health insurance coverage. Therefore,  states may choose to establish premium assistance programs, where the  state uses SCHIP funds to contribute to health insurance premium  payments. To the extent that such coverage is not equivalent to the  states\u2019 Medicaid or SCHIP level of benefits, including limited cost-sharing,  states are required to pay for supplemental benefits and cost-sharing to  make up this difference.  Under certain section 1115 waivers, however,  states have not been required to provide this supplemental coverage to  participants.", "Several states reported facing challenges implementing their premium  assistance programs. Louisiana, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Virginia  cited administration of the program as labor intensive. For example,  Massachusetts noted that it is a challenge to maintain current information  on program participants\u2019 employment status, choice of health plan, and  employer contributions, but such information is needed to ensure accurate  premium payments. Two states\u2014Rhode Island and Wisconsin\u2014noted the  challenges of operating premium assistance programs, given changes in  employer-sponsored health plans and accompanying costs.

Fifteen of the 18  shortfall states (83 percent) had Medicaid expansion programs or  combination programs that included Medicaid expansions, which must  follow Medicaid rules, such as providing the full Medicaid benefit package  and continuing to provide coverage to all eligible individuals even after the  states\u2019 SCHIP allotments are exhausted. The shortfall states tended to  have a broader eligibility corridor in their SCHIP programs, indicating that,  on average, the shortfall states covered children in SCHIP from lower  income levels, from higher income levels, or both.

States themselves have offered a variety of reasons for shortfalls and  surpluses. These examples, while not exhaustive, highlight a few factors  that have shaped states\u2019 financial circumstances under SCHIP, including  the following:    Inaccuracies in the CPS-based estimates on which states\u2019  allotments were based. North Carolina, a shortfall state, offers a case in  point. In 2004, the state had more low-income children enrolled in the  program than CPS estimates indicated were eligible. To curb spending,  North Carolina shifted children through age 5 from the state\u2019s separate  program to a Medicaid expansion, reduced provider payments, and limited  enrollment growth.", "Annual funding levels that did not reflect enrollment growth. Iowa,  another shortfall state, noted that annual allocations provided too many  funds in the early years of the program and too few in the later years.

When  enrollment began to decline, the state reinstituted open enrollment and  outreach.

Yet, the states and the federal government  face challenges in their efforts to continue to finance health care coverage  for children. As health care consumes a growing share of state general  fund or operating budgets, slowdowns in economic growth can affect  states\u2019 abilities\u2014and efforts\u2014to address the demand for public financing  of health services. Moreover, without substantive programmatic or  revenue changes, the federal government faces near- and long-term fiscal  challenges as the U.S. population ages because spending for retirement  and health care programs will grow dramatically. Given these  circumstances, we would like to suggest several issues for consideration  as Congress addresses the reauthorization of SCHIP. These include the  following:    Maintaining flexibility without compromising the goals of SCHIP.", "The federal-state SCHIP partnership has provided an important  opportunity for innovation on the part of states for the overall benefit of  children\u2019s health. Providing three design choices for states\u2014Medicaid  expansions, separate child health programs, or a combination of both  approaches\u2014affords them the opportunity to focus on their own unique  and specific priorities. For example, expansions of Medicaid offer  Medicaid\u2019s comprehensive benefits and administrative structures and  ensure children\u2019s coverage if states exhaust their SCHIP allotments.  However, this entitlement status also increases financial risk to states. In  contrast, SCHIP separate child health programs offer a \u201cblock grant\u201d  approach to covering children. As long as the states meet statutory  requirements, they have the flexibility to structure coverage on an  employer-based health plan model and can better control program  spending than they can with a Medicaid expansion.", "However, flexibility within the SCHIP program, such as that available  through section 1115 waivers, may also result in consequences that can  run counter to SCHIP\u2019s goal\u2014covering children. For example, we  identified 14 states that have authority to cover adults with their federal  SCHIP funds, with several states covering more adults than children.  States\u2019 rationale is that covering low-income parents in public programs  such as SCHIP and Medicaid increases the enrollment of eligible children  as well, with the result that fewer children go uninsured. Federal SCHIP  law provides that families may be covered only if such coverage is cost- effective; that is, covering families costs no more than covering the SCHIP- eligible children. We earlier reported that HHS had approved state  proposals for section 1115 waivers to use SCHIP funds to cover parents of  SCHIP- and Medicaid-eligible children without regard to cost- effectiveness. We also reported that HHS approved state proposals for  section 1115 waivers to use SCHIP funds to cover childless adults, which  in our view was inconsistent with federal SCHIP law and allowed SCHIP  funds to be diverted from the needs of low-income children. We  suggested that Congress consider amending the SCHIP statute to specify  that SCHIP funds were not available to provide health insurance coverage  for childless adults. Under the DRA, Congress prohibited the Secretary of  Health and Human Services from approving any new section 1115 waivers  to cover nonpregnant childless adults after October 1, 2005, but allowed  waivers approved prior to that date to continue.", "It is important to consider the implications of states\u2019 use of allowable  flexibility for other aspects of their programs. For example, what  assurances exist that SCHIP funds are being spent in the most cost- effective manner, as required under federal law? In view of current federal  fiscal constraints, to what extent should SCHIP funds be available for  adult coverage? How has states\u2019 use of available flexibility to establish  expanded financial eligibility categories and covered populations affected  their ability to operate their SCHIP programs within the original  allotments provided to them?", "Considering the federal financing strategy, including the financial  sustainability of public commitments. As SCHIP programs have  matured, states\u2019 spending experience can help inform future federal  financing decisions. CRS testified in July 2006 that 40 states were now  spending more annually than they received in their annual original SCHIP  allotments. While many of them did not face shortfalls in 2006 because of  available prior-year balances, redistributed funds, and the supplemental  DRA appropriation, 14 states are currently projected to face shortfalls in  2007. With the pool of funds available for redistribution virtually  exhausted, the continued potential for funding shortfalls for many states  raises some fundamental questions about SCHIP financing. If SCHIP is  indeed a capped grant program, to what extent does the federal  government have a responsibility to address shortfalls in individual states,  especially those that have chosen to expand their programs beyond  certain parameters? In contrast, if the policy goal is to ensure that states  do not exhaust their federal SCHIP allotments, by providing for the  continuing redistribution of funds or additional federal appropriations,  does the program begin to take on the characteristics of an entitlement  similar to Medicaid? What overall implications does this have for the  federal budget?", "Assessing issues associated with equity. The 10 years of SCHIP  experience that states now have could help inform any policy decisions  with respect to equity as part of the SCHIP reauthorization process.  Although SCHIP generally targets children in families with incomes at or  below 200 percent of FPL, 9 states are relatively more restrictive with their  eligibility levels, while 14 states are more expansive, ranging as high as   350 percent of FPL. Given the policy goal of reducing the rate of uninsured  among the nation\u2019s children, to what extent should SCHIP funds be  targeted to those states that have not yet achieved certain minimum  coverage levels? Given current and future federal fiscal constraints, to  what extent should the federal government provide federal financial  participation above certain thresholds? What broader implications might  this have for flexibility, choice, and equity across state programs?  Another consideration is whether the formulas used in SCHIP\u2014both the  formula to determine the federal matching rate and the formula to allocate  funds to states\u2014could be refined to better target funding to certain states  for the benefit of covering uninsured children. Because the SCHIP formula  is based on the Medicaid formula for federal matching funds, it has some  inherent shortcomings that are likely beyond the scope of consideration  for SCHIP reauthorization.", "For the allocation formula that determines the amount of funds a state will  receive each year, several analysts, including CRS, have noted alternatives  that could be considered. These include altering the methods for  estimating the number of children at the state level, adjusting the extent to  which the SCHIP formula for allocating funds to states includes the  number of uninsured versus low-income children, and incorporating  states\u2019 actual spending experiences to date into the formula. Considering  the effects of any one or combination of these\u2014or other\u2014policy options  would likely entail iterative analysis and thoughtful consideration of  relevant trade-offs.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared remarks.
