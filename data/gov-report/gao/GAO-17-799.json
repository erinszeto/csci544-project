During 2012 and 2013, the TRIO components\u2014U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO)\u2014each completed an alternatives analysis (AA) to determine a preferred alternative for modernizing its financial management system. GAO found that DNDO's AA substantially met the four characteristics\u2014well-documented, comprehensive, unbiased, and credible\u2014that GAO previously identified for a reliable, high-quality analysis of alternatives (AOA) process. However, Coast Guard's and TSA's AAs did not fully or substantially meet three of these characteristics, and DHS guidance for conducting AAs did not substantially incorporate certain best practices, such as identifying significant risks and mitigation strategies and performing an independent review to help validate the AOA process. Based on these analyses and other factors, the TRIO components determined that migrating to a federal shared service provider (SSP) represented the best alternative, and in 2014, DHS selected the Department of the Interior's Interior Business Center (IBC) as the federal SSP for the project. However, because Coast Guard's and TSA's AAs did not fully or substantially reflect all of the characteristics noted above, they are at increased risk that the alternative selected may not achieve mission needs.", "DHS also did not fully follow best practices for managing project risks related to its use of IBC on the TRIO project. Specifically, DHS followed three of seven risk management best practices, such as determining risk sources and categories and establishing a risk management strategy. However, it did not fully follow four best practices for defining risk parameters, identifying risks, developing risk mitigation plans, and implementing these plans largely because its guidance did not sufficiently address these best practices. For example, although DHS created joint teams with IBC and provided additional resources to IBC to help address risk mitigation concerns, it did not always develop sufficiently detailed risk mitigation plans that also included contingency plans for selected critical risks. As a result, although IBC's capacity and experience for migrating large agencies the size of Coast Guard and TSA was identified as a risk in July 2014, a contingency plan working group to address this concern was not established until January 2017. By not fully following risk management best practices, DHS is at increased risk that potential problems may not be identified or properly mitigated.", "DHS, IBC, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and other federal oversight agencies identified various challenges that have impacted the TRIO project and contributed to a 2-year delay in the implementation of Coast Guard's and TSA's modernized solutions. These challenges include the lack of sufficient resources, aggressive schedule, complex requirements, increased costs, and project management and communication concerns. To help address these challenges, DHS and IBC established review teams and have taken other steps to assess potential mitigating steps. In May 2017, DHS determined that migrating the solution from IBC to a DHS data center represented the best option and initiated discovery efforts to further assess this as its path forward for the TRIO project."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS more fully follow best practices for conducting an AOA process and managing risks.

Based on its evaluation, Coast Guard determined that the two alternatives  were comparable.

Based on  this determination, OMB direction to agencies to use (with limited  exceptions) shared services, and other factors, Coast Guard decided that  migrating to an SSP was the best alternative. TSA found in its February  2013 analysis that the differences between federal and commercial SSP  alternatives were not significant and, as a result, recommended that a  competitive procurement be conducted to better evaluate each  alternative. However, DHS officials told us that TSA subsequently  determined that a competitive procurement was not warranted and chose  to migrate to a federal SSP. This determination was based on additional  OMB guidance issued in March 2013 directing agencies to consider  federal SSPs as part of their AAs and stating that commercial SSPs are  an appropriate solution and would be funded by OMB only in instances in  which the agency\u2019s business case demonstrates that a commercial SSP  can provide a better value for the federal government.

Coast Guard  reported that none of the commercial SSPs that responded could meet all  44 specific financial management system requirements and the extent to  which they could meet them varied significantly. Based on these results,  Coast Guard determined that there was a lack of maturity in the  commercial SSP market for federal financial management. According to  the report, this overall assessment was based on various considerations  of information provided by commercial SSP respondents, including  the wide variety of proposed configurations, solutions, prices, and  implementation schedules, the lack of federal experience and service  for agency-wide capabilities, and insufficient length of service to  establish positive trends in audit performance;  the lack of similar offerings that implied a lack of strong competition  between comparable products that would exert downward pressure  on cost; and  the lack of like product offerings, which increases the likelihood of  higher switching costs in the case of poor performance because of  increased difficulty in moving from one \u201cturnkey\u201d service to another.", "In July 2013, the TRIO components and DHS selected the federal SSP  alternative as their preferred choice and subsequently selected IBC as  their federal SSP.

The best  practice includes defining criteria for evaluating and quantifying risk  likelihood and severity levels and defining thresholds for each risk  category to determine whether risk is acceptable or unacceptable and  to trigger management action. DHS partially met this best practice.  DHS\u2019s risk management program defined rating scales to provide  consistent criteria for evaluating and quantifying risk likelihood and  severity levels. However, DHS\u2019s Risk Management Planning  Handbook and related template for developing risk management  plans for projects did not address the need for thresholds relevant to  each category of risk to facilitate review of performance metrics in  order to determine when risks become unacceptable or to invoke  selected risk-handling options when monitored risks exceed defined  thresholds.", "Establish a risk management strategy. A risk management strategy  addresses specific actions and the management approach used to  apply and control the risk management program, including identifying  sources of risk, the scheme used to categorize risks, and parameters  used to evaluate and control risks for effective handling. DHS met this  best practice. DHS and IBC established risk management policies and  plans for the TRIO project based on DHS acquisition guidance, which  provided a framework for a risk management program. Collectively,  these policies and plans constitute a risk management strategy. DHS  and IBC have periodically updated these documents to maintain the  scope of the risk management effort; the methods and tools to be  used for risk identification, risk analysis, risk mitigation, risk  monitoring, and communication; the prioritization of risks; and the  allocation of resources for risk mitigation.", "Identify and analyze risks. Key aspects of processes established by  DHS and the TRIO components related to the two best practices  associated with identifying and analyzing risks:  Identify risks. Risk identification should be an organized, thorough  process to seek out probable or realistic risks to achieving objectives.  This practice recognizes that risks should be identified and described  understandably before they can be analyzed and managed properly.  Using categories and parameters developed in the risk management  strategy and identified sources of risk guides the identification of risks  associated with cost, schedule, and performance. To identify risks,  best practice elements include reviewing the work breakdown  structure (WBS) and project plan to help ensure that all aspects of  the work have been considered. Best practices for documenting risks  include documenting the context, conditions, and potential  consequences of each risk and identifying the relevant stakeholders  associated with each risk.", "DHS partially met this best practice. DHS\u2019s July 2016 risk register  contained a wide range of risks associated with defined risk  categories. It also reflected DHS\u2019s review of the TRIO project\u2019s  integrated master schedule that IBC prepared based on the WBS and  work plans that IBC also developed. The risk register documented  the context, conditions, potential consequences, and relevant  stakeholders associated with each risk. However, DHS\u2019s documented  risk management processes did not identify all significant risks or  reflect its efforts to revisit risks that had previously been closed. For  example, DHS officials told us that IBC was unable to provide  sufficient, reliable cost and schedule information for project  monitoring; however, a risk reflecting these concerns was not included  on its July 2016 risk register. Further, the risk register included certain  closed risks related to the need for a governance structure and  strategy for ensuring that IBC met performance, cost, and schedule  objectives. Although DHS had ongoing concerns about its ability to  ensure that IBC met these objectives, the risk register did not reflect  efforts to revisit these risks to determine whether their status needed  revision or if other risks should be included on the risk register to  address its accountability concerns. In addition, DHS did not always  take timely action to document its consideration of risks identified by  its independent verification and validation (IV&V) contractor for  potential inclusion on its risk register. For example, the IV&V  contractor identified a risk related to inefficiencies in DHS\u2019s document  review process in June 2015 that was not included on DHS\u2019s risk  register until February 2016. DHS officials indicated that a crosswalk  between the DHS risk register and IV&V contractor risk management  observations was performed weekly; however, results of these weekly  reviews were not documented.", "Evaluate, categorize, and prioritize risks. Risk assessment uses  defined categories and parameters to determine the priority of each  risk to assist in determining when appropriate management attention  is required. Best practices for analyzing risks include categorizing  risks according to defined risk categories, evaluating identified risks  using defined risk parameters, and prioritizing risks for mitigation.  DHS\u2019s processes met this practice. For example, the documented risk  management program included application of defined risk categories  and parameters for all identified risks, providing a means for reviewing  risks and determining the likelihood and severity of risks being  realized. The TRIO project\u2019s Joint Risk Management Integrated  Project Team provided consistency to the application of parameters  by reviewing risk assessments when risks were first identified. By  determining exposure ratings for each identified risk, DHS prioritized  risks for monitoring and allocation of resources for risk mitigation.", "Mitigate risks. Key aspects of processes established by DHS and the  TRIO components related to the two best practices associated with  mitigating risks:", "Develop risk mitigation plans. Risk mitigation plans are developed in  accordance with the risk management strategy and include a  recommended course of action for each critical risk. The risk  mitigation plan for a given risk includes techniques and methods used  to avoid, reduce, and control the probability of risk occurrence; the  extent of damage incurred should the risk occur; or both. Elements of  this practice include determining the levels and thresholds that define  when a risk becomes unacceptable and triggers the execution of a  risk mitigation plan or contingency plan, identifying the person or  group responsible for addressing each risk, determining the costs and  benefits of implementing the risk mitigation plan for each risk,  developing an overall risk mitigation plan for the work to orchestrate  the implementation of individual risk mitigation plans, and developing  contingency plans for selected critical risks in the event impacts  associated with the risks are realized.", "DHS partially met this best practice. DHS\u2019s risk management program  documentation reflected the development of risk response plans for  most risks, including all those determined to be of medium and high  exposure level. DHS identified those responsible for addressing each  risk. However, DHS and IBC did not always develop sufficiently  detailed risk mitigation plans including specific risk-handling action  items, determination of the costs and benefits of implementing the risk  mitigation plan for each risk, and developing contingency plans for  selected critical risks in the event that their impacts are realized. For  example, a risk associated with IBC\u2019s capacity and experience for  migrating large agencies the size of Coast Guard and TSA was  identified in July 2014. Although DHS developed plans to help  mitigate this risk, a contingency plan was not developed prior to  realizing the adverse impact of not implementing Coast Guard and  TSA on IBC\u2019s modernized solution. Rather, a contingency plan  working group (CPWG) to address this and other concerns was  established in January 2017, over 2 years after the risk was initially  identified. Further, thresholds were not used within the risk  management program to define when a risk becomes unacceptable,  triggering the execution of a risk mitigation plan or contingency plan.", "Implement risk mitigation plans. Risk mitigation plans are  implemented to facilitate a proactive program to regularly monitor  risks and the status and results of risk-handling actions to effectively  control and manage risks during the work effort. Best practice  elements include revisiting and reevaluating risk status at regular  intervals to support the discovery of new risks or new risk-handling  options that can require reassessment of risks and re-planning of risk  mitigation efforts. Elements also include providing a method for  tracking open risk-handling action items to closure, establishing a  schedule or period of performance for each risk-handling activity,  invoking selected risk-handling options when monitored risks exceed  defined thresholds, and providing a continued commitment of  resources for each risk mitigation plan.", "DHS partially met this best practice. Risk monitoring of the TRIO  project consisted of reviews performed by DHS and TRIO component  officials responsible for risk management and oversight functions.  These reviews considered significant risks, risks approaching  realization events, and the effect of management intervention on the  resolution of risks. These reviews also relied, in part, on data  contained in DHS\u2019s risk register, which represents the official  repository of TRIO project risks and information on the status of risks  and related risk mitigation efforts.", "However, other aspects of DHS\u2019s efforts to implement risk mitigation  plans did not fully adhere to certain elements associated with this best  practice. For example, we identified certain issues that raised  questions concerning the accuracy of data contained in the risk  register, such as (1) the lack of clear markings indicating when the  accuracy of data on each risk was last confirmed, including risk  records that had not been modified in the previous 3 months, and   (2) certain risks for which the estimated risk impact date had already  occurred but its status risk according to DHS\u2019s risk register did not  reflect that it had been realized and become an issue. In addition,  DHS officials stated that IBC did not provide sufficiently detailed,  reliable cost and schedule information that could have been used to  monitor TRIO project risks more effectively. DHS\u2019s ability to monitor  cost, schedule, and other performance metrics was also limited  because of the lack of thresholds for management involvement, as  noted above. DHS\u2019s implementation of risk monitoring plans was  further limited by other issues, including (1) a period of performance  for each risk-handling activity, which includes a start date and  anticipated completion date to control and monitor risk mitigation  efforts, was not always established and (2) an inability to fully track  open risk-handling action items to closure existed because of the lack  of sufficient detail on specific risk-handling activities in the DHS risk  register.", "According to DHS officials, DHS relied heavily on IBC to manage risks  associated with the TRIO project and, in particular, those for which IBC  was assigned as the risk owner. They also acknowledged DHS\u2019s  responsibility for overseeing IBC\u2019s TRIO project risk management efforts  and described various actions taken to address growing concerns  regarding IBC\u2019s efforts. For example, DHS created the Joint Risk  Management Integrated Project Team, in part, to provide a forum in which  IBC could obtain assistance in developing risk responses and discuss  DHS\u2019s risk mitigation concerns. Further, to help reduce exposure of  underlying risks, DHS offered assistance to IBC\u2019s project management  functions, such as developing the integrated master schedule and  performing quality control checks on project deliverables. Despite these  efforts, DHS officials stated that challenges associated with the IAA  structure and terms of the performance work statement with IBC on the  TRIO project limited DHS\u2019s visibility into IBC\u2019s overall cost, schedule, and  performance controls and ability to oversee IBC\u2019s risk management  efforts. For example, they stated that the performance work statement did  not specify the level of reporting to be provided by IBC on cost, schedule,  and performance in sufficient detail to effectively monitor progress on  achieving key project objectives.", "Further, the limitations to managing risks related to the best practices we  assessed as partially met were largely attributable to limitations in DHS  and TRIO project guidance and policies. For example, DHS\u2019s Risk  Management Planning Handbook and related template for developing risk  management plans for projects does not address the need to define  thresholds to facilitate review of performance metrics to determine when  risks become unacceptable. Also, TRIO project policies did not address  the need to periodically revisit consideration of risk sources other than  IMS-related milestones, specify periods of performance for specific risk- handling activities, or define an interval for updating and certifying risk  statuses. In addition, DHS guidance and TRIO project policies did not  describe the need to consider and document risks specifically related to  the lack of sufficient, reliable cost and schedule information to properly  manage and oversee the project or for timely disposition of risks that its  IV&V contractor identified. Further, TRIO project risk management  policies and management tools used to implement them address best  practice elements such as determination of the costs and benefits of  implementing risk mitigation plans, developing contingency plans, and  developing specific risk-handling action items. However, these policies do  not require, and the risk register was not designed to specifically capture,  these elements in documented risk mitigation plans. By not adopting  important elements of risk management best practices into project  guidance, DHS and the TRIO components increase the risk that potential  problems would not be identified before they occur and that activities to  mitigate adverse impacts would not be effectively planned and initiated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Factors and Challenges Impacting the TRIO Project and DHS\u2019s Path Forward", "paragraphs": ["Although DHS has taken various actions to manage the risks of using IBC  for the TRIO project, including some that were consistent with best  practices, the TRIO project has experienced challenges raising concerns  regarding the extent to which its objectives will be achieved. In connection  with these challenges, the TRIO components notified DHS during April  2016 through January 2017 that certain baseline cost and schedule  objectives had not been, or were projected to not be, achieved as  planned. According to these notifications and DHS officials we  interviewed, several key factors and challenges significantly impacted  DHS\u2019s and IBC\u2019s ability to achieve TRIO project objectives as intended. In  addition, IBC, FIT, and USSM officials identified similar issues impacting  the TRIO project. In connection with these challenges, DHS and IBC  began contingency planning efforts in January 2017 to identify and  assess viable options for improving program performance and addressing  key TRIO project priorities. Plans for DHS\u2019s path forward on the TRIO  project, as of May 2017, involve significant changes, such as transitioning  away from using IBC and a 2-year delay in completing Coast Guard and  TSA\u2019s migration to a modernized solution."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Key Factors and Challenges Impacting the TRIO Project", "paragraphs": ["We grouped the key factors and challenges impacting the TRIO project  that DHS, IBC, FIT, and USSM officials and OMB staff identified into five  broad categories: (1) project resources, (2) project schedule, (3) complex  requirements, (4) project costs, and (5) project management and  communications. The key factors and challenges related to each category  are summarized below.", "Project resources: Concerns about IBC\u2019s experience and its capacity to  handle a modernization project involving agencies the size of Coast  Guard and TSA were identified as significant risks in July 2014, resulting  from discovery phase efforts completed prior to DHS and IBC\u2019s entering  the implementation phase in August 2014. According to DHS officials,  status reports, and other documentation, key TRIO project challenges  related to resources included concerns that (1) IBC encountered federal  employee hiring challenges and was unable to ramp up and deploy the  resources necessary to meet required deliverables, and (2) IBC  experienced significant turnover of key stakeholders which adversely  impacted its ability to achieve TRIO project objectives.", "In connection with DHS\u2019s decision to use IBC for the TRIO project, DHS  officials told us that DHS relied heavily on OMB and Treasury\u2019s  designation of IBC as a federal SSP and their related assessment of  IBC\u2019s capacity and experience. DHS officials also told us that DHS relied  on FIT\u2019s federal agency migration evaluation model during discovery  phase efforts that focused on assessing the functionality of the software  rather than assessing IBC\u2019s (1) capacity, experience, and capability;   (2) ability to address more complex software configurations and interfaces  associated with large agencies; and (3) cost, schedule, and performance  metrics. DHS officials stated that issues related to IBC\u2019s capacity and  experience represented the most significant challenge impacting the  TRIO project.", "IBC officials acknowledged that IBC was unable to ramp up its resources  until after the project had begun and that the IBC project team  experienced significant turnover in key leadership and TRIO project  positions over the course of the project. IBC officials also acknowledged  that during its early efforts on the TRIO project, assigned IBC staff lacked  the experience and expertise necessary for managing large-scale  projects and, as a result, many of the risks initially identified were not  effectively addressed. FIT and USSM officials and OMB staff also  acknowledged that resource challenges significantly impacted the TRIO  project. A FIT official acknowledged that assessing software functionality,  rather than implementation, was emphasized during the discovery  process. Although DHS relied on OMB and Treasury\u2019s designation of IBC  as a federal SSP, this FIT official also told us that because agencies\u2019  specific needs can vary significantly, agencies are responsible for  conducting sufficient due diligence to assess a federal SSP\u2019s ability to  meet their requirements.", "Project schedule: DHS, IBC, FIT, and USSM officials acknowledged that  migrating the TRIO components to IBC within original time frames was a  significant challenge given the overall magnitude and complexity of the  TRIO project. According to DHS officials and TRIO project  documentation, DHS identified delays in completing various tasks and  milestones including providing design phase technical documentation and design processing proposed change requests; meeting proposed baseline schedules for implementing Coast Guard  and TSA on the modernized IBC solution; and achieving initial operating capability requirements and stabilizing the  production environment after DNDO\u2019s migration to IBC because of  various issues related to reporting, invoice payment processing,  contract management processes, and resolving help desk tickets in a  timely manner.", "DHS officials also stated that IBC did not consistently update the IMS to  ensure that it accurately reflected all required tasks, the completion  status, and the resources required to complete them. Concerns related to  meeting milestones and updating the IMS were discussed during periodic  status update meetings that included DHS, IBC, OMB, FIT, and USSM  officials. IBC and DHS officials acknowledged that processes for  communicating and resolving issues were not always efficient and  contributed to schedule delays. In addition, in November 2016, USSM  noted several concerns based on its review of a draft IMS supporting  TSA\u2019s re-planning efforts to go-live in October 2017. USSM\u2019s concerns  included an incomplete project scope and schedule and need for additional  discovery to determine cost and level of effort, an extremely aggressive schedule with very limited contingencies for  the lack of interim checkpoints or oversight on tasks exceeding 30  days,  the need for a resource-loaded IMS that incorporates an appropriate  level of detail, and  the need for an expedited program governance strategy and  escalation path that DHS and IBC leadership could use to make  program decisions within the time allotted on the schedule.", "Complex requirements: DHS, IBC, FIT, and USSM officials  acknowledged the overall complexity of the TRIO project and that the lack  of a detailed understanding of the components\u2019 requirements earlier in the  project impacted IBC\u2019s and DHS\u2019s ability to satisfy the requirements as  planned. For example, USSM and FIT officials told us that under the  shared services model, the approach for onboarding new customers  usually involves migrating to a proven configuration of a solution that is  already being used by the provider\u2019s existing customers. However, rather  than taking this approach, DHS and IBC agreed to implement a more  recent version of Oracle Federal Financial software (version 12.2) with  integrated contract life cycle and project modules. Under this approach,  IBC\u2019s plans included migrating other existing customers to this upgraded  environment. USSM officials told us that migrating TRIO components to a  new solution that required configuring new software and related  applications and developing related interfaces introduced additional  complexities that contributed to issues on the TRIO project. According to  a FIT official, the functionality of this more recent version of software is  very different than that of the version IBC\u2019s existing customers used. This  official stated that IBC did not have the needed government personnel  with knowledge and experience associated with this new software, a  condition that likely contributed to the challenges experienced on the  TRIO project. IBC officials acknowledged that IBC\u2019s lack of familiarity with  Oracle 12.2 increased the complexity of the TRIO project.", "In addition, DHS and IBC perspectives on the need for changes differed  because of the lack of clarity regarding TRIO project requirements. DHS  officials told us that many change requests on the TRIO project reflected  the need for required functionality based on previously stated  requirements. They also told us that they did not consider DNDO-related  requirements to be overly complex when compared to those associated  with IBC\u2019s similarly sized customers. However, DHS officials stated that  as of June 2017, IBC has not yet met DNDO\u2019s needs to deliver a  functioning travel system interface and other requirements. According to  IBC officials, TRIO project change requests to address components\u2019  requirements were extensive and included significant customizations to  meet unique requirements that were not aligned with the federal shared  service model. IBC officials noted additional challenges in addressing  TRIO project requirements related to DHS\u2019s efforts to address certain  organizational change management and business process reengineering  responsibilities. According to IBC officials, in some instances, the TRIO  components provided conflicting requirements related to the same  process that would have been more consistent had DHS completed more  of its business process reengineering efforts prior to providing them to  IBC.", "Project costs: According to the July 2014 discovery report, proposed  implementation costs for the TRIO project totaled $89.9 million. However,  according to DHS officials and TRIO project documentation, estimated  costs significantly increased because of schedule delays, unanticipated  complexities, and other challenges. In January 2017, DHS prepared a  summary of estimated TRIO project implementation costs associated with  its IAA with IBC. According to this summary, estimated IBC-related TRIO  project implementation costs through fiscal year 2017 increased by  approximately $42.8 million (54 percent) from the $79.2 million provided  in the original August 2014 IAA with IBC as a result of modifications  required, in part, to address challenges impacting the project. DHS  officials also expressed concerns regarding increases in estimated  operations and maintenance costs for the IBC solution. For example,  according to a December 2016 memorandum to DHS on action items  associated with failing to meet the baseline schedule date for initial  operational capability, DNDO stated that IBC\u2019s updated projected costs of  operations and maintenance of its system were unaffordable. In  connection with these costs, DHS officials also stated that IBC  determined that separate, rather than shared, help desk resources were  required to support the TRIO project because it was significantly different  from the solution that IBC\u2019s existing customers used. As a result, the  officials indicated that these costs were more than originally expected.  However, IBC officials told us that a portion of the increase in help desk- related costs was also due to DNDO employees not using the system  properly because they were not sufficiently trained on it before it was  implemented. In addition, challenges impacting the TRIO project have  contributed to significant changes in the path forward on the project; as a  result, the extent to which overall TRIO project modernization costs will  be impacted going forward has not yet been determined.", "Project management and communication: According to DHS officials,  various program management-related challenges impacted the TRIO  project. For example, they expressed concerns regarding the  effectiveness of IBC\u2019s project management efforts including cost,  schedule, and change management as well as IBC\u2019s allocation of  resources and slow decision-making process. They also stated that DHS  provided significant time and resources to make up for fundamental  project management activities that were under IBC\u2019s control and not  performed. In addition, DHS officials identified limitations associated with  (1) poorly defined service level agreements and program performance  metrics, (2) poor quality control plan, and (3) the lack of mechanisms for  measuring delivery and addressing concerns regarding IBC\u2019s  performance. DHS officials told us that although various mechanisms can  be used to hold commercial vendors accountable\u2014such as cure notices,  quality assurance surveillance plans, and incentives or disincentives to  monitor performance\u2014few mechanisms are available to hold federal  agency service providers accountable for performance concerns.", "DHS officials also acknowledged challenges in their project management  and communication efforts and identified lessons learned to help improve  future efforts, including the need to establish a performance-based contract to determine objective and  enforceable activity level metrics; be more prepared for organizational changes;  improve vendor, project, and schedule management efforts; better understand SSP resource plans and monitor SSP efforts to  help ensure that sufficient resources are secured timely; and  centralize program management for financial system modernization  functions, rather than continuing with the structure used on the TRIO  project\u2014for example, the TRIO project\u2019s program management  structure consisted of program management offices at the component  level performing cost, schedule, and technical monitoring activities  with DHS headquarters\u2019 involvement focused on governance and  oversight, resulting in duplicate efforts across components.", "IBC officials acknowledged challenges concerning IBC\u2019s lack of sufficient  resources and turnover, as described above. However, they told us that  DHS\u2019s approach to project management often resulted in duplicative  meetings and a lengthy decision-making process involving several  officials and multiple review and approval processes. According to USSM  officials, the TRIO project team focused an unbalanced portion of its  efforts on the delivery of technology at the expense of organizational  change management, communication management, and other project  management areas. For example, the failure to incorporate lessons  learned from DNDO\u2019s deployment adversely affected subsequent TRIO  project implementation efforts, as change management activities did not  address previously encountered risks. An OMB staff member concurred  with the lessons learned that DHS identified, including those indicating  the need for stronger project management.

According to DHS officials, IBC indicated that it was  unable to simultaneously provide DNDO production and TSA  implementation support while also addressing the complexities related to  Coast Guard. DHS officials told us that another Tiger Team established to  address Coast Guard issues failed to complete the scope of its charter,  and as a result, Coast Guard was forced to assume a minimum of a 2- year delay (rather than the 1-year delay previously determined in May  2016) and that this significantly increased program costs.

The GAO specialist also assessed the four best practices  related to cost estimating.", "We used the average scores for each best practice to determine an  overall score for four summary characteristics\u2014well-documented,  comprehensive, unbiased, and credible\u2014of a reliable, high-quality AOA  process at each TRIO component. Next, we shared our preliminary  analysis with the TRIO components and DHS, and requested their  technical comments and any additional information for our further  consideration. For those characteristics of the AA process that received a  score of partially met or below, we met with TRIO component and DHS  officials to discuss potential reasons that an AA did not always conform to  best practices. Finally, using the same methodology and scoring process  explained above, we performed a final assessment based on our  preliminary analysis and the comments and additional information  received. The best practices were not used to determine whether DHS  made the correct decision in selecting Department of the Interior\u2019s Interior  Business Center (IBC) to implement the financial management systems  modernization solution or whether the TRIO project would have arrived at  a different conclusion had it more fully conformed to these best practices.", "We also reviewed DHS guidance for conducting AOAs and AAs against  the GAO-identified 22 AOA process best practices using the same  methodology described above for reviewing the TRIO components\u2019 AAs.  In the course of applying these best practices to a TRIO component\u2019s AA  and to DHS guidance for the AA process, we assessed the  reasonableness of the information we collected. We determined that the  information from the DHS AA process was sufficiently reliable to use in  assessing the TRIO components\u2019 AAs and DHS guidance against these  22 best practices.", "To determine the key factors, metrics, and processes used by the TRIO  components in developing and evaluating DHS\u2019s alternative solutions and  final choice for financial system modernization, we reviewed each  component\u2019s AA, including a description of (1) the alternatives  considered, (2) the market research conducted, (3) the three alternatives  evaluated, (4) the selection criteria used and how the criteria were  weighted, (5) how each alternative scored against the selection criteria,  and (6) the alternative that scored the best according to the component\u2019s  evaluation.", "To determine the extent to which DHS managed the risks of using IBC  consistent with risk management best practices, we reviewed DHS\u2019s and  TRIO components\u2019 risk management guidance and other documentation  supporting their risk management efforts, including risk registers,  mitigation plans, status reports, and risk management meeting minutes.  We also met with officials to gain an understanding of the key processes  and documents used for managing and reporting on TRIO project risks.  We assessed the processes against best practices that the Software  Engineering Institute (SEI) identified. The practices we selected are  fundamental to effective risk management activities. These practices are  identified in SEI\u2019s Capability Maturity Model\u00ae Integration (CMMI\u00ae) for  Acquisition, Version 1.3.", "In particular, the key best practices for preparing for risk management are determine risk sources and categories, define risk parameters, and establish a risk management strategy.", "The key best practices for identifying and analyzing risks are evaluate, categorize, and prioritize risks.", "The key best practices for mitigating identified risks are develop risk mitigation plans and  implement risk mitigation plans.", "We applied the criteria from the CMMI risk management process area to  determine the extent to which the expected practices were implemented,  or future activities were planned for, by the program office. The rating  system we used is as follows: (1) meets, or generally satisfies all  elements of the specific practice; (2) partially meets, or generally satisfies  a portion of specific practice elements; and (3) does not meet, or does not  satisfy specific practice elements.", "In the context of the best practices methodology, we assessed the  reliability of TRIO project risk data contained in DHS\u2019s risk register. We  interviewed officials on how the risk register was developed and  maintained, including key control activities used to provide reasonable  assurance of the accuracy of the information reported in the register. We  reviewed DHS\u2019s July 2016 risk register and minutes from risk  management committee meetings (one meeting per quarter, randomly  selected). Of 120 TRIO project risks on the July 2016 risk register, we  found 13 risks with missing data. Of 47 active risks identified, 28 risk  records had not been modified in the previous 3 months and the register  did not indicate when their accuracy was last confirmed and 35 risks were  beyond their indicated impact dates but had not been marked as issues.  We concluded that the pervasiveness of these data reliability problems  decreased the usefulness of the risk register in connection with managing  TRIO project risks.", "To determine the key factors or challenges that have impacted the TRIO  project and DHS\u2019s plans for completing remaining key priorities, we met  with DHS, IBC, Office of Financial Innovation and Transformation, and  Unified Shared Services Management office officials and Office of  Management and Budget staff to obtain their perspectives. In addition, we  reviewed documentation provided by these officials, including TRIO  project status reports and memorandums, leadership briefings, and other  presentations.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2016 to September  2017 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Best Practices for the Analysis of Alternatives Process", "paragraphs": ["Many guides describe an approach to an analysis of alternatives (AOA);  however, there is no single set of practices for the AOA process that has  been broadly recognized by both the government and private sector  entities. GAO has previously identified 22 best practices for an AOA  process by (1) compiling and reviewing commonly mentioned AOA  policies and guidance used by different government and private sector  entities and (2) incorporating experts\u2019 comments on a draft set of  practices to develop a final set of practices. These practices are based  on longstanding, fundamental tenets of sound decision making and  economic analysis.", "In addition, these practices can be applied to a wide range of activities in  which an alternative must be selected from a set of possible options, as  well as to a broad range of capability areas, projects, and programs.  These practices can provide a framework to help ensure that entities  consistently and reliably select the project alternative that best meets  mission needs. The guidance below is an overview of the key principles  that lead to a successful AOA process and not as a \u201chow to\u201d guide with  detailed instructions for each best practice identified.", "The 22 best practices that GAO identified are grouped into the following  five phases:  1.  Initialize the AOA process: Includes best practices that are applied  before starting the process of identifying, analyzing, and selecting  alternatives. This includes determining the mission need and  functional requirements, developing the study time frame, creating a  study plan, and determining who conducts the analysis.  2.  Identify alternatives: Includes best practices that help ensure that  the alternatives to be analyzed are sufficient, diverse, and viable.  3.  Analyze alternatives: Includes best practices that compare the  alternatives to be analyzed. The best practices in this category help  ensure that the team conducting the analysis uses a standard,  quantitative process to assess the alternatives.  4.  Document and review the AOA process: Includes best practices  that would be applied throughout the AOA process, such as  documenting all steps taken to initialize, identify, and analyze  alternatives and to select a preferred alternative in a single document.  5.  Select a preferred alternative: Includes a best practice that is  applied by the decision maker to compare alternatives and to select a  preferred alternative.", "The five phases address different themes of analysis necessary to  complete the AOA process, and comprise the beginning of the AOA  process (defining the mission needs and functional requirements) through  the final step of the AOA process (selecting a preferred alternative).", "We also identified four characteristics that relate to a reliable, high-quality  AOA process\u2014that the AOA process is well-documented,  comprehensive, unbiased, and credible. Table 4 shows the four  characteristics and their relevant AOA best practices.", "Conforming to the 22 best practices helps ensure that the preferred  alternative selected is the one that best meets the agency\u2019s mission  needs.
