Over time, FAA has implemented efforts to address these issues, but they persist as FAA faces greater industry demand and its overall workload has increased. The 2012 FAA Modernization and Reform Act required FAA to work with industry to resolve these issues. In response, FAA chartered two committees\u2014one to address certification processes and another to address regulatory consistency\u2014which recommended improvements in 2012. In 2013, FAA published an implementation plan for addressing the certification process recommendations and promised to publish an implementation plan for addressing the regulatory consistency recommendations at a later date.", "This testimony provides information on FAA's progress in implementing the (1) certification and approval process recommendations and (2) regulatory consistency recommendations. It also discusses future challenges industry stakeholders believe FAA will face in implementing these recommendations.

Aircraft Certification is implementing and has set milestones for completing 14 initiatives, several of which were originally begun as part of earlier certification process improvement efforts. The initiatives range from developing a comprehensive road map for major change initiatives, to improving Aircraft Certification's process for prioritizing requests for certifications and approvals (project sequencing), to reorganizing the small aircraft certification regulation. According to an update prepared by FAA in May 2014, one initiative has been completed and most are on track to be completed within 3 years. However, according to this update, two initiatives will not meet planned milestones, including the one for improving FAA's program for delegating authority to organizations to carry out some certification activities. Also, a third initiative for improving consistency of regulatory interpretation was at risk of not meeting planned milestones. Two additional initiatives, while on track for meeting planned milestones in May 2014, faced challenges because of opposition by FAA's labor unions, including one for improving Aircraft Certification's project sequencing process. GAO found in October 2013 that Aircraft Certification continued to lack performance measures for many of these initiatives, a condition that persists. In 2010, GAO had previously recommended that FAA develop a continuous evaluative process with performance goals and measures. FAA agreed but has not yet fully addressed the recommendation. Aircraft Certification officials discussed plans to develop metrics in three phases, beginning in July 2014 and in the future, for measuring (1) the progress of implementing the initiatives throughout FAA, (2) the outcomes of each initiative, and (3) the return on investment for FAA and the industry resulting from implementing the initiatives as a whole.", "FAA's Flight Standards Service (Flight Standards) is responsible for addressing the regulatory consistency recommendations, and is finalizing plans to do so. FAA has not published a detailed plan with milestones and performance metrics, and officials told GAO that they intend to publish a plan by August 2014. Flight Standards officials said they were making progress in addressing the committee's top priority recommendation\u2014mapping all FAA policy and guidance to relevant federal aviation regulations and developing an electronic system that maintains this information and that is accessible by FAA and industry users. As part of this effort, officials told GAO that Flight Standards has begun eliminating obsolete guidance and linking existing policy and guidance to the regulations.", "Going forward, Aircraft Certification's and Flight Standards' efforts may face challenges that could affect successful implementation of the committees' recommendations. Many of these recommendations represent a significant shift in how FAA normally conducts business, and if the workforce is reluctant to implement such changes, FAA's planned initiatives for addressing the recommendations could be delayed. Also, the fact that FAA has not yet implemented performance measures for most of the initiatives is a concern for both GAO and the industry. As GAO concluded in October 2013, without performance measures, FAA will be unable to gather the appropriate data to evaluate the success of current and future initiatives."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to testify today on the status of the Federal  Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) efforts to improve its certification and  approval processes. As you know, FAA is responsible for aviation safety,  and part of this responsibility entails issuing certificates for new aircraft  and aircraft parts and equipment and granting approvals for such things  as changes to air operations and aircraft, based on federal aviation  regulations. FAA\u2019s current efforts to improve these processes are aimed  at (1) improving its decision-making process for issuing certificates and  approvals, (2) keeping pace with emerging technology, and (3) enabling  industry growth and innovation. Studies published since 1980, our prior  work, industry stakeholders, and experts have long raised questions  about the efficiency of FAA\u2019s certification and approval processes and  varying interpretations and applications of its regulations in making  certification and approval decisions. More recently, several aviation  industry groups have asserted that these issues persist, resulting in  delays and higher costs for their members. These delays have been  generally attributed to heavy staff workloads and a lack of staff resources  to begin new work on certifications and approvals. With greater industry  demand and the introduction of new aircraft, equipment, and technology  into the national aviation system, FAA\u2019s workload has increased and is  expected to grow further over the next decade. We previously concluded  that it will be critical for FAA to follow through with reforms to its  certification and approval processes to meet industry\u2019s future needs.", "Over time, FAA has initiated various efforts and initiatives to improve its  certification and approval processes and interpret regulations more  consistently, including efforts in response to findings and  recommendations we made in 2010. However, to bring further attention  to these issues and spur additional action, Congress included the  following requirements for FAA in the FAA Modernization and Reform Act  of 2012: (1) work with the industry to assess and recommend  improvements to the certification and approval processes (Section 312)  and (2) address the findings from our 2010 report related to FAA  interpreting regulations more consistently (Section 313). To meet these  requirements, FAA chartered two aviation rulemaking committees in April  2012\u2014the Aircraft Certification Process Review and Reform Aviation  Rulemaking Committee (Certification Process Committee) and the  Consistency of Regulatory Interpretation Aviation Rulemaking Committee  (Regulatory Consistency Committee)\u2014which made recommendations to  FAA in May 2012 and November 2012, respectively. In an October 2013  statement, we made preliminary assessments of the two committees\u2019  recommendations and FAA\u2019s responses, finding that both FAA-chartered  committees took reasonable approaches in their work and made relevant,  clear, and actionable recommendations to FAA. However, we also  discussed challenges to making further improvements to the certification  and approval processes, most notably that FAA has not developed  performance metrics for measuring the outcomes of the initiatives. In  2010, GAO made two recommendations requiring, among other things,  that FAA develop a continuous evaluative process with performance  goals and measures for assessing its actions to improve the efficiency of  its certification and approval processes, and a method to track  submission approvals. recommendations. We also conducted interviews with FAA officials and  industry stakeholders\u2014including Boeing, the largest U.S. aircraft  manufacturer\u2014and representatives from all eight trade associations that  participated in the two aviation rulemaking committees. Related GAO  products are footnoted throughout the statement. The reports and  testimonies cited in this statement contain detailed explanations of the  methods used to conduct our prior work. We provided a draft of the new  information contained in this statement to the Department of  Transportation (DOT) for technical review and addressed its views in the  body of our statement where appropriate.", "The work upon which this testimony is based was conducted in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

FAA inspectors and engineers interpret and  implement these regulations governing certificates and approvals through  FAA policies and guidance, including orders, notices, and advisory  circulars. Additionally, FAA also has the authority to use private  individuals and organizational entities, known as designees, to carry out  many certification activities on behalf of the FAA Administrator in order to  enable FAA to better concentrate its limited staff resources on safety- critical functions.", "In Aircraft Certification, approximately 880 engineers and inspectors issue  certifications and approvals to the designers and manufacturers of new  aircraft and aircraft engines, propellers, parts, and equipment, including  the avionics and other equipment required for modernizing the air traffic  control system under the Next Generation Air Transportation System  (NextGen). Since 2005, Aircraft Certification has used a project  sequencing system to nationally prioritize certification submissions on the  basis of available resources. In fiscal year 2013, Aircraft Certification  issued 3,496 design approvals, 57 production approvals, and 536  airworthiness certificates.", "In Flight Standards, approximately 4,000 inspectors issue certificates and  approvals allowing individuals and entities to operate in the national  airspace system. These include certificates to commercial air carriers,  operators of smaller commercial aircraft, repair stations, and flight training  schools and training centers. Flight Standards field office managers in  over 100 field offices initiate certification projects within their offices on a  first-come, first served basis. In fiscal year 2013, Flight Standards issued  259 air operator certificates and 159 air agency certificates.", "When FAA receives aviation industry submissions for certificates and  approvals, it must determine whether or not resources are available to  begin the project. According to FAA, the agency considers its highest  priority to be overseeing the continued operational safety of the people  and products already operating within the national airspace system. The  same staff that provide this oversight are also tasked with other oversight  activities, such as processing new certifications and approvals that FAA  considers to be lower priority. FAA wait-lists new certification and  approval projects when resources are not available to begin the work.  Flight Standards, in particular, has historically had difficulty keeping up  with its certification workload across its regions and offices, a problem  that persists. FAA has considered ways to supplement its annual budget  by expanding its sources of funding to deal with its increasing workload  and staff shortages. However, FAA has limited options as it cannot levy  fees on its customers for most of the services it provides to industry,  including aviation product certifications and approvals.", "Attempts have been made to provide FAA with additional funding from  industry stakeholders for processing certifications and approvals. In 2007,  the administration submitted a reauthorization proposal to Congress that  called for major changes to FAA\u2019s funding and budget structure. These  changes were intended to provide a more stable, reliable basis for  funding in the long term, in part by allowing FAA to impose fees on  manufacturers for the various activities and costs related to aircraft  certification and approval. Congress has previously authorized other  agencies to charge these types of \u201cuser fees\u201d for services rendered for  processing product certification and approval. For example, the Medical  Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 authorized the Food and  Drug Administration (FDA) to charge and retain a fee for providing  services related to reviewing medical device products.

In August 2012, FAA  reported its plan to Congress for addressing the Certification Process  Committee\u2019s recommendations, and, in July 2013, the agency issued an  implementation plan with 14 initiatives.

In conjunction with the plan, FAA revised the order  that outlines the new ODA procedures. However, this initiative was  purposely delayed to provide industry with additional time to adapt to  the changes in the ODA procedures. Representatives of three  industry associations we interviewed for this testimony supported the  use and expansion of ODA by FAA. In contrast, while the Professional  Aviation Safety Specialists (PASS) agrees with the concept of ODA, it  has concerns related to expanding the program because  representatives contend that oversight of the program requires  significant FAA resources. PASS also contends that due to current  staffing shortages and increased workload, FAA does not have  enough inspectors and engineers to provide the proper surveillance of  the designees who would be granted this additional delegation  authority. On May 14, 2014, the DOT OIG announced a review of  FAA\u2019s oversight of the ODA program.

In July  2013, FAA reported to Congress on its plans for addressing the  regulatory consistency recommendations, and included its preliminary  plan for determining the feasibility of implementing these  recommendations. The report also indicated that FAA would develop a  detailed implementation plan that would include an implementation  strategy, assign responsibilities to offices and staff, establish milestones,  and measure effectiveness for tracking purposes. We found in February  2014 that FAA expected to publish such a detailed implementation plan  by late June 2014, more than 6 months after its initial target date of  December 2013.

This recommendation for  creating the master source guidance system is the top priority of the  Regulatory Consistency Committee. FAA officials indicated that  establishing this system will require two main components:", "As a first step, for linking (mapping) all relevant guidance materials to  the regulations, FAA plans to determine which \"guidance\" documents  exist across regional and field offices\u2014including orders, notices, and  advisory circulars\u2014outside FAA\u2019s electronic guidance libraries, which  are being used to answer questions, interpret or analyze regulations,  and provide guidance on regulatory matters. In December 2013, Flight  Standards sent out a memorandum requesting that staff discontinue  using any guidance documents outside those found in the guidance  libraries, to be effective January 15, 2014. The memorandum also  asked for the staff to submit any unofficial guidance worth preserving  to FAA for review. Flight Standards then conducted a review to  determine which of the unofficial guidance documents submitted  should be added to the guidance libraries. Several members of the  Regulatory Consistency Committee responded in an e-mail to FAA to  express serious concerns about this approach and stated that the  committee did not envision the cancellation of any guidance before  FAA developed a methodology to include or exclude such guidance.  The committee members further noted that FAA\u2019s memorandum  provided no method to allow existing certificate holders to retain  certifications that were based on any applied guidance that had been  cancelled. Further, these members requested that FAA either  withdraw the memorandum or address the issues they raised and  extend the date for FAA staff to comply with the memorandum.  However, two other Regulatory Consistency Committee members we  interviewed considered FAA\u2019s actions to get staff to discontinue the  use of unofficial guidance in the field to be an appropriate first step.", "Second, FAA plans to develop a master source guidance system with  the capability to consolidate information from Aircraft Certification\u2019s  and Flight Standards\u2019 electronic guidance libraries as well as legal  interpretations from the Office of Chief Counsel into a master  guidance system to allow FAA and industry users access. Specifically,  the Regulatory Consistency Committee recommended that this  system be searchable so that FAA and industry users can easily  access relevant rules and find the relevant guidance for the rule. FAA  officials assessed the possibility of using the existing Aviation Safety  Information Management System, but determined that it is not  adequate because (1) users cannot search for guidance by word and  (2) it is not compatible with other FAA data systems. According to  FAA officials, with about $750,000 in approved funding for this project,  FAA\u2019s information technology division is in the process of developing  a dynamic regulatory system that should provide the needed  capabilities. Officials indicated that when users conduct a search for a  particular topic in this system, the search results should bring up  multiple entries for specific guidance. Initially, Flight Standards plans  to use an Excel spreadsheet for storing the guidance and then  transition to the new system once it is deployed. Flight Standards  hopes to test out a first version of this system within calendar year  2014. However, the officials were unsure of the total cost of  developing and deploying the system.", "Representatives from four of the committee stakeholders we interviewed  for this testimony acknowledged that creating this system is a major effort  for FAA because of the volume of FAA guidance that potentially exists  across regional and field offices, some of which may not be in Aircraft  Certification\u2019s and Flight Standards\u2019 electronic guidance libraries.  Representatives of five industry stakeholders we interviewed provided  insights on how FAA might devise a plan for creating and populating this  system. Three of these noted that FAA will need to ensure that the  various types of guidance\u2014such as orders, notices, and advisory  circulars\u2014include links to the original federal aviation regulations. One of  these stakeholders recommended that FAA develop the system to allow a  user looking at FAA guidance to also see all relevant background  information on related decisions, and the past actions related to the  guidance in question and their relation to the original regulation. Because  of the large volume of FAA guidance, some stakeholders also suggested  that FAA begin by first choosing a starting date for which any new rules or  other new guidance it issues would include links to the relevant original  regulations.

Top  leadership must set the direction, pace, and tone for the transformation.  Additionally, buy-in and acceptance among the workforce will be critical to  successful implementation of the initiatives to address the two  committees\u2019 recommendations.", "Additionally, as we described in our 2010 report, FAA prioritizes ensuring  the continued operational safety of the people and products already  operating in the national airspace system over processing new  certifications and approvals. We reported in the 2010 report that Flight  Standards staff had little or no incentive to perform certification work  under the system in which their pay grades are established and   Other than inspectors involved with overseeing air carriers,  maintained.Flight Standards inspectors are typically responsible for a variety of types  of certificate holders. Each certificate is allocated a point value based on  the complexity of the certificate or operation, and the combined point  value for each inspector\u2019s oversight responsibilities must meet or exceed  the points allocated for the inspector\u2019s grade. However, not all of the  inspectors\u2019 duties\u2014including certification work\u2014receive points in this  system, and inspectors are subject to a downgrade if entities in their  portfolio relocate or go out of business."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Commitment to Cultural Change", "paragraphs": ["FAA and industry representatives also cited FAA\u2019s organizational culture  as a primary challenge for FAA in successfully implementing these  initiatives. They noted that many of the certification process and  regulatory consistency initiatives FAA is attempting to implement  represent cultural shifts for FAA staff in how regulations, policy, and  guidance are applied, and ultimately how certification and approval  decisions are made. As we have previously found, the implementation of  recommendations that require a cultural shift for employees can be  delayed if the workforce is reluctant in accepting such change."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Communication with Stakeholders", "paragraphs": ["Further, industry representatives have identified the lack of  communication with and involvement of stakeholders as a primary  challenge for FAA in implementing the committees\u2019 recommendations,  particularly the regulatory consistency recommendations. Successful  agencies we have studied based their strategic planning, to a large  extent, on the interests and expectations of their stakeholders, and  stakeholder involvement is important to ensure agencies\u2019 efforts and  resources are targeted at the highest priorities. However,  representatives of two industry organizations we interviewed told us that  FAA did not provide the opportunity for early input and that outreach is  low regarding the certification process recommendations, and  representatives of four industry organizations indicated that FAA has not  sought their input in responding to the regulatory consistency  recommendations. They reported that FAA had neither kept in contact  with or advised them of its plans nor engaged the Regulatory Consistency  Committee participants in the drafting of the detailed implementation plan  that is expected to be published in August. As an example, as previously  discussed, when Flight Standards published a memo in December 2013  calling for the cancellation of non-official guidance, several members of  the Regulatory Consistency Committee were unaware of the change and  expressed surprise and dissatisfaction with the action and offered their  assistance. Representatives of one industry group noted that FAA sought  their input on addressing the Certification Process Committee\u2019s  recommendations for subsequent revisions of its implementation plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Setting Performance Measures", "paragraphs": ["FAA has not fully developed performance metrics to ensure that any  initiatives it implements are achieving their intended outcomes. We have  previously found that agencies that have been successful in assessing  performance use measures that demonstrate results and provide useful  information for decision making.that FAA had not completed developing performance measures for either  the certification improvement or the regulatory consistency initiatives:   Earlier in this testimony, we reported", "FAA had developed performance measures for 5 of the 14  certification process initiatives as of May 2014 and plans to further  develop measures in three phases. In addition, most of the initiatives  are scheduled to be implemented by 2017. Although we have  assessed FAA\u2019s plan for developing these metrics as reasonable, the  agency may miss an opportunity to gather early data for evaluating  the effectiveness of its actions and making any needed corrections.", "There is no detailed plan for implementing initiatives addressing the  consistency of regulatory interpretation recommendations and  measuring their outcomes. In recent meetings, FAA officials told us  they have had difficulty in determining how to measure the outcomes  of its regulatory consistency initiatives and have not been able to  determine what specific performance metrics could be used.", "Going forward, it is critically important that FAA develop outcome-based  performance measures to determine what is actually being achieved  through the current and future initiatives, thereby making it easier to  determine the overall outcomes of each of the initiatives and to hold  FAA\u2019s field and headquarters offices and employees accountable for the  results. We are not making any new recommendations because the  recommendation we made in 2010 for FAA to develop outcome-based  performance measures and a continuous evaluative process continue to  have merit related to this issue. To its credit, FAA has initiated some  efforts and sound planning for addressing the committees\u2019  recommendations. However, it will be critical for FAA to follow through  with its initiatives and plans for developing performance metrics to  achieve the intended efficiencies and consistencies. As we noted in our  October 2013 statement, however, some improvements to the  certification and approval processes, will likely take years to implement  and, therefore, will require a sustained commitment as well as  congressional oversight.", "Chairwoman Cantwell, Ranking Member Ayotte, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
