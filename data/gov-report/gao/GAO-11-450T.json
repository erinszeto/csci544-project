The JSF is critical for recapitalizing tactical air forces and will require a long-term commitment to very large annual funding outlays. The estimated total investment cost is currently about $385 billion to develop and procure 2,457 aircraft. Because of a history of relatively poor cost and schedule outcomes, defense leadership over the past year has directed a comprehensive restructuring of the JSF program that is continuing. This testimony draws substantially from our extensive body of work on the JSF, including the current annual review mandated in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-84 244 (2009). Our draft report is being reviewed by the Department and we expect to issue it early next month.

Restructuring has consequences--higher up-front development costs, fewer aircraft bought in the near term, training delays, and extended times for testing and delivering capabilities to warfighters. Total development funding is now estimated at $56.4 billion to complete in 2018, a 26 percent cost increase and a 5-year schedule slip from the current baseline. DOD also reduced procurement quantities by 246 aircraft through 2016, but has not calculated the net effects of restructuring on total procurement costs nor approved a new baseline. Affordability for the U.S. and partners is challenged by a near doubling in average unit prices since program start and higher estimated life-cycle costs. Going forward, the JSF requires unprecedented funding levels in a period of more austere defense budgets. The program had mixed success in 2010, achieving 6 of 12 major goals and progressing in varying degrees on the rest. Successes included the first flight of the carrier variant, award of a fixed-price aircraft procurement contract, and an accelerated pace in development flight tests that accomplished three times as many flights in 2010 as the previous 3 years combined. However, the program did not deliver as many aircraft to test and training sites as planned and made only a partial release of software capabilities. The short takeoff and landing (STOVL) variant had significant technical problems and deficient flight test performance. DOD directed a 2-year period to evaluate and engineer STOVL solutions. After more than 9 years in development and 4 in production, the JSF program has not fully demonstrated that the aircraft design is stable, manufacturing processes are mature, and the system is reliable. Engineering drawings are still being released to the manufacturing floor and design changes continue at higher rates than desired. More changes are expected as testing accelerates. Test and production aircraft cost more and are taking longer to deliver than expected. Manufacturers are improving operations and implemented 8 of 20 recommendations from an expert panel, but have not yet demonstrated a capacity to efficiently produce at higher production rates. Substantial improvements in factory throughput and the global supply chain are needed. Development testing is still early in demonstrating that aircraft will work as intended and meet warfighter requirements. About 4 percent of JSF capabilities have been completely verified by flight tests, lab results, or both. Only 3 of the extensive network of 32 ground test labs and simulation models are fully accredited to ensure the fidelity of results. Software development--essential for achieving about 80 percent of the JSF functionality--is significantly behind schedule as it enters its most challenging phase."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Chairman Bartlett, Ranking Member Reyes, and members of the Tactical  Air and Land Forces Subcommittee:  Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our work on the F-35 Lightning  II, also known as the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). The JSF is the Department  of Defense\u2019s (DOD) most costly and ambitious aircraft acquisition, seeking  to simultaneously develop and field three aircraft variants for the Air  Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and eight international partners. The JSF is the  core of DOD\u2019s long-term tactical aircraft recapitalization plans as it is  intended to replace hundreds of legacy aircraft. Total planned U.S.  investment in JSF is now about $385 billion to develop and acquire 2,457  aircraft through 2035. With such a substantial funding commitment  amidst  pressing warfighter requirements for this next generation capability, DOD  has lately recognized numerous technical, financial, and management  shortcomings and continues to significantly restructure the program,  adding more time and money and making other changes that we support.", "GAO has reported on the JSF acquisition program for a number of years.  Our March 2010 report discussed additional cost and schedule pressures,  unsatisfactory performance in manufacturing and delivering aircraft, and  concerns about not meeting warfighter requirements on time and in  quantity. We concluded that DOD\u2019s plans to restructure the JSF program,  just announced before our report was issued, were well-founded, if  overdue. Also in March 2010, the Department declared that the program  experienced a breach of the critical cost growth statutory threshold and  subsequently certified to Congress in June 2010 that the JSF program  should continue. Appendix I summarizes the evolution of JSF cost and  schedule estimates at key junctures in its acquisition history through the  Nunn-McCurdy certification. Since then, in January 2011, the Secretary of  Defense announced additional development cost increases and further  changes consequent to the ongoing restructure, but has not yet established  a new approved acquisition program baseline.", "My comments today are focused largely on our latest review. Our draft  report is with DOD for comment and we expect to issue it early next  month. This will be the second annual JSF report under our current  mandate in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010.  For our latest report, we (1) evaluated program cost and schedule changes  and their implications on affordability; (2) identified progress made in  2010 against established goals; (3) assessed elements of design stability  and manufacturing maturity and reviewed production results; and (4)  reported the status of development testing and technical challenges facing  the program. To conduct this work, we evaluated DOD\u2019s restructuring  actions and impacts on the program, tracked cost and schedule changes,  and determined factors driving the changes. We reviewed program status  reports, manufacturing data, test plans, and internal DOD analyses. We  discussed results to date and future plans to complete JSF development  and move further into procurement with officials from DOD, the JSF  program office, contractor officials, and members of the independent  review teams. We toured aircraft and engine manufacturing plants,  obtained production and supply performance indicators, and discussed  improvements underway with contractors. We conducted this  performance audit from May 2010 to March 2011 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "JSF Restructuring Improves Program, but Affordability Is Challenged by Rising Costs and Delays", "paragraphs": ["Over the past year, DOD has substantially restructured the JSF program,  taking positive actions that should lead to more achievable and  predictable outcomes. Restructuring has consequences\u2014higher  development costs, fewer aircraft in the near term, training delays, and  extended times for testing and delivering capabilities to warfighters. Key  restructuring changes include the following:    The total system development cost estimate rose to $56.4 billion and  its schedule was extended to 2018. This represents a 26 percent  increase in cost and a 5-year slip in schedule compared to the current  approved program baseline established in 2007.", "Resources and time were added to development testing. Testing plans  were made more robust by adding another development test aircraft  and the use of several production aircraft; increasing the number of  test flights by one-third; extending development testing to 2016; and  reducing its overlap with initial operational testing.", "Near-term procurement quantities were reduced by 246 aircraft  through 2016; the annual rate of increase in production was lowered;  and the full-rate production decision moved to 2018, a 5-year slip from  the current baseline.", "The military services were directed to reexamine their initial  operational capability (IOC) requirements, the critical need dates when  the warfighter must have in place the first increment of operational  forces available for combat.

The net effect was  increased development funding and decreased procurement funding in the  near term. For example, compared to last year\u2019s estimate for the same  year, DOD for fiscal year 2012 requested an increase of $520 million for  JSF development and a decrease of $2.6 billion for procurement, reflecting  the reduction of 13 aircraft and associated spares. Table 1 summarizes the  revised procurement funding requirements and annual quantities during  this 5-year period following the Secretary\u2019s reductions. Even after  decreasing annual quantities and lowering the production rate of increase,  JSF procurement still escalates significantly. Annual procurement funding  levels more than double and quantities more than triple during this period.  These numbers do not include the additional orders expected from the  international partners.", "DOD does not yet know the full impact from restructuring actions on  future procurement funding requirements beyond this 5-year period. Cost  analysts are still calculating the net effects from deferring the near-term  procurement of 246 aircraft to future years and from lowering the annual  rate of increased procurement. After a Nunn-McCurdy breach of the  critical cost growth threshold and DOD certification, the most recent  milestone must be rescinded, the program restructured to address the  cause of the breach, and a new acquisition program baseline must be  approved that reflects the certification approved by the milestone decision  authority. The Secretary has not yet granted new milestone B approval for  the JSF nor approved a new acquisition program baseline. Future funding  requirements could be higher than projected and the quantities, which are  considered affordable by the U.S. and allies, could be reduced, further  driving up unit costs.", "Affordability\u2014in terms of the investment costs to acquire the JSF, the  continuing costs to operate and maintain it over the life-cycle, and its  impact on other defense programs\u2014is a challenging issue. Including the  funding added by the restructuring actions, system development cost  estimates have increased 64 percent since program start. (App. II  summarizes the increases in target prices on development contracts, and  major cost drivers contributing to increased system development funding  requirements.) Also, the estimated average unit procurement price for the  JSF has about doubled since program start and current forecasts indicate  that life-cycle costs will be substantially higher than the legacy aircraft it  replaces. Rising JSF costs erode buying power and may make it difficult  for the U.S. and its allies to buy and sustain as many aircraft as planned.", "Going forward, the JSF will require unprecedented demands for funding in  a period of more austere defense budgets where it will have to annually  compete with other defense and nondefense priorities for the  discretionary federal dollar. Figure 1 illustrates the substantive annual  development and procurement funding requirements\u2014almost $11 billion  on average through program completion in 2035. This reflects the  program\u2019s estimate at the time of the fiscal year 2011 budget submission.  These funding levels do not include additional funding increases pursuant  to the June 2010 Nunn-McCurdy certification nor funding changes in the  fiscal year 2012 budget request.

The Air Force conventional takeoff and landing variant  significantly exceeded the annual plan while initial limited testing of the  Navy\u2019s carrier variant was judged satisfactory, below plans for the number  and hours of flight but ahead on flight test points flown. The Marine  Corps STOVL, however, substantially underperformed in flight tests,  experienced significant down times for maintenance, and was challenged  by several technical issues unique to this variant that could add to its  weight and cost.
