GAO's work for the report is focused on 16 states and certain localities in those jurisdictions as well as the District of Columbia--representing about 65 percent of the U.S. population and two-thirds of the intergovernmental federal assistance available. GAO collected documents and interviewed state and local officials. GAO analyzed federal agency guidance and spoke with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) officials and with program officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the Departments of Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, Labor, and Transportation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Across the United States, as of June 19, 2009, Treasury had outlayed about $29 billion of the estimated $49 billion in Recovery Act funds projected for use in states and localities in fiscal year 2009. More than 90 percent of the $29 billion in federal outlays has been provided through the increased Medicaid Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) and the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF) administered by the Department of Education. GAO's work focused on nine federal programs that are estimated to account for approximately 87 percent of federal Recovery Act outlays in fiscal year 2009 for programs administered by states and localities. Increased Medicaid FMAP Funding All 16 states and the District have drawn down increased Medicaid FMAP grant awards of just over $15 billion for October 1, 2008, through June 29, 2009, which amounted to almost 86 percent of funds available. Medicaid enrollment increased for most of the selected states and the District, and several states noted that the increased FMAP funds were critical in their efforts to maintain coverage at current levels. States and the District reported they are planning to use the increased federal funds to cover their increased Medicaid caseload and to maintain current benefits and eligibility levels. Due to the increased federal share of Medicaid funding, most state officials also said they would use freed-up state funds to help cope with fiscal stresses. Highway Infrastructure Investment As of June 25, DOT had obligated about $9.2 billion for almost 2,600 highway infrastructure and other eligible projects in the 16 states and the District and had reimbursed about $96.4 million. Across the nation, almost half of the obligations have been for pavement improvement projects because they did not require extensive environmental clearances, were quick to design, obligate and bid on, could employ people quickly, and could be completed within 3 years. State Fiscal Stabilization Fund As of June 30, 2009, of the 16 states and the District, only Texas had not submitted an SFSF application. Pennsylvania recently submitted an application but had not yet received funding. The remaining 14 states and the District had been awarded a total of about $17 billion in initial funding from Education--of which about $4.3 billion has been drawn down. School districts said that they would use SFSF funds to maintain current levels of education funding, particularly for retaining staff and current education programs. They also said that SFSF funds would help offset state budget cuts. Accountability States have implemented various internal control programs; however, federal Single Audit guidance and reporting does not fully address Recovery Act risk. The Single Audit reporting deadline is too late to provide audit results in time for the audited entity to take action on deficiencies noted in Recovery Act programs. Moreover, current guidance does not achieve the level of accountability needed to effectively respond to Recovery Act risks. Finally, state auditors need additional flexibility and funding to undertake the added Single Audit responsibilities under the Recovery Act. Impact Direct recipients of Recovery Act funds, including states and localities, are expected to report quarterly on a number of measures, including the use of funds and estimates of the number of jobs created and the number of jobs retained. The first of these reports is due in October 2009. OMB--in consultation with a broad range of stakeholders--issued additional implementing guidance for recipient reporting on June 22, 2009, that clarifies some requirements and establishes a central reporting framework."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our work examining the uses and  planning by selected states and localities for funds made available by the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). As  federal funds provided by the Recovery Act flow into the U.S. economy,  state fiscal conditions continue to be stressed. Actual declines in sales,  personal income, and corporate income tax revenues influenced state  actions to begin to fill an estimated $230 billion in budget gaps for fiscal  years 2009 through 2011. The national unemployment rate also increased  to 9.5 percent in June 2009, and high unemployment can place greater  stress on state budgets as demand for services, such as Medicaid,  increases. Some economists have pointed to signs of economic  improvement, although associations representing state officials have also  reported that state fiscal conditions historically lag behind any national  economic recovery.", "The Recovery Act specifies several roles for GAO, including conducting  bimonthly reviews of selected states\u2019 and localities\u2019 use of funds made  available under the act.

Our bimonthly reviews examine how Recovery Act  funds are being used and whether they are achieving the stated purposes  of the act. These purposes include  to preserve and create jobs and promote economic recovery;  to assist those most impacted by the recession;  to provide investments needed to increase economic efficiency by  spurring technological advances in science and health;  to invest in transportation, environmental protection, and other  infrastructure that will provide long-term economic benefits; and  to stabilize state and local government budgets, in order to minimize  and avoid reductions in essential services and counterproductive state  and local tax increases.", "The states selected for our bimonthly reviews contain about 65 percent of  the U.S. population and are estimated to receive collectively about two- thirds of the intergovernmental federal assistance funds available through  the Recovery Act.

However, our analysis of the  latest information available on actual federal outlays reported on  www.recovery.gov indicates that in the 4 months since enactment, the  federal Treasury has paid out approximately $29 billion to states and  localities, which is about 60 percent of payments estimated for fiscal year  2009. Although this pattern may not continue for the remaining 3-1/2  months, at present spending is slightly ahead of estimates. More than 90  percent of the $29 billion in federal outlays has been provided through the  increased Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) grant awards  and the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund administered by the Department of  Education. Figure 1 shows the original estimate of federal outlays to states  and localities under the Recovery Act compared with actual federal  outlays as reported by federal agencies on www.recovery.gov.

When compared with the first two quarters of  fiscal year 2009, the FMAP in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 is  estimated to have increased in 12 of the 16 states and the District.", "From October 2007 to May 2009, overall Medicaid enrollment in the 16  states and the District increased by 7 percent. In addition, each of the  states and the District experienced an enrollment increase during this  period, with the highest number of programs experiencing an increase of 5  percent to 10 percent. However, the percentage increase in enrollment  varied widely ranging from just under 3 percent in California to nearly 20  percent in Colorado.", "With regard to the states\u2019 receipt of the increased FMAP, all 16 states and  the District had drawn down increased FMAP grant awards totaling just  over $15.0 billion for the period of October 1, 2008 through June 29, 2009,  which amounted to 86 percent of funds available. In addition, except for  the initial weeks that increased FMAP funds were available, the weekly  rate at which the sample states and the District have drawn down these  funds has remained relatively constant.", "States reported that they are using or are planning to use the funds that  have become freed up as a result of increased FMAP for a variety of  purposes. Most commonly, states reported that they are using or planning  to use freed-up funds to cover their increased Medicaid caseload, to  maintain current benefits and eligibility levels, and to help finance their  respective state budgets. Several states noted that given the poor  economic climate in their respective states, these funds were critical in  their efforts to maintain Medicaid coverage at current levels.", "Medicaid officials from many states and the District raised concerns about  their ability to meet the Recovery Act requirements and, thus, maintain  eligibility for the increased FMAP. While officials from several states  spoke positively about CMS\u2019s guidance related to FMAP requirements, at  least nine states and the District reported they wanted CMS to provide  additional guidance regarding (1) how they report daily compliance with  prompt pay requirements, (2) how they report monthly on increased  FMAP spending, and (3) whether certain programmatic changes would  affect their eligibility for funds. For example, Medicaid officials from  several states told us they were hesitant to implement minor  programmatic changes, such as changes to prior authorization  requirements, pregnancy verifications, or ongoing rate changes, out of  concern that doing so would jeopardize their eligibility for increased  FMAP. In addition, at least three states raised concerns that glitches  related to new or updated information systems used to generate provider  payments could affect their eligibility for these funds. Specifically,  Massachusetts Medicaid officials said they are implementing a new  provider payment system that will generate payments to some providers  on a monthly versus daily basis and would like guidance from CMS on the  availability of waivers for the prompt payment requirement. A CMS official  told us that the agency is in the process of finalizing its guidance to states  on reporting compliance with the prompt payment requirement of the  Recovery Act, but did not know when this guidance would be publicly  available.

Specifically, $7.8 billion of the $ 15.9 billion  obligated nationwide as of June 25, 2009 is being used for projects such as  reconstructing or rehabilitating deteriorated roads, including $3.6 billion  for road resurfacing projects. Many state officials told us they selected a  large percentage of resurfacing and other pavement improvement projects  because they did not require extensive environmental clearances, were  quick to design, could be quickly obligated and bid, could employ people  quickly, and could be completed within 3 years. In addition, $2.7 billion, or  about 17 percent of Recovery Act funds nationally, has been obligated for  pavement-widening projects and around 10 percent has been obligated for  the replacement, improvement or rehabilitation of bridges.", "As of June 25, 2009, $233 million had been reimbursed nationwide by the  Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and $96.4 million had been  reimbursed in the 16 states and the District.

Once contractors mobilize and begin work, states  make payments to these contractors for completed work, and may request  reimbursement from FHWA. FHWA told us that once funds are obligated  for a project, it may take 2 or more months for a state to bid and award the  work to a contractor and have work begin.", "According to state officials, because an increasing number of contractors  are looking for work, bids for Recovery Act contracts have come in under  estimates.

States are required to do the following:    Ensure that 50 percent of apportioned Recovery Act funds are  obligated within 120 days of apportionment (before June 30, 2009) and  that the remaining apportioned funds are obligated within 1 year. The  50 percent rule applies only to funds apportioned to the state and not  to the 30 percent of funds required by the Recovery Act to be  suballocated, primarily based on population, for metropolitan,  regional, and local use.

The percentage of funds obligated nationwide and in each of  the states included in our review is shown in figure 3.", "The second Recovery Act requirement is to give priority to projects that  can be completed within 3 years and to projects located in economically  distressed areas. Officials from most states reported they expect all or  most projects funded with Recovery Act funds to be completed within 3  years. We found that due to the need to select projects and obligate funds  quickly, many states first selected projects based on other factors and only  later identified to what extent these projects fulfilled the requirement to  give priority to projects in economically distressed areas. According to the  American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, in  December 2008, states had already identified more than 5,000 \u201cready-to- go\u201d projects as possible selections for federal stimulus funding, 2 months  prior to enactment of the Recovery Act. Officials from several states also  told us they had selected projects prior to the enactment of the Recovery  Act and that they only gave consideration to economically distressed areas  after they received guidance from DOT.", "States also based project selection on other priorities. State officials we  met with said they considered factors based on their own state priorities,  such as geographic distribution and a project\u2019s potential for job creation or  other economic benefits. The use of state planning criteria or funding  formulas to distribute federal and state highway funds was one factor that  we found affected states\u2019 implementation of the Recovery Act\u2019s  prioritization requirements. According to officials in North Carolina, for  instance, the state used its statutory Equity Allocation Formula to  determine how highway infrastructure investment funds would be  distributed. Similarly, in Texas, state officials said they first selected  highway preservation projects by allocating a specific amount of funding  to each of the state\u2019s 25 districts, where projects were identified that  addressed the most pressing needs. Officials then gave priority for funding  to those projects that were in economically distressed areas.", "We also found some instances of states developing their own eligibility  requirements using data or criteria not specified in the Public Works and  Economic Development Act, as amended. According to the act, the  Secretary of Commerce, not individual states, has the authority to  determine the eligibility of an area that does not meet the first two criteria  of the act. In each of these cases, FHWA approved the use of the states\u2019  alternative criteria, but it is not clear on what authority FHWA approved  these criteria. For example:    Arizona based the identification of economically distressed areas on  home foreclosure rates and disadvantaged business enterprises\u2014data  not specified in the Public Works Act. Arizona officials said they used  alternative criteria because the initial determination of economic  distress based on the act\u2019s criteria excluded three of Arizona\u2019s largest  and most populous counties, which also contain substantial areas that,  according to state officials, are clearly economically distressed and  include all or substantial portions of major Indian reservations and  many towns and cities hit especially hard by the economic downturn.", "Illinois based its classification on increases in the number of  unemployed persons and the unemployment rate, whereas the act  bases this determination on how a county\u2019s unemployment rate  compares with the national average unemployment rate. According to  FHWA, Illinois opted to explore other means of measuring recent  economic distress because the initial determination of economic  distress based on the act\u2019s criteria did not appear to accurately reflect  the recent economic downturn in the state. Illinois\u2019s use of alternative  criteria resulted in 21 counties being identified as economically  distressed that would not have been so classified following the act\u2019s  criteria.", "In commenting on a draft of our report, DOT agreed that states must give  priority to projects located in economically distressed areas, but said that  states must balance all the Recovery Act project selection criteria when  selecting projects including giving preference to activities that can be  started and completed expeditiously, using funds in a manner that  maximizes job creation and economic benefit, and other factors. While we  agree with DOT that there is no absolute primacy of economically  distressed area projects in the sense that they must always be started first,  the specific directives in the act that apply to highway infrastructure are  that priority is to be given to projects that can be completed in 3 years, and  are located in economically distressed areas. DOT also stated that the  basic approach used by selected states to apply alternative criteria is  consistent with the Public Works and Economic Development Act and its  implementing regulations on economically distressed areas because it  makes use of flexibilities provided by the Act to more accurately reflect  changing economic conditions. However the result of DOT\u2019s interpretation  would be to allow states to prioritize projects based on criteria that are not  mentioned in the highway infrastructure investment portion of the  Recovery or the Public Works Acts without the involvement of the  Secretary or Department of Commerce. We plan to continue to monitor  states\u2019 implementation of the economically distressed area requirements  and interagency coordination at the federal level in future reports.", "Finally, the states are required to certify that they will maintain the level of  state effort for programs covered by the Recovery Act. With one  exception, the states have completed these certifications, but they face  challenges. Maintaining a state\u2019s level of effort can be particularly  important in the highway program. We have found that the preponderance  of evidence suggests that increasing federal highway funds influences  states and localities to substitute federal funds for funds they otherwise  would have spent on highways. As we previously reported, substitution  makes it difficult to target an economic stimulus package so that it results  in a dollar-for-dollar increase in infrastructure investment.", "Most states revised the initial certifications they submitted to DOT. As we  reported in April, many states submitted explanatory certifications\u2014such  as stating that the certification was based on the \u201cbest information  available at the time\u201d\u2014or conditional certifications, meaning that the  certification was subject to conditions or assumptions, future legislative  action, future revenues, or other conditions. On April 22, 2009, the  Secretary of Transportation sent a letter to each of the nation\u2019s governors  and provided additional guidance, including that conditional and  explanatory certifications were not permitted, and gave states the option  of amending their certifications by May 22. Each of the 16 states and  District selected for our review resubmitted their certifications. According  to DOT officials, the department has concluded that the form of each  certification is consistent with the additional guidance, with the exception  of Texas. Texas submitted an amended certification on May 27, 2009,  which contained qualifying language explaining that the Governor could  not certify any expenditure of funds until the legislature passed an  appropriation act. According to DOT officials, as of June 25, 2009, the  status of Texas\u2019 revised certification remains unresolved. Texas officials  told us the state plans to submit a revised certification letter, removing the  qualifying language. For the remaining states, while DOT has concluded  that the form of the revised certifications is consistent with the additional  guidance, it is currently evaluating whether the states\u2019 method of  calculating the amounts they planned to expend for the covered programs  is in compliance with DOT guidance.", "States face drastic fiscal challenges, and most states are estimating that  their fiscal year 2009 and 2010 revenue collections will be well below  estimates. In the face of these challenges, some states told us that meeting  the maintenance-of-effort requirements over time poses significant  challenges. For example, federal and state transportation officials in  Illinois told us that to meet its maintenance-of-effort requirements in the  face of lower-than-expected fuel tax receipts, the state would have to use  general fund or other revenues to cover any shortfall in the level of effort  stated in its certification. Mississippi transportation officials are  concerned about the possibility of statewide, across-the-board spending  cuts in 2010. According to the Mississippi transportation department\u2019s  budget director, the agency will try to absorb any budget reductions in  2010 by reducing administrative expenses to maintain the state\u2019s level of  effort."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most States We Visited Have Received State Fiscal Stabilization Funds and Have Planned to Allocate Most Education Stabilization Funds to LEAs", "paragraphs": ["The Recovery Act created a State Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF) in part  to help state and local governments stabilize their budgets by minimizing  budgetary cuts in education and other essential government services, such  as public safety. Beginning in March 2009, the Department of Education  issued a series of fact sheets, letters, and other guidance to states on the  SFSF. Specifically, a March fact sheet, the Secretary\u2019s April letter to  Governors, and program guidance issued in April and May mention that  the purposes of the SFSF include helping stabilize state and local budgets,  avoiding reductions in education and other essential services, and  ensuring LEAs and public IHEs have resources to \u201cavert cuts and retain  teachers and professors.\u201d The documents also link educational progress to  economic recovery and growth and identify four principles to guide the  distribution and use of Recovery Act funds: (1) spend funds quickly to  retain and create jobs; (2) improve student achievement through school  improvement and reform; (3) ensure transparency, public reporting, and  accountability; and (4) invest one-time Recovery Act funds thoughtfully to  avoid unsustainable continuing commitments after the funding expires,  known as the \u201cfunding cliff.\u201d", "After meeting assurances to maintain state support for education at least  at fiscal year 2006 levels, states are required to use the education  stabilization fund to restore state support to the greater of fiscal year 2008  or 2009 levels for elementary and secondary education, public IHEs, and, if  applicable, early childhood education programs. States must distribute  these funds to school districts using the primary state education formula  but maintain discretion in how funds are allocated to public IHEs. If, after  restoring state support for education, additional funds remain, the state  must allocate those funds to school districts according to the Elementary  and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), Title I, Part A funding  formula. On the other hand, if a state\u2019s education stabilization fund  allocation is insufficient to restore state support for education, then a state  must allocate funds in proportion to the relative shortfall in state support  to public school districts and public IHEs. Education stabilization funds  must be allocated to school districts and public IHEs and cannot be  retained at the state level.", "Once education stabilization funds are awarded to school districts and  public IHEs, they have considerable flexibility over how they use those  funds. School districts are allowed to use education stabilization funds for  any allowable purpose under ESEA, the Individuals with Disabilities  Education Act (IDEA), the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act, or the  Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 (Perkins Act),  subject to some prohibitions on using funds for, among other things,  sports facilities and vehicles. In particular, Education\u2019s guidance states  that because allowable uses under the Impact Aid provisions of ESEA are  broad, school districts have discretion to use education stabilization funds  for a broad range of things, such as salaries of teachers, administrators,  and support staff, and purchases of textbooks, computers, and other  equipment. The Recovery Act allows public IHEs to use education  stabilization funds in such a way as to mitigate the need to raise tuition  and fees, as well as for the modernization, renovation, and repair of  facilities, subject to certain limitations. However, the Recovery Act  prohibits public IHEs from using education stabilization funds for such  things as increasing endowments; modernizing, renovating, or repairing  sports facilities; or maintaining equipment. Education\u2019s SFSF guidance  expressly prohibits states from placing restrictions on LEAs\u2019 use of  education stabilization funds, beyond those in the law, but allows states  some discretion in placing limits on how IHEs may use these funds.", "The SFSF provides states and school districts with additional flexibility,  subject to certain conditions, to help them address fiscal challenges. For  example, the Secretary of Education is granted authority to permit waivers  of state maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirements if a state certified that  state education spending will not decrease as a percentage of total state  revenues. Education issued guidance on the MOE requirement, including  the waiver provision, on May 1, 2009. Also, the Secretary may permit a  state or school district to treat education stabilization funds as nonfederal  funds for the purpose of meeting MOE requirements for any program  administered by Education, subject to certain conditions.

The Recovery Act provides that these  funds must be used for public safety and other government services and  that these services may include assistance for education, as well as  modernization, renovation, and repairs of public schools or IHEs.", "On April 1, 2009, Education made at least 67 percent of each state\u2019s SFSF  funds available, subject to the receipt of an application containing state  assurances, information on state levels of support for education and  estimates of restoration amounts, and baseline data demonstrating state  status on each of the four education reform assurances. If a state could not  certify that it would meet the MOE requirement, Education required it to  certify that it will meet requirements for receiving a waiver\u2014that is, that  education spending would not decrease relative to total state revenues. In  determining state level of support for elementary and secondary  education, Education required states to use their primary formula for  distributing funds to school districts but also allowed states some  flexibility in broadening this definition. For IHEs, states have some  discretion in how they establish the state level of support, with the  provision that they cannot include support for capital projects, research  and development, or amounts paid in tuition and fees by students. In order  to meet statutory requirements for states to establish their current status  regarding each of the four required programmatic assurances, Education  provided each state with the option of using baseline data Education had  identified or providing another source of baseline data. Some of the data  provided by Education was derived from self-reported data submitted  annually by the states to Education as part of their Consolidated State  Performance Reports (CSPR), but Education also relied on data from third  parties, including the Data Quality Campaign (DQC), the National Center  for Educational Achievement (NCEA), and Achieve.", "Education has reviewed applications as they arrive for completeness and  has awarded states their funds once it determined all assurances and  required information had been submitted. Education set the application  deadline for July 1, 2009. On June 24, 2009, Education issued guidance to  states informing them they must amend their applications if there are  changes to the reported levels of state support that were used to  determine maintenance of effort or to calculate restoration amounts.", "As of June 30, 2009, of the 16 states and the District of Columbia covered  by our review, only Texas had not submitted an SFSF application.  Pennsylvania recently submitted an application but had not yet received  funding. The remaining 14 states and the District of Columbia had  submitted applications and Education had made available to them a total  of about $17 billion in initial funding. As of June 26, 2009, only 5 of these  states had drawn down SFSF Recovery Act funds. In total, about 25  percent of available funds had been drawn down by these states.", "Three of the selected states\u2014Florida, Massachusetts, and New Jersey\u2014 said they would not meet the maintenance-of-effort requirements but  would meet the eligibility requirements for a waiver and that they would  apply for a waiver. Most of the states\u2019 applications show that they plan to  provide the majority of education stabilization funds to LEAs, with the  remainder of funds going to IHEs. Several states and the District of  Columbia estimated in their application that they would have funds  remaining beyond those that would be used to restore education spending  in fiscal years 2009 and 2010. These funds can be used to restore education  spending in fiscal year 2011, with any amount left over to be distributed to  LEAs.", "States have flexibility in how they allocate education stabilization funds  among IHEs but, once they establish their state funding formula, not in  how they allocate the funds among LEAs. Florida and Mississippi allocated  funds among their IHEs, including universities and community colleges,  using formulas based on factors such as enrollment levels. Other states  allocated SFSF funds taking into consideration the budget conditions of  the IHEs.", "Regarding LEAs, most states planned to allocate funds based on states\u2019  primary funding formulae. Many states are using a state formula based on  student enrollment weighted by characteristics of students and LEAs. For  example, Colorado\u2019s formula accounts for the number of students at risk  while the formula used by the District allocates funds to LEAs using  weights for each student based on the relative cost of educating students  with specific characteristics. For example, an official from Washington,  D.C. Public Schools said a student who is an English language learner may  cost more to educate than a similar student who is fluent in English.", "States may use the government services portion of SFSF for education but  have discretion to use the funds for a variety of purposes. Officials from  Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, and New York reported that their states plan  to use some or most of their government services funds for educational  purposes. Other states are applying the funds to public safety. For  example, according to state officials, California is using the government  services fund for it corrections system, and Georgia will use the funds for  salaries of state troopers and staff of forensic laboratories and state  prisons.", "Officials in many school districts told us that SFSF funds would help offset  state budget cuts and would be used to maintain current levels of  education funding. However, many school district officials also reported  that using SFSF funds for education reforms was challenging given the  other more pressing fiscal needs.", "Although their plans are generally not finalized, officials in many school  districts we visited reported that their districts are preparing to use SFSF  funds to prevent teacher layoffs, hire new teachers, and provide  professional development programs. Most school districts will use the  funding to help retain jobs that would have been cut without SFSF  funding. For example, Miami Dade officials estimate that the stabilization  funds will help them save nearly two thousand teaching positions. State  and school district officials in eight states we visited (California, Colorado,  Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, and North Carolina)  also reported that SFSF funding will allow their state to retain positions,  including teaching positions that would have been eliminated without the  funding. In the Richmond County School System in Georgia, officials  noted they plan to retain positions that support its schools, such as  teachers, paraprofessionals, nurses, media specialists and guidance  counselors. Local officials in Mississippi reported that budget-related  hiring freezes had hindered their ability to hire new staff, but because of  SFSF funding, they now plan to hire. In addition, local officials in a few  states told us they plan to use the funding to support teachers. For  example, officials in Waterloo Community and Ottumwa Community  School Districts in Iowa as well as officials from Miami-Dade County in  Florida cited professional development as a potential use of funding to  support teachers.", "Although school districts are preventing layoffs and continuing to provide  educational services with the SFSF funding, most did not indicate they  would use these funds to pursue educational reform. School district  officials cited a number of barriers, which include budget shortfalls, lack  of guidance from states, and insufficient planning time. In addition to  retaining and creating jobs, school districts have considerable flexibility to  use these resources over the next 2 years to advance reforms that could  have long-term impact. However, a few school district officials reported  that addressing reform efforts was not in their capacity when faced with  teacher layoffs and deep budget cuts. In Flint, Michigan, officials reported  that SFSF funds will be used to cope with budget deficits rather than to  advance programs, such as early childhood education or repairing public  school facilities. According to the Superintendent of Flint Community  Schools, the infrastructure in Flint is deteriorating, and no new school  buildings have been built in over 30 years. Flint officials said they would  like to use SFSF funds for renovating buildings and other programs, but  the SFSF funds are needed to maintain current education programs.", "Officials in many school districts we visited reported having inadequate  guidance from their state on using SFSF funding, making reform efforts  more difficult to pursue. School district officials in most states we visited  reported they lacked adequate guidance from their state to plan and report  on the use of SFSF funding. Without adequate guidance and time for  planning, school district officials told us that preparing for the funds was  difficult. At the time of our visits, several school districts were unaware of  their funding amounts, which, officials in two school districts said, created  additional challenges in planning for the 2009-2010 school year. One  charter school we visited in North Carolina reported that layoffs will be  required unless their state notifies them soon how much SFSF funding  they will receive. State officials in North Carolina, as well as in several  other states, told us they are waiting for the state legislature to pass the  state budget before finalizing SFSF funding amounts for school districts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "IHEs Plan to Use SFSF Funds for Faculty Salaries and Other Purposes and Expect the Funds to Save Jobs and Mitigate Tuition Increases", "paragraphs": ["Although many IHEs had not finalized plans for using SFSF funds, the  most common expected use for the funds at the IHEs we visited was to  pay salaries of IHE faculty and staff.

Other IHEs expected to use SFSF funds in the future to pay salaries  of certain employees during the year.", "Several IHEs we visited are considering other uses for SFSF funds.  Officials at the Borough of Manhattan Community College in New York  City want to use some of their SFSF funds to buy energy saving light bulbs  and to make improvements in the college\u2019s very limited space such as, by  creating tutoring areas and study lounges. Northwest Mississippi  Community College wants to use some of the funds to increase e-learning  capacity to serve the institution\u2019s rapidly increasing number of students.

Officials at  several IHEs noted that this will have a positive impact on the educational  environment such as, by preventing increases in class size and enabling  the institutions to offer the classes that students need to graduate. In  addition to preserving existing jobs, some IHEs anticipate creating jobs  with SFSF funds. Besides saving and creating jobs at IHEs, officials noted  that SFSF monies will have an indirect impact on jobs in the community.  IHE officials also noted that SFSF funds will indirectly improve  employment because some faculty being paid with the funds will help  unemployed workers develop new skills, including skills in fields, such as  health care, that have a high demand for trained workers.

Congress is considering a  legislative proposal in this area and could address the following issues:    To the extent that appropriate adjustments to the Single Audit process  are not accomplished under the current Single Audit structure,  Congress should consider amending the Single Audit Act or enacting  new legislation that provides for more timely internal control  reporting, as well as audit coverage for smaller Recovery Act programs  with high risk.", "To the extent that additional audit coverage is needed to achieve  accountability over Recovery Act programs, Congress should consider  mechanisms to provide additional resources to support those charged  with carrying out the Single Audit act and related audits."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Reporting on Impact", "paragraphs": ["Under the Recovery Act, responsibility for reporting on jobs created and  retained falls to nonfederal recipients of Recovery Act funds.

State  and local officials expressed concerns that this incremental approach  hinders their efforts to plan and administer Recovery Act programs. As a  result, we continue to believe OMB can strike a better balance between  developing timely and responsive guidance and providing some degree of  a longer range time line so that states and localities can better anticipate  which programs will be affected and when new guidance is likely to be  issued. OMB\u2019s consideration of a master schedule and its  acknowledgement of the extraordinary proliferation of program guidance  in response to Recovery Act requirements seem to support a more  structured approach.

While we agree with DOT that there is no absolute primacy of  economically distressed area projects in the sense that they must always  be started first, the specific directives in the act that apply to highway  infrastructure are that priority is to be given to projects that can be  completed in 3 years, and are located in economically distressed areas.  DOT also stated that the basic approach used by selected states to apply  alternative criteria is consistent with the Public Works and Economic  Development Act and its implementing regulations on economically  distressed areas because it makes use of flexibilities provided by the  Public Works Act to more accurately reflect changing economic  conditions. However the result of DOT\u2019s interpretation would be to allow  states to prioritize projects based on criteria that are not mentioned in the  highway infrastructure investment portion of the Recovery or the Public  Works Acts without the involvement of the Secretary or Department of  Commerce.
