This report examines the extent to which (1) school districts are testing for, finding, and remediating lead in drinking water; (2) states are supporting these efforts; and (3) federal agencies are supporting state and school district efforts. GAO administered a web-based survey to a stratified, random sample of 549 school districts, the results of which are generalizable to all school districts.

An estimated 41 percent of school districts, serving 12 million students, had not tested for lead. GAO's survey showed that, among school districts that did test, an estimated 37 percent found elevated lead (lead at levels above their selected threshold for taking remedial action.) (See figure.) All school districts that found elevated lead in drinking water reported taking steps to reduce or eliminate exposure to lead, including replacing water fountains, installing filters or new fixtures, or providing bottled water.", "According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), at least 8 states have requirements that schools test for lead in drinking water as of 2017, and at least 13 additional states supported school districts' voluntary efforts with funding or in-kind support for testing and remediation. In addition, the five states GAO visited provided examples of technical assistance to support testing in schools.", "EPA provides guidance and other resources to states and school districts regarding testing and remediating lead in drinking water, and the Department of Education (Education) provides some of this information on its websites. School district officials that used EPA's written guidance said they generally found it helpful. Although EPA guidance emphasizes the importance of addressing elevated lead levels, GAO found that some aspects of the guidance, such as the threshold for taking remedial action, were potentially misleading and unclear, which can put school districts at risk of making uninformed decisions. In addition, many school districts reported a lack of familiarity with EPA's guidance, and their familiarity varied by region of the country. Education and EPA do not regularly collaborate to support state and school district efforts on lead in drinking water, despite agreeing to do so in a 2005 memorandum of understanding. Such collaboration could encourage testing and ensure that more school districts will have the necessary information to limit student and staff exposure to lead."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making seven recommendations, including that EPA update its guidance on how schools should determine lead levels requiring action and for EPA and Education to collaborate to further disseminate guidance and encourage testing for lead.

Exposure to lead can result in elevated blood lead levels and  negative health effects. Children are at particular risk, because their  growing bodies absorb more lead than adults, so protecting them from  lead is important to lifelong good health. According to the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), elevated blood lead levels have  been linked to anemia, kidney and brain damage, learning disabilities,  and decreased growth. As a result of widespread human use, lead is  prevalent in the environment; for example, it can be found in paint and  soil, and can leach into drinking water from lead-containing plumbing  materials, such as faucets and drinking fountains.", "Lead in school drinking water is a concern because it is a daily source of  water for over 50 million children enrolled in public schools. The pattern of  school schedules\u2014including time off over weekends, holidays, and  extended breaks\u2014can contribute to standing water in the school\u2019s  plumbing system. If there is lead in the plumbing system, the potential for  it to leach into water can increase the longer the water remains in contact  with the plumbing. Other factors also influence the extent to which lead  enters the water, such as the chemistry of the water, the amount of lead  that comes into contact with the water, and the presence of protective  scales or coatings inside plumbing materials.", "While there is no federal law requiring testing of drinking water for lead in  schools that receive water from public water systems, these water  systems themselves are regulated by the Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA) under the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR), as required by the  Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Because the LCR regulates public  water systems, it does not directly address individual schools that are  served by a public water system. The federal government\u2014including  EPA, the Department of Education (Education), and CDC\u2014has a limited  role in addressing lead in school drinking water. These agencies, along  with other organizations, signed a memorandum of understanding in 2005  encouraging lead testing and remediation in schools, and they provide  information and guidance to stakeholders, such as state officials and  school districts. Several states and school districts have taken steps to  test for lead in school drinking water. States and school districts that  choose to test generally set their own threshold, or \u201caction level,\u201d of lead  found in drinking water that requires action, such as replacing a water  fountain or installing a filter. We use the term elevated lead in this report  to mean lead at levels above a selected action level.", "You asked us to study the testing and remediation practices used to  protect children from lead. This report builds upon a separate 2017 review  that addresses schools with their own water source that are therefore  subject to federal requirements for lead testing and remediation under the  LCR. In this review, our objectives were to examine (1) the extent to  which school districts are testing for, finding, and remediating lead in  school drinking water; (2) the extent to which states require or support  testing for and remediating lead in school drinking water by school  districts; and (3) the extent to which federal agencies are supporting state  and school district efforts to test for and remediate lead.", "To address our first objective, we drew a stratified, random sample of 549  school districts, administered a web-based survey from July to October  2017 asking whether they had tested for, found, or remediated lead in the  past 12 months, and achieved a 68 percent response rate. Based on the  design and response rate, estimates generated from these survey results  are generalizable to the population of public school districts. We also  conducted site visits to or interviewed officials with 17 school districts with  experience testing for lead in drinking water and selected to vary in  population density. These districts were located in five states\u2014Georgia,  Illinois, Massachusetts, Oregon, and Texas\u2014which were selected to vary  in geographic location and because they varied in the extent to which  they required school-based lead testing and remediation. To address our  second and third objectives, we used site visit information, requested  information about state requirements from selected state officials, and  interviewed officials in EPA\u2019s headquarters and in all 10 regional offices,  and at Education and CDC. We reviewed relevant documents, such as  the 2005 memorandum of understanding and EPA guidance, as well as  relevant federal and state laws and regulations. For the states with testing  requirements, we reviewed relevant laws, regulations and policy  documents and confirmed our understanding of state testing  requirements with state officials. We provided the information about state  requirements to appropriate state officials for their review and  confirmation. We evaluated federal efforts to support lead testing and  remediation in schools against the actions prescribed in the memorandum  and federal standards for internal control, which call for agencies to  provide effective communication to external parties, among other things.

School districts can range in size from one school  (for example, in rural areas) to hundreds of schools in large urban and  suburban areas. For example, the 100 largest districts in the United  States together have approximately 16,000 schools and enroll about 11  million students. In addition, charter schools are public schools created to  achieve a number of goals, such as encouraging innovation in public  education. Oversight of charter schools can vary, with some states  establishing charter schools as their own school district and other states  allowing charter schools to be either a distinct school district in  themselves or part of a larger district. Charter schools are often  responsible for their own facilities; these may be located in non-traditional  school buildings, and may lease part or all of their space.", "Typically, state educational agencies are responsible for administering  state and federal education laws, disbursing state and federal funds, and  providing guidance to school districts and schools across the state. State  educational agencies frequently provide funds for capital improvements to  school facilities, which school districts may use to address issues related  to lead in school drinking water, among other things.

According to the CDC, lead in  drinking water can cause health effects if it enters the bloodstream and  causes an elevated blood lead level. Lead in a child\u2019s body can slow  down growth and development, damage hearing and speech, and lead to  learning disabilities. For adults, lead can have detrimental effects on  cardiovascular, renal, and reproductive systems and can prompt memory  loss. In pregnant women, lead stored in bones (due to lead exposure prior  to and during pregnancy) can be released as maternal calcium used to  form the bones of the fetus, reduce fetal growth, and increase risk of  miscarriage and stillbirth. The presence of lead in the bloodstream can  disappear relatively quickly, but bones can retain the toxin for decades.  Lead in bones may be released into the blood, re-exposing organ  systems long after the original exposure. The concentration of lead, total  amount consumed, and duration of exposure influence the severity of  health effects. The health consequences of lead exposure can differ from  person to person and are affected by the cumulative dose of lead and the  vulnerability of the individual person regardless of whether the lead  exposure is from food, water, soil, dust, or air. Although there are medical  therapies to remove lead from the body, they cannot undo the damage it  has already caused. For these reasons, EPA, CDC, and others  recommend the prevention of lead exposure to the extent possible,  recognizing that lead is widespread in the environment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Safe Drinking Water Act", "paragraphs": ["The SDWA authorizes EPA to set standards for drinking water  contaminants in public water systems. For a given contaminant the act  requires EPA to first establish a maximum contaminant level goal, which  is the level at which no known or anticipated adverse effects on the health  of persons occur and which allows an adequate margin of safety. EPA  must then set an enforceable maximum contaminant level as close to the  maximum contaminant level goal as is feasible, or require water systems  to use a treatment technique to prevent known or anticipated adverse  effects on the health of persons to the extent feasible. Feasible means  the level is achievable using the best available technology or treatment  technique.", "In 1991 EPA issued the LCR, which it revised in 2000 and 2007,  establishing regulations for water systems covered by the SDWA. Lead  concentration in water is typically measured in micrograms of lead per  liter of water (also referred to as \u201cparts per billion\u201d or ppb). The rule  established a maximum contaminant level goal of zero, because EPA  concluded that there was no established safe level of lead exposure. EPA  decided not to establish an enforceable maximum contaminant level,  concluding that any level reasonably close to the goal would result in  widespread noncompliance, and therefore was not feasible. Instead, the  rule established an \u201caction level\u201d of 15 micrograms of lead per liter (15  ppb) in a one liter sample of tap water, a level that EPA believed was  generally representative of what could be feasibly achieved at the tap.  The action level is a screening tool for determining when certain follow-up  actions are needed, which may include corrosion control treatment, public  education, and lead service line replacement. Sample results that exceed  the lead action level do not by themselves constitute violations of the rule.  If the lead action level is exceeded in more than 10 percent of tap water  samples collected during any monitoring period (that is, if the 90th  percentile level is greater than the action level), a water system must take  actions to reduce exposure.", "Several amendments to the SDWA are relevant to testing for lead in  school drinking water. In 1988, the SDWA was amended by the Lead  Contamination Control Act (LCCA), which banned the manufacture and  sale of drinking water coolers with lead-lined tanks containing more than  8 percent lead; the statute defined a drinking water cooler as containing 8  percent lead or less as \u201clead-free.\u201d The LCCA also required states to  establish testing and remediation programs for schools. However, in  1996 a federal circuit court held that this requirement was  unconstitutional. In 2011, Congress passed the Reduction of Lead in  Drinking Water Act, which amended the SDWA by lowering the maximum  allowable lead content in \u201clead-free\u201d plumbing materials such as pipes.  This provision became effective on January 4, 2014. In 2016, Congress  passed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act which,  among other things, amended the SDWA, to establish a grant program for  states to assist school districts in voluntary testing for lead contamination  in drinking water at schools. As a condition of receiving funds, school  districts are required to test for lead using standards that are at least as  stringent as those in federal guidance for schools.

Minnesota requires  school districts to develop a plan to test by July 2018 and California  requires that water systems sample all covered public schools in their  service area by July 2019. According to state officials, schools in  Maryland must test by July 2020. In Virginia, no timeline for testing is  indicated in the requirement.", "In addition, requirements in these eight states vary in terms of covered  schools and frequency of testing. For example, in Maryland, all schools,  including charter and private schools, are required to test their water for  lead by July 2020 and must re-test every 3 years. After regulations were  approved in July 2016, New Jersey required testing within a year in all  traditional public schools, charter schools, and certain private schools,  and re-testing every 6 years, according to state officials. Illinois\u2019  requirement is for public and private elementary schools constructed  before 2000 to test their drinking water for lead, and does not mandate re- testing. Seven of the eight states include at least some charter schools in  their testing requirements (New York does not).", "State testing requirements also differ in terms of action level, sample  sizes, and number of samples, according to state documents. States can  choose their own lead threshold or action level for remediation, and the  eight states have chosen levels ranging from any detectable level in  Illinois to 20 ppb in Maryland. Six of the eight states have chosen to use  250 milliliter samples of water, while California is using a one liter sample  size, and Virginia delegates to school districts to choose their action level  and sample size. Some states specify that all drinking water sources in  a building must be tested, such as in New York and New Jersey, or allow  a smaller number of samples to be tested, such as in California, which  recommends that water systems take between one and five samples per  school. To implement its testing requirement, the District of Columbia has  installed filters in all school drinking water sources, and plans to test the  filtered water from each fixture for elevated lead annually.", "The responsibility for the costs of testing and remediation also differ by  state. According to state officials, in Minnesota, the costs of testing may  be eligible for reimbursement from the state, and in the District of  Columbia, the Department of General Services is responsible for the  cost. California requires that public water systems cover the cost of testing for all public schools in their jurisdiction. In all other states we  looked at, schools or school districts are at least partially responsible for  the costs of testing. Additionally, most schools or school districts are  responsible for the costs of remediation, although Minnesota, New York,  and the District of Columbia will provide funds to help with the costs of  remediation as well.", "Seven of the eight state requirements have a provision for communicating  the results of lead sampling and testing in schools. For example,  Minnesota requires all test results be made public and New York requires  that results be communicated to students\u2019 families. Maryland and New  Jersey require that results above the action level be reported to the  responsible state agency, such as the Department of the Environment or  the Department of Education, and that sample results that find elevated  levels of lead be communicated to students\u2019 families. Illinois requires that  all results be made available to families and that individual letters to  families also be sent if lead levels over 5 ppb are found. In contrast,  Virginia does not include a provision to communicate testing results in its  testing requirement for schools.", "According to stakeholders and state officials we interviewed, states have  several other common issues to consider in implementing a state testing  and remediation program. First, states need to ensure that their efforts,  which can be significant given the thousands of schools that operate in  each state, can be completed with limited resources and by a legislated  deadline. Second, coordination between relevant state agencies, which  will vary by state, may be challenging. Because of the nature of testing for  lead in school drinking water, multiple government agencies may be  involved, necessitating a balance of responsibilities and information- sharing between these state agencies. Finally, state officials told us that  imposing requirements without providing funding to implement them may  be a challenge for schools in complying with testing and remediation  requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional States Provided Funding and Technical Assistance to Support School District Efforts to Test for and Remediate Lead", "paragraphs": ["Apart from the states with requirements to test for lead in school drinking  water discussed in this report, at least 13 additional states had also  provided funding or in-kind support to school districts to assist with  voluntary lead testing and remediation, according to EPA regional offices.  Those states are Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Maine,  Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island,  Vermont, and Washington. In Massachusetts, for example, officials told  us the state used $2.8 million from the state Clean Water Trust to fund a  voluntary program for sampling and testing for all participating public  schools in 2016 and 2017. Massachusetts contracted with a state  university to assist schools with testing for lead in drinking water. When  the program completed its first round of testing in February 2017, 818  schools throughout the state had participated, and the state has begun a  second round of sampling with remaining funds from the Clean Water  Trust.  In Oregon, officials told us the state legislature provided funding  for matching grants of up to $8 million to larger school districts for  facilities improvements, and made $5 million of emergency funds  available to reimburse school districts for laboratory fees associated with  drinking water testing as part of the state\u2019s efforts to address student  safety.", "States can also provide technical assistance to support school districts in  their efforts to test for and remediate lead in drinking water. The five  states we visited provided a range of technical assistance to school  districts. For example, to implement the voluntary assistance program in  Massachusetts, the contracted university told us they hired 15 additional  staff and assisted schools in designing sampling plans, taking samples,  and sending them for testing. University officials told us they oversaw the  sampling of all drinking water sources in each participating school and  sent the sample to state certified laboratories for analysis. State officials  encouraged schools to shut off all fixtures in which water tested at or  above the action level of 15 ppb and provided guidance on actions to  take, such as removing and replacing fixtures, using signage to indicate  fixtures not to be used for drinking water, and implementing a flushing  program. The state developed an online reporting tool so that all test  results could be publicly posted. State officials also supported schools in  communicating lead testing results to parents and the community.", "Other states we visited provided technical assistance to school districts  through webinars, guidance documents, in-person presentations, and  responding to inquiries. In Oregon, the state Department of Education  and the state Health Authority collaborated in 2016 to provide guidance to  schools on addressing lead in drinking water. The Governor issued a  directive requesting all school districts test for lead in their buildings and  the Health Authority requested that districts send them the results. In  Texas, officials at the Commission for Environmental Quality have made  presentations to schools on water sampling protocols and provided  templates for school districts to communicate results. Officials told us that  an increased number of school districts have contacted them in the past  year seeking guidance, and, in response, they directed districts to EPA\u2019s  3Ts guidance and a list of accredited laboratories. In Illinois, state officials  partnered with the state chapter of the American Water Works  Association to provide a guidance document for drinking water sampling  and testing to assist schools in complying with new testing requirements.  In Georgia, officials at the Department of Natural Resources told us they  promote the 3Ts guidance on their website and have offered themselves  as a resource on school testing at presentations with local water  associations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "EPA Provides Several Resources on Lead, but EPA and Education Should Provide More Information to Support States and School Districts and Improve Collaboration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "EPA Provides Guidance, Training, and Technical Assistance on Lead Testing and Remediation, but States and School Districts Need Updated Guidance", "paragraphs": ["EPA provides several voluntary resources, such as guidance, training,  and technical assistance, to states and school districts regarding testing  for and remediation of lead in school drinking water, but some school  districts we surveyed and officials we interviewed said more information  would be helpful. The Lead Contamination Control Act of 1988 (LCCA)  required EPA to publish a guidance document and testing protocol to  assist schools in their testing and remediation efforts. EPA\u2019s Office of  Ground Water and Drinking Water issued its 3Ts guidance which  provides information on training school officials, testing drinking water in  schools, and telling the school and broader community about these  efforts. Of the school districts that reported in our survey using the 3Ts  guidance to inform their lead testing efforts, an estimated 68 percent  found the guidance extremely or very helpful for conducting tests. The  Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water also developed an additional  online resource\u2014known as the 3Ts guidance toolkit\u2014to further assist  states and school districts with their lead in drinking water prevention  programs by providing fact sheets and brochures for community  members, among other things. Some states have used the 3Ts  guidance as a resource for their state programs, according to EPA  officials. For example, a New York regulation directs schools to use the  3Ts guidance as a technical reference when implementing their state- required lead testing and remediation programs.", "The Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water provides training to  support states and school districts with their lead testing and remediation  programs. In June 2017, EPA started a quarterly webinar series to  highlight school district efforts to test for lead. These webinars include  presentations from school officials and key partners that conducted lead  testing and remediation. For example, on June 21, 2017, officials from  Denver Public Schools and Denver Water presented on their efforts to  test for lead in the public school system.", "EPA\u2019s approach to providing guidance and technical assistance to states  and school districts is determined by each of the 10 EPA regional offices.  Some EPA regional offices provide the 3Ts guidance to school districts  upon request and others conduct outreach to share the guidance,  typically through their healthy schools coordinator when discussing other  topics, such as indoor air quality and managing chemicals. EPA regional  offices also provide technical assistance by request, typically through  phone consultations with school districts that have questions regarding  the 3Ts guidance, according to EPA headquarters officials. Officials also  indicated that the agency has received more requests for technical  assistance from schools over the past few years regarding lead in  drinking water. Officials in EPA Regions 1 in Boston and 2 in New York  City told us they provided technical assistance to school districts by  conducting lead testing and analysis in school facilities and Region 9 in  San Francisco provided technical assistance by reviewing school district  testing protocols. For example, EPA Region 2 officials said between  2002 and 2016 they worked with one to two school districts per year to  assist with their lead testing efforts. As part of this effort, the regional  office provided funding for sampling and analysis. Officials said they  prioritized school districts based on population size and whether the  community had elevated blood lead levels. Other EPA regional office  approaches included identifying resources and guidance for relevant state  agencies and facilitating information sharing by connecting districts that  have tested for lead with districts that are interested in doing so.  However, most EPA regional offices do not provide technical assistance  in the form of testing, analysis, or remediation to school districts, and  some do little or no outreach to communicate the importance of testing for  and remediating lead in school drinking water. According to federal  standards for internal control, management should externally  communicate the necessary quality information to achieve the entity\u2019s  objectives.", "Each EPA regional office\u2019s approach to providing resources to states and  school districts varies based on differing regional priorities and available  resources, according to EPA headquarters officials. Additionally, officials  said that this decentralized model of providing support and technical  assistance related to lead testing and remediation in schools is  appropriate because of the number of schools across the United States.  However, based on our survey we found school district familiarity with the  3Ts guidance varied by geographic area (see fig. 8). An estimated 54  percent of school districts in the Northeast reported familiarity with the  3Ts guidance, compared with 17 percent of districts in the South.  Furthermore, the Northeast was the only geographic area with more  school districts reporting that they were familiar with the 3Ts guidance  than not. This awareness corresponds with the efforts made by the state  of Massachusetts and EPA\u2019s regional offices in the Northeast to distribute  the 3Ts guidance and conduct lead testing and remediation in school  districts.", "By promoting further efforts to communicate the importance of lead  testing to schools to help ensure that their lead testing programs are in  line with good practices included in the 3Ts guidance, EPA regional  offices that have not focused on this issue could leverage the recent  efforts of other regional offices to provide technical assistance and  guidance, and other forms of support.", "EPA\u2019s 3Ts guidance emphasizes the importance of taking action to  remediate elevated lead in school drinking water, but the agency\u2019s  guidance on a recommended action level for states and school districts is  not current and contains elements that could be misleading. Although the  guidance recommends that school districts prioritize taking action if lead  levels from water fountains and other outlets used for consumption  exceed 20 ppb (based on a 250 milliliter water sample), EPA officials told  us when the guidance was originally developed in response to the 1988  LCCA requirement, the agency did not have information available to  recommend an action level specifically designed for schools.  Furthermore, EPA officials told us that the action level in the 3Ts  guidance is not a health-based standard. However, there are statements  in the guidance that appear to suggest otherwise. For example, the  guidance states that EPA strongly recommends that all water outlets in all  schools that provide water for drinking or cooking meet a \u201cstandard\u201d of 20  ppb lead or less and that school officials who follow the steps included in  the document, including using a 20 ppb action level, will be \u201cassured\u201d that  school facilities do not have elevated lead in the drinking water. The use  of the terms \u201cstandard\u201d and \u201cassured\u201d are potentially misleading and  could suggest that the 20 ppb action level is protective of health.", "Further, state and school district officials may be familiar with the 15 ppb  action level (based on a 1 liter water sample) for public water systems  aimed at identifying system-wide problems under the LCR, which may  also create confusion around the 20 ppb action level included in the 3Ts  guidance. According to our survey, an estimated 67 percent of school  districts reported using an action level less than the 20 ppb recommended  in the 3Ts guidance. We found that nearly half of school districts used  action levels between 15 ppb and 19 ppb. Although these action levels\u2014 the 20 ppb from the 3Ts guidance and the 15 ppb from the LCR\u2014are  intended for different purposes, the difference creates confusion for some  state and school district officials. Also, according to our survey, an  estimated 56 percent of school districts reported they would find it helpful  to have clearer guidance on what level of lead to use as the action level  for deciding to take steps to remediate lead in drinking water. In  addition, officials we interviewed in four of the five states we visited said  there is a need for clearer guidance on the action level. EPA officials  agreed that the difference between the two action levels creates  confusion for states and school districts.", "In addition to wanting clearer guidance on choosing lead action levels,  about half of the school districts we surveyed said they would also like  additional information to help inform their lead testing and remediation  programs. Specifically, school districts reported that they want information  on a recommended schedule for lead testing, how to remediate elevated  lead levels, and information associated with testing and remediation costs  (see fig. 9). For example, an estimated 54 percent of school districts  responded that they would like additional information on a testing  schedule, as did officials in 10 of the 17 school districts and one of the  five states we interviewed. EPA\u2019s 3Ts guidance does not include  information to help school districts determine a schedule for retesting their  schools. Officials in one school district told us they need information for  determining retesting schedules for lead in their school drinking water,  and that\u2014without guidance\u2014they chose to retest every 5 years,  acknowledging that this decision was made without a clear rationale.  Further, an estimated 62 percent of school districts reported wanting  additional information on remedial actions to take to address elevated  lead. For example, officials from the Massachusetts Department of  Environmental Protection told us that they would like additional guidance  on evaluating remedial actions to address elevated lead in the fixtures or  the plumbing system. Officials with EPA\u2019s Office of Ground Water and  Drinking Water hold quarterly meetings with regional officials to obtain  input on potential improvements to the 3Ts guidance, but have not made  any revisions.", "EPA has not substantially updated the 3Ts guidance since October 2006  and does not have firm plans or time frames for providing additional  information, including on the action level and other key topics such as a  recommended schedule for testing. EPA officials said that they may  update the 3Ts guidance before the LCR is updated, but did not provide a  specific time frame for doing so.  EPA has efforts underway to reconsider  the action level for the LCR, which may include a change in the action  level from one that is based on technical feasibility, to one that also  considers lead exposure in vulnerable populations such as infants and  young children, which EPA refers to as a health-based benchmark. EPA  anticipates issuing comprehensive revisions to the LCR by February  2020. While the 3Ts guidance is not contingent on the LCR, EPA officials  told us they would consider updates to the 3Ts guidance, including the 20  ppb action level, as they consider revisions to the LCR. By updating the 3Ts guidance to include an action level for school districts that  incorporates available scientific modeling regarding vulnerable population  exposures, EPA could have greater assurance that school districts are  able to limit children\u2019s exposure to lead.", "EPA has emphasized the importance of addressing elevated lead levels  in school drinking water through its 3Ts guidance, but has not  communicated necessary information about action levels and other key  topics consistent with the external communication standard under federal  standards for internal control. According to EPA, CDC, and others,  eliminating sources of lead before exposure can occur is considered the  best strategy to protect children from potential adverse health outcomes.  EPA officials also told us that clear guidance is important because testing  for lead in drinking water requires technical expertise. But without  providing interim or updated guidance to help school districts choose an  action level for lead remediation EPA will continue to provide schools with  confusing information regarding whether to remediate, which may not  adequately limit potential lead exposure to students and staff.  Furthermore, without important information on key topics, such as a  recommended schedule for lead testing, how to remediate elevated lead  levels, and information associated with testing and remediation costs  school districts are at risk of making misinformed decisions regarding  their lead testing and remediation efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education Has Not Played a Significant Role in Lead Testing and Remediation in Schools or Collaborated with EPA on These Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Education has not played a significant role in supporting state and school  districts efforts to test for and remediate lead in school drinking water, and  there has been limited collaboration between Education and EPA,  according to officials.

The survey included questions about school  district efforts to test for lead in school drinking water, such as the number  of schools in which tests were conducted, the costs of testing, and  whether parents or others were notified about the testing efforts. We also  asked questions about remediation efforts, such as whether lead was  discovered in school drinking water, the specific remediation efforts that  were implemented, and whether parents or others were notified about the  remediation efforts. Further, we asked about officials\u2019 familiarity with the  Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) guidance entitled 3Ts for  Reducing Lead in Drinking Water in Schools, (3Ts guidance) whether the  guidance was used, and the extent to which it was helpful in conducting  tests, remediating lead, and communicating with parents and others. We  directed the survey to school district superintendents or other cognizant  officials, such as facilities directors. See appendix II which includes the  survey questions and estimates.", "We defined our target population to be all school districts in the 50 U.S.  states and the District of Columbia that are not under the jurisdiction of  the Department of Defense or Bureau of Indian Education. We used the  LEA Universe database from Department of Education\u2019s (Education)  Common Core of Data (CCD) for the 2014-2015 school year to our  sampling frame. For the purpose of our survey, our sample was limited to  school districts that: were located in the District of Columbia or the 50 states; had a LEA type code of 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8; had one or more schools and one or more students; and were not closed according to the 2014-2015 School Year.", "The resulting sample frame included 16,452 school districts and we  selected a stratified random sample of 549 school districts. We stratified  the sampling frame into 13 mutually exclusive strata based on urban  classification and poverty classification. We further stratified the school  districts classified as being in a city by charter status. We selected the  largest 100 school districts with certainty. We determined the minimum  sample size needed to achieve precision levels of plus or minus 12  percentage points or fewer, at the 95 percent confidence level. We then  increased the sample size within each stratum for an expected response  rate of 70 percent.", "We defined the three urban classifications based on the National Center  for Education Statistics (NCES) urban-centric locale code. To build a  general measure of the poverty level for each school district we used the  proportion of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (FRPL) as  indicated in the CCD data and classified these into the following three  groups:", "High-poverty \u2013 More than 75 percent of students in the school district  were eligible for FRPL;", "Mid-poverty \u2013 Between 25.1 and 75.0 percent of students in the  school district were eligible for FRPL; and", "Low-poverty \u2013 25 percent or fewer students in the school district were  eligible for FRPL.", "We assessed the reliability of the CCD data by reviewing existing  documentation about the data and performing electronic testing on  required data elements and determined they were sufficiently reliable for  the purpose of our report.", "We administered the survey from July to October 2017 (the survey asked  school districts to report information based on the 12 months prior to their  completing the survey.) To obtain the maximum number of responses to  our survey, we sent reminder emails to nonrespondents and contacted  nonrespondents over the telephone. We identified that four of the 549  sampled school districts were closed and one was a \u201ccyber-school\u201d with  no building, so these were removed from the sample. Of the remaining  544 eligible sampled school districts, we received valid responses from  373, resulting in an unweighted response rate of 68 percent.", "We conducted an analysis of our survey results to identify potential  sources of nonresponse bias using a multivariate logistic regression  model. We examined the response propensity of the sampled school  districts by several demographic characteristics. These characteristics  included poverty, urbanicity, and charter status. We did not find any other  population characteristics significantly affected survey response  propensity except those used in stratification (charter schools and the  largest 100 school districts). Based on the response bias analysis and the  68 percent response rate across stratum, we determined that estimates  based on adjusted weights reflecting the response rate are generalizable  to the population of eligible school districts and are sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of this report.", "We took steps to minimize non-sampling errors, including pretesting draft  instruments and using a web-based administration system.

In the pretests, we asked about the clarity of  the questions and the flow and layout of the survey. The EPA also  reviewed and provided us comments on a draft version of the survey.  Based on feedback from the pretests and EPA\u2019s review, we made  revisions to the survey instrument. To further minimize non-sampling  errors, we used a web-based survey, which allowed respondents to enter  their responses directly into an electronic instrument.

As a  result, charters schools vary in terms of whether they own their own  building or pay rent, and whether they operate in buildings originally  designed as a school or in buildings which have been redesigned for  educational purposes. Sometimes charter schools may also share space  in their building with others, such as non-profit organizations. In addition  to differences in facility access and finance, charter school governance  also varies. In some states, charter schools function as their own school  district, while in other states, charter schools have the option to choose  between being a distinct school district or part of a larger school district.", "To determine the extent to which charter school districts were testing for  lead in school drinking water and finding and remediating lead, our survey  included charter school districts in two ways: our sampling design  included three strata specifically for charter school districts in urban  areas; in addition, charter school districts were retained in the sampling  population, such that they could be randomly selected in our other strata.  While we generally received too few responses from charter school  districts to report their data separately, we are able to estimate that about  36 percent of charter school districts tested for lead in school drinking  water.", "To learn more about experiences of charter schools, we visited one  charter school district and interviewed representatives of the DC Public  Charter School Board (DC PCSB).", "The charter school district we visited consisted of one charter school  in a building it leased. The school had 10 sources of consumable  water, all of which were tested in 2016 and were found to have lead  below the district\u2019s selected action level of 15 parts per billion. Before  testing, district officials met with the building owner who agreed to  cover the cost of any remediation.", "Officials with the DC PCSB told us that it paid to have tests conducted  in every charter school in the District of Columbia. According to DC  PCSB officials, between March and June 2016, 95 charter schools  were tested, and lead above their action level of 15 parts per billion  was discovered in 20 schools. Officials estimated their testing costs to  be about $100,000, which was subsequently reimbursed by the  District of Columbia\u2019s Office of State Superintendent of Education.  They also said that charter schools were responsible for taking steps  to remediate the lead and recommended schools flush their water  systems and use filters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Testing Components for Eight States That Require School Districts to Test for Lead in Drinking Water", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Action level and sample size Not specified", "paragraphs": ["Communication  of results  Not specified 5 ppb in a 250  ml sample  (from filtered  fixture)"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: EPA Guidance to the Public on Reducing Lead in Drinking Water", "paragraphs": ["The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides information on its  website for the public on lead in drinking water.
