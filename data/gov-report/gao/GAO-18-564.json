The agency also has processes to review that the correct federal matching rates were applied to expenditures receiving a higher than standard federal matching rate, which can include certain types of services and populations. These processes collectively have had a considerable federal financial benefit, with CMS resolving errors that reduced federal spending by over $5.1 billion in fiscal years 2014 through 2017.", "However, GAO identified weaknesses in how CMS targets its resources to address risks when reviewing whether expenditures are supported and consistent with requirements.", "CMS devotes similar levels of staff resources to review expenditures despite differing levels of risk across states. For example, the number of staff reviewing California's expenditures\u2014which represent 15 percent of federal Medicaid spending\u2014is similar to the number reviewing Arkansas' expenditures, which represents 1 percent of federal Medicaid spending.", "CMS cancelled in-depth financial management reviews in 17 out of 51 instances over the last 5 years. These reviews target expenditures considered by CMS to be at risk of not meeting program requirements.", "CMS told GAO that resource constraints contributed to both weaknesses. However, the agency has not completed a comprehensive assessment of risk to (1) determine whether oversight resources are adequate and (2) focus on the most significant areas of risk. Absent such an assessment, CMS is missing an opportunity to identify errors in reported expenditures that could result in substantial savings to the Medicaid program.", "GAO also found limitations in CMS's processes for reviewing expenditures that receive a higher federal matching rate.", "Internal guidance for examining variances in these expenditures was unclear, and not all reviewers in the three CMS regional offices GAO reviewed were investigating significant variances in quarter-to-quarter expenditures.", "Review procedures for expenditures for individuals newly eligible for Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act were not tailored to different risk levels among states. For example, in its reviews of a sample of claims for this population, CMS reviewed claims for the same number of enrollees\u201430\u2014in California as for Arkansas, even though California had 10 times the number of newly eligible enrollees as Arkansas.", "Without clear internal guidance and better targeting of risks in its review procedures for expenditures receiving higher matching rates, CMS may overpay states."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making three recommendations, including that CMS improve its risk-based targeting of oversight efforts and resources, and clarify related internal guidance.

In fiscal year 2017, Medicaid covered an estimated  73.5 million individuals at an estimated cost of $596 billion, including  about $369 billion in federal spending. Federal projections indicate that  those costs will continue to grow.", "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency within  the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that oversees  Medicaid, is responsible for providing federal funds on the basis of state  estimates of expenditures. CMS subsequently reconciles states\u2019 actual  expenditures against those estimates. Thus, a key part of CMS\u2019s  oversight responsibility is to review state-reported expenditures to assure  that they are supported and consistent with Medicaid requirements. Each  quarter, states report their expenditures to CMS through its CMS-64 form.  CMS regional offices are responsible for reviewing these reported  expenditures and working with states to resolve any questionable  expenditures. If CMS identifies errors\u2014which can include (1) errors in the  amounts reported or (2) reported expenditures that are not allowable\u2014the  agency can require states to reduce reported expenditures or return  federal funds. Because Medicaid requirements include higher than  standard federal matching rates for certain types of services and for  certain populations of enrollees, part of CMS\u2019s review process is to  assure that expenditures are being matched at the correct rate. For  example, states receive higher matching rates for services provided in  Indian Health Service (IHS) facilities and for family planning services.  They also receive higher matching rates for individuals newly eligible  under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), referred  to in this report as Medicaid expansion enrollees.", "While there is a common reporting form, state expenditure reporting  varies depending upon the populations and services states cover and  how they deliver and finance care. These variations reflect the diversity of  the design of states\u2019 Medicaid programs; however, the task of reviewing  reported expenditures has grown increasingly complex due to this  variation, and is further complicated by the growing number of different  federal matching rates for expenditures. When reporting errors or  inappropriate expenditures go undetected, it can result in overpayment by  the federal government.", "Given the significance of federal Medicaid expenditures and past  concerns about the challenges CMS has faced in ensuring that  expenditures are being matched at the correct rate, you asked us to  examine CMS oversight of state-reported expenditures. This report  examines the following:  1.  CMS\u2019s policies and procedures for assuring that state-reported  Medicaid expenditures are supported and consistent with Medicaid  requirements.  2.  How CMS assures that correct federal matching rates are applied to  expenditures subject to a higher than standard matching rate.  3.  The financial impact of CMS\u2019s efforts to resolve errors in reported  expenditures.", "To examine CMS\u2019s policies and procedures for assuring that state- reported Medicaid expenditures are supported and consistent with  Medicaid requirements, we reviewed CMS\u2019s internal guidance to regional  offices on conducting quarterly reviews of reported expenditures. We also  reviewed CMS\u2019s guidance to states on reporting expenditures, including  the reporting forms. To examine how CMS\u2019s regional offices implemented  this guidance, we selected 3 of 10 regional offices to achieve geographic  variation. We selected regional offices 3, 6, and 9, which cover states in  the East, South, and West of the United States. Within our three regional  offices, we selected six states to review CMS\u2019s oversight: Arkansas,  California, Maryland, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Texas. We selected  these states to achieve variation in program expenditures, enrollment,  and program features, including whether they expanded Medicaid  eligibility under PPACA. Together these six states account for  approximately 30 percent of total federal Medicaid expenditures in fiscal  year 2015. We visited our selected regional offices to conduct a  walkthrough of their review of expenditures for our selected states for the  most recently completed quarter at the time we planned our site visits,  generally the first quarter of fiscal year 2017.", "We obtained and examined copies of reviewers\u2019 documentation of the  steps taken to complete their quarterly reviews in the six selected states,  including the completed review guides, summary memos, and  correspondence with state officials. We also reviewed CMS\u2019s internal  guidance for conducting financial management reviews, and obtained and  examined documentation of reviews conducted from 2014 through 2017  (the first 4 years of expansion under PPACA), and resources assigned to  review functions. In reviewing documentation of the quarterly reviews and  the financial management reviews, we determined whether current  procedures were resulting in reviewers identifying errors, but did not  assess the magnitude of the errors identified. We interviewed officials  from CMS\u2019s central office and our three selected regional offices about  their review policies, processes, and resources. We also interviewed  Medicaid officials from our six selected states about their experiences  submitting data and undergoing CMS\u2019s review processes. In evaluating  this information, we compared policies and procedures against the  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government.", "To examine how CMS assures that correct matching rates are applied to  expenditures, we reviewed CMS policies and procedures for reviewing  expenditures subject to a higher than standard federal matching rate,  including the quarterly review guide. In addition, we examined the extent  to which these were consistently applied by reviewing the quarterly review  documentation for our three selected regional offices. Specifically, we  examined how they reviewed expenditure reporting for four types of  expenditures for which states receive a higher federal matching rate: IHS,  services for certain women with breast or cervical cancer, family planning,  and Medicaid expansion. We selected these four expenditure types  because they cover a variety of services and populations, and under  CMS\u2019s quarterly review guidance, they are subject to specific review  procedures. We also tested CMS\u2019s reviews by completing our own  reviews of reported expenditures in the six states. Specifically, we  calculated the variance in expenditures from the quarter under review to  the previous quarter, which is in line with CMS\u2019s review guidance. We  also interviewed CMS officials, including officials in our selected regional  offices about their review process. In evaluating the measures CMS has  taken to assure that correct matching rates are applied to different  expenditures, we compared policies and procedures against the  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government.", "To examine the financial impact of errors resolved by CMS, we reviewed  data on errors resolved in fiscal years 2014 through 2017, the four most  recent years of available data. Specifically, we reviewed data on the  magnitude of errors resolved through states reducing reported  expenditures and on errors resolved by CMS issuing a disallowance,  which requires a state to return federal funds. We also reviewed data on  deferrals of federal funds (i.e., CMS defers payment until issues are  resolved) as of the end of fiscal year 2017. We asked CMS officials  responsible for overseeing data on errors to describe the reliability of the  data, including any limitations. For the data on disallowances, deferrals,  and errors resolved by states reducing reported expenditures, we  reviewed relevant documentation; examined the data for obvious errors,  such as missing values; and compared the results to other supporting  documentation to ensure accuracy, when possible. We determined that  all data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting  objectives. We also reviewed the documentation from the three selected  regional offices\u2019 quarterly expenditure reviews for examples of errors  resolved in our six selected states. Using the data on disallowances, and  documentation from the quarterly expenditure reviews, we analyzed the  range in types of errors and the range in the financial impact of errors  resolved by CMS.

CMS  review procedures include validation measures that check to ensure that  expenditures were reported within the 2-year limit, which is a check done  on all types of expenditures. Another validation measure compares  expenditures to various approval documents. For example, when a state  has a waiver in place, expenditures are reviewed against waiver  agreements that authorize payment for specified services or populations.  Other examples include comparing supplemental payment expenditures  to caps set for those expenditures. (See table 3.)", "Our examination of the quarterly reviews indicated that the reviews  involved significant coordination with other CMS staff and the state. In  addition to reviewing state documentation, officials from two regional  offices told us that they consult other regional office staff who oversee the  approval of new expenditures to ensure that expenditures reflect  approved program features. For example, officials in region 9 told us that  in reviewing managed care expenditures, they consult with their  colleagues who review the state\u2019s payment methodologies for capitated  payments. In reviewing information technology development  expenditures\u2014which are subject to a higher federal matching rate\u2014 reviewers for all six selected states examined advanced planning  documents, which requires coordination with staff who approve those  documents to ensure that the state was receiving the correct matching  rates and staying within the approved amounts. With regard to  coordination with states, we found that regional reviewers for all six  reviews contacted states to follow-up on issues identified during the  review. Officials also described being in regular contact with states to stay  abreast of program, system, and staffing changes to inform their reviews.  For example, according to regional officials, Arkansas experienced some  significant and unexpected staffing challenges in 2016 that resulted in  delays in the state reporting expenditures and returning federal  overpayments, and the reviewer worked closely with state staff to track  the state\u2019s progress.", "We found evidence that reviewers identified errors during their quarterly  reviews. In the six quarterly reviews we examined, regional offices  identified errors in three of the six states. For example, region 3  reviewers found errors in Maryland\u2019s expenditure reporting\u2014including  claims for the wrong matching rate for two enrollees who were not eligible  for PPACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion and reporting provider incentive  payments on the wrong line\u2014and worked with the state to correct those  errors. Additionally, region 9 reviewers found errors in California\u2019s  reporting of expenditures. For example, they found that the state reported  waiver expenditures for the incorrect time period, which has implications  for CMS\u2019s ability to monitor and enforce spending limits for the waiver.  Reviewers worked with the state to correct those errors.", "To supplement the quarterly reviews, CMS generally directs regional  offices to conduct a focused financial management review (FMR) each  year on an area of high risk within the region, typically within one state.  According to regional officials, CMS uses these reviews to investigate  expenditures in greater depth and detail than is reasonable within the  timeframes of a quarterly review. For example, reviewers can examine  individual claims for services from providers or the methodologies  developed for certain payment types. Regional reviewers also use these  reviews to investigate errors that could not have been detected by the  quarterly review. For example, regional office 6 officials told us that they  uncovered inappropriate financing arrangements when they used an FMR  to examine how Texas financed the state share of its supplemental  payments to hospitals in one of its counties. To do so, the regional office  reviewed payments from the state to the provider, project plans, and  interviewed providers\u2014steps that are not part of the quarterly review  process. Rather, in the quarterly review, the reviewer only checks that  state-reported payments are supported by state accounting records and  are within applicable caps; thus, inappropriate financing of the state share  would not have been detected through the quarterly review.", "In fiscal years 2014 through 2017, CMS used FMRs to review various  expenditures considered to be at risk for not complying with Medicaid  requirements. Specifically, as outlined in annual work plans, regional  offices planned to conduct 31 FMRs and estimated that the total amount  of federal funds at risk in expenditure areas covered by their planned  reviews was $12 billion. (See app. I.) Planned FMRs targeted a wide  range of topics, with the reviews most frequently targeting expenditures  for the Medicaid expansion population. (See table 4.)", "We found that CMS frequently identified compliance issues through  FMRs. As of March 2018, CMS reported that reviewers had identified  compliance issues with financial impact in 11 of the 31 planned FMRs,  though most of those findings were still under review. More findings from  the planned FMRs are likely as some of the reviews were still ongoing.  We reviewed the draft results for 5 FMRs. Among these, CMS found  that four states were reporting expenditures that were not allowable. For  example, as noted earlier, a 2014 FMR on supplemental payments in  Texas revealed inappropriate funding arrangements, and CMS issued a  disallowance for approximately $27 million. In some cases, FMRs did not  have apparent financial findings, but identified significant internal control  weaknesses in the state and recommended specific corrective actions\u2014 such as better aligning eligibility and expenditures systems to better  detect and correct irregularities\u2014that would provide greater assurances  that federal funds are appropriately spent.", "Both the quarterly reviews and the FMRs occur in conjunction with other  ongoing CMS financial oversight activities. For example in addition to  reviewing expenditures, regional office reviewers assess how states  estimate their costs, set payment rates for managed care and home and  community based services, and allocate costs among different Medicaid  administrative activities under their cost allocation plans. CMS officials  told us that issues relating to state compliance with Medicaid  requirements for expenditures could be identified during these other  oversight activities and could inform follow-up during the quarterly reviews  or be the subject of a FMR. Officials also told us that since FMRs were  instituted, the agency has built in more front-end procedures for  preventing problems with the accuracy and allowability of reported  expenditures. As examples, they cited their work on managed care rate  reviews, among other things."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Weaknesses Limit CMS\u2019s Ability to Effectively Target Risk in Its Oversight of Expenditures", "paragraphs": ["We identified two weaknesses in how CMS is allocating resources for  overseeing state-reported expenditures that limited the agency\u2019s ability to  target risk in its efforts to assure that these expenditures are supported  and consistent with Medicaid requirements. First, we found that CMS has  allocated similar staff resources to states with differing levels of risk. For  example, the staff resources dedicated to reviewing California\u2019s  expenditures\u2014ranking first nationally in expenditures and constituting 15  percent of all federal Medicaid expenditures\u2014are comparable to  significantly smaller states in other regions, despite California\u2019s history of  reporting challenges and its inability to provide electronic records, which  requires on-site review. (See fig. 3.) CMS has allocated 2.2 staff to  review California\u2019s expenditures in contrast to one person to review  Arkansas\u2019 expenditures, which constitute 1 percent of federal Medicaid  expenditures, and Arkansas does not have a similar history of complex  reporting challenges. We also found that California\u2019s reviewers have set a  higher threshold for investigating variances in reported expenditures than  in the five other selected states. Specifically, reviewers investigated  variances in California of plus or minus 10 percent if the variances  represented more than 2 percent of medical expenditures, or $450 million  in the quarter we reviewed. The state experienced an approximately 24  percent increase in its prescription drug expenditures\u2014roughly $200  million\u2014during that quarter, but the variance was deemed not  significant. In contrast, for two of our five other selected states, we  found that reviewers generally investigated variances of plus or minus 10  percent regardless of the dollar amount of the variance and in the  remaining three states they had significantly lower dollar thresholds than  used for California.", "Second, CMS reported cancelling the FMR requirement for regional  offices in 17 out of 51 instances in the last 5 years when faced with  resource constraints. In some cases, CMS excused individual regional  offices from conducting planned FMRs due to staff shortage as the  agency did for regions 3 and 7 in 2014; region 8 in 2016; and regions 3,  7, 8, and 9 in 2018. In 2015, according to CMS officials, all 10 regions  were excused from conducting an FMR, because the regional offices  needed their staff to focus on implementing new procedures for validating  expenditures for the Medicaid expansion population. In addition to  cancelling FMRs, CMS was delayed in finalizing FMRs. Among the eight  FMRs that were conducted in fiscal year 2014,  three have been issued as final reports,", "CMS decided no report was needed on a fourth, and  the four remaining FMRs from 2014 were still under review as of  March 2018, delaying important feedback to states on their  vulnerabilities.", "According to CMS officials, resource constraints have contributed to both  of these weaknesses. Our analysis of staffing data indicated that, from  fiscal years 2014 to 2018, the number of full time equivalent staff  dedicated to financial oversight activities declined by approximately 19  percent across all 10 regions. These staff are responsible not only for  completing the quarterly reviews and FMRs, but also other financial  oversight activities, including resolving audit findings and other on-going  oversight activities noted previously. During this period, federal  Medicaid expenditures are estimated to have increased by approximately  31 percent, and the reporting of expenditures has grown more complex.  In addition to the decline in dedicated staff, officials told us they faced  challenges in filling vacancies either because of hiring restrictions or  challenges in recruiting qualified candidates. Officials described  instances where regional offices shared resources with other offices to  address critical gaps in resources. For example region 9 was able to  obtain part-time assistance from a region 6 reviewer to help review  California\u2019s expenditures. However, CMS officials told us that they had  not permanently reallocated resources between regional offices, because  all regional offices are under-resourced given their various oversight  responsibilities as of May 2018. With regard to cancelling FMRs, CMS  officials noted that other oversight responsibilities, including the quarterly  reviews, are required under statute or regulation and thus have a higher  priority than FMRs.", "Compounding its resource allocation challenges, CMS has not conducted  a comprehensive, national assessment of risk to determine whether  resources for financial oversight activities are (1) adequate and (2)  allocated\u2014both across regional offices and oversight tools\u2014to focus on  the greatest areas of risk. Agency officials told us that they have not  conducted a formal risk assessment, because they are assessing risk on  an on-going basis, allocating resources within each region accordingly  and sharing resources across regions to the extent possible. However,  this approach does not make clear whether the level of resources  dedicated to financial oversight nationally is adequate given the risk.", "Federal internal control standards for risk assessment require agencies to  identify and analyze risks related to achieving the defined objectives (i.e.,  assuring that state-reported expenditures are in accordance with  Medicaid rules), and respond to risks based on the significance of the  risk. Without completing a comprehensive, national assessment of risk  and determining whether staff resources dedicated to financial oversight  are adequate and allocated commensurate with risk, CMS is missing an  opportunity to improve its ability to identify errors in reported expenditures  that could result in hundreds of millions of dollars in potential savings to  the Medicaid program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Vulnerabilities Exist in CMS\u2019s Review of Expenditures for Which States Receive Higher Federal Matching Rates", "paragraphs": ["CMS reviewers in the selected regional offices we reviewed did not  consistently perform variance analyses\u2014which compare changes in  expenditures from the quarter under review to the previous quarter\u2014of  higher matched expenditures during quarterly reviews.

Although CMS reviewers said they thought the standard  analysis was sufficient, net changes within a broad service category  may obscure major changes within these higher matched  expenditures. For example, examining changes in total inpatient  hospital expenditures would not necessarily reveal a significant  variance limited to inpatient expenditures in IHS facilities that receive  a higher federal match.", "CMS region 9. Reviewers told us that they examined higher matched  expenditures for California; however, no variance analyses of IHS,  family planning, or breast or cervical cancer services were included in  the work papers provided to us.

Our analysis indicated that variances in spending for  these three services ranged widely across our six states, and in four of  the states, some of their expenditures were above the thresholds for  significance.

For example, in regional office 3, Maryland  experienced a significant variance in its family planning expenditures\u2014an  increase of approximately $8 million dollars or 7,700 percent from the  previous quarter\u2014but there was no indication in the documentation  provided that the regional office identified or investigated that variance.", "Similar to the variance analyses for other higher matched expenditure  types, we found that the selected regional offices did not consistently  conduct variance analyses on expenditures reported for the Medicaid  expansion population. First, although five of our six states opted to  expand Medicaid under PPACA, two of the five states (Maryland and  Pennsylvania) were not subjected to a variance analysis for their  expansion populations, a segment that accounted for nearly $7 billion in  Medicaid expenditures in fiscal year 2016. Among the remaining three  states, CMS regional office staff conducted a variance analysis, but in two  of them, the reviewers did not document whether they investigated  significant variances, leaving it unclear whether this required step was  taken.

For example:", "For IHS, family planning, and certain women with breast or cervical  cancer, the guidance is explicit that the analysis is required, but the  automated variance report used by reviewers for the step does not  include these expenditures.", "For Medicaid expansion expenditures, the review guide is not explicit  about whether a variance analysis is required, but CMS has an  automated variance report available for these expenditures, which  suggests that such an analysis was expected.", "The guidance suggests that a variance analysis should be conducted  for expansion enrollees; however, it does not specify whether the  analysis should be conducted in conjunction with\u2014or take the place  of\u2014more in-depth examinations.", "According to federal internal controls standards for information and  communication, agencies should communicate the information necessary  for staff to achieve the agency\u2019s objectives. CMS\u2019s guidance on  conducting variance analyses for types of expenditures with higher  federal matching rates has not been sufficiently clear to assure that such  analyses are being consistently conducted. By not consistently  conducting such checks, errors may be going undetected and CMS may  be providing federal funds at a higher matching rate than is allowable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Sampling Procedures Used to Examine Medicaid Expansion Expenditures Did Not Account for Varying Risks across States", "paragraphs": ["CMS has additional procedures in place to review service expenditures  reported for the Medicaid expansion population, a category of  expenditures that received a 95 percent federal match in 2017.  Specifically, in addition to a variance analysis, CMS guidance specifies  that each regional office reviewer is to review claims for a sample. The  guide directs the reviewer to obtain a full list of all expansion enrollees  from the state and to select 30 to 40 for further review. Next, the reviewer  is to obtain supporting documentation from the state listing the eligibility  factors for the sampled enrollees, such as age, pregnancy status,  Medicare enrollment, and income. The reviewer is to select a single claim  for each enrollee and verify that the corresponding expenditures were  reported under the correct federal matching rate category\u2014i.e., that the  sample claim for each individual was accounted for in the relevant section  of the CMS-64. The review guide specifies that the sample review be  conducted each quarter unless the state has had four consecutive  quarters with three or fewer errors, in which case, the sampling must be  performed only annually.", "We found that regional offices were identifying errors in their sampling  reviews. For example, region 3 reviewers found that Pennsylvania had  incorrectly categorized an individual in the sample as a Medicaid  expansion enrollee, with the selected expenditures initially reported as  eligible for the higher matching rate. According to CMS central office  officials, the sampling methodology has helped identify systemic issues  with state expenditure systems in some states and resulted in corrections,  adjustments, and in one case, a disallowance. Under current procedures,  among our five selected states that expanded Medicaid under PPACA, all  five were determined to have had four consecutive clean quarters  according to agency officials; that is, the state had three or fewer errors in  each quarter. Nationally, all but one of the 33 states that have  implemented Medicaid expansion under PPACA had four consecutive  clean quarters as of March 2018, according to CMS officials.", "We found, however, that CMS\u2019s procedures for sampling reviews had a  key weakness in that they did not account for varying risks across states,  as illustrated in the following examples.", "We found that sample size does not account for significant differences  in program size. For example, both California and Arkansas have  expanded Medicaid under PPACA, and regional office staff told us  they reviewed claims for 30 expansion enrollees in each of the two  states, despite the fact that California has over 10 times as many  expansion enrollees as Arkansas. Region 9 officials told us that for  California they had initially sampled 100 enrollees during the first  quarter they were required to conduct this analysis, but the review  was time consuming given staff resources, and they were advised by  CMS\u2019s central office to limit their sample to 30 individuals. CMS  officials told us that the sampling procedures are resource intensive  and that the sample size they decided upon was what they thought  they had the resources to complete.", "Additionally, the sample size does not account for previously identified  risks in a state\u2019s program. Specifically, as we noted in a 2015 report,  CMS\u2019s sampling review of expansion expenditures was not linked to  or informed by reviews of eligibility determinations conducted by CMS,  some of which identified high levels of eligibility determination  errors. According to CMS officials, the expenditure review is  primarily intended to ensure that states are correctly assigning  expenditures for the expanded eligibility groups as initially determined,  not whether the eligibility determination is correct.", "Federal standards for internal control related to risk assessment require  that agencies identify, analyze, and respond to risks. However, because  CMS\u2019s sampling methodology does not account for risk factors like  program size and high levels of eligibility determination errors, the  agency\u2019s review of expansion population expenditures may be missing  opportunities to detect systemic issues with improperly matched  expenditures.", "Quarterly variance analyses and sampling of Medicaid expansion  enrollees can be supplemented by financial management reviews. For  fiscal year 2016, CMS recommended regional offices conduct FMRs on  expenditure claims for expansion enrollees. As of March 2018, however,  regional offices had completed an FMR on Medicaid expansion  expenditures in only one state, with no findings, and were in the process  of completing FMRs for five other states. According to CMS officials, no  additional reviews in this area were planned for fiscal year 2018."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CMS Resolved over $5.1 Billion in Expenditure Errors in Fiscal Years 2014 through 2017", "paragraphs": ["Financial Impact of Expenditure Reviews  Compared with Program Integrity  Recoveries   The impact of CMS\u2019s expenditure review  activities is greater than the impact from other  program integrity efforts. For example, in  fiscal year 2015, CMS resolved errors through  expenditure reviews that saved over $1.4  billion in federal funds. In the same year,  CMS reported that efforts by states and the  federal government to identify improper  payments to providers\u2014for example, services  that were billed by a provider but were not  received by a beneficiary\u2014resulted in  recoveries that totaled $852.9 million, in both  state and federal funds.", "In fiscal years 2014 through 2017, CMS\u2019s regional offices resolved  expenditure errors that reduced federal spending by over $5.1 billion, with  at least $1 billion in errors resolved in each of three of those four years.  Errors were resolved through states agreeing to reduce their reported  expenditures, which prevented federal payments to the state for those  expenditures; and through CMS issuing disallowances, under which  states are required to return federal funds. Although CMS resolved over  $1 billion in expenditure errors in each year of fiscal years 2014 through  2016, CMS resolved less than $600 million in fiscal year 2017. CMS  officials explained that this change likely reflects delays in clearance of  disallowances due to the transition between presidential administrations.  (See fig. 3.) In addition to these resolved errors, as of the end of 2017,  CMS had $4.47 billion in outstanding deferrals of federal funds, where  CMS was delaying federal funds until additional information was provided.  Expenditures flagged for deferrals may or may not represent errors.", "All 10 CMS regional offices resolved errors from fiscal years 2014 through  2017, though the magnitude varied across regions. (See table 5.) Among  the 10 regional offices, 9 reported that they had resolved errors through  states agreeing to reduce reported expenditures. Additionally, 9 regional  offices issued a total of 49 disallowances across 16 states, with the  majority of the disallowances occurring in regional offices 2 and 3. Finally,  all 10 regional offices had taken deferrals for questionable expenditures,  with 22 states having outstanding \u201cactive\u201d deferrals that had not been  resolved as of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, which ranged in  amount from $178 to $444 million. CMS officials told us that the range of  resolved errors and deferred funds across regional offices may reflect  differences in the proportion of high-expenditure states. For example,  regional office 4 oversees four states ranking in the top 20 in terms of  Medicaid expenditures, while regional office 8 does not oversee any top- 20 states. The variation may also reflect large actions taken in specific  states. For example, the majority of the disallowed funds in regional office  2 from fiscal years 2014 to 2017 were due to a single disallowance of  $1.26 billion in one state.", "The financial significance of individual errors resolved by CMS\u2019s regional  offices varied significantly. We found that regional offices resolved errors  that ranged from reporting errors that had no federal financial impact\u2014 such as expenditures that were allowable, but were reported on the  incorrect line\u2014to hundreds of millions of dollars in expenditures that were  found to be unallowable under Medicaid requirements. Over the fiscal  years we reviewed, more than half of the disallowances CMS issued were  less than $15 million; however, in four states CMS issued disallowances  of over $100 million, including a disallowance of over $1 billion in New  York. (See fig. 5.)", "In some cases, actions taken by CMS to resolve errors were the  culmination of years of work. For example, over several years the  California Medicaid program reported a large volume of expenditures for  which it did not yet have sufficient supporting documentation. The  regional office officials told us that the state reported these expenditures  in order to comply with the 2-year filing limit, and had reported these as  \u201cplaceholder claims,\u201d with the intention of providing additional support at a  later time. Over the course of at least 6 years, CMS deferred hundreds of  millions of dollars in federal funds related to these placeholder claims. Of  the active deferrals as of the end of fiscal year 2017, most of the total  amount of deferred funds was taken for expenditures in California, which  represented $3.4 billion of the $4.5 billion in total active deferrals.  According to CMS officials, in 2015, CMS prohibited California from  reporting additional placeholder claims. Region 9 officials told us that they  continue to work with the state to clear the deferrals related to this issue.  They were able to resolve 9 related deferrals in fiscal year 2017;  however, another over 60 deferrals were still unresolved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The growth of federal Medicaid expenditures, estimated at about $370  billion in fiscal year 2017, makes it critically important to assure  expenditures are consistent with Medicaid requirements. CMS has a  variety of processes in place to review state-reported expenditures, and  those reviews have resulted in CMS resolving errors that have saved the  federal government a considerable amount of money; over $5 billion in  the last 4 years. However, the increasing complexity of expenditure  reporting is occurring as resources to review these expenditures are  decreasing, hindering CMS\u2019s ability to target risk and potentially allowing  for hundreds of millions of federal dollars in errors to go undetected. In  the absence of a comprehensive risk assessment, which CMS has not  conducted, CMS may be missing opportunities to better target resources  to higher risk expenditures and increase the savings from these oversight  activities.", "The variety of different matching rates has contributed to the increased  complexity of CMS\u2019s expenditure reviews. Although CMS has review  procedures in place to assure that the correct matching rate is applied for  services and populations receiving a higher federal matching rate, unclear  guidance has contributed to inconsistency in the extent to which these  reviews are conducted. In addition, we found weaknesses in the sampling  methodology CMS requires its regional offices to use to help ensure that  expenditures for Medicaid expansion enrollees\u2014expenditures that  receive a higher matching rate and that represented almost 20 percent of  total federal Medicaid spending in 2016\u2014are consistent with Medicaid  requirements. In particular, the methodology does not account for risk  factors like program size or vulnerabilities in state eligibility-determination  processes and systems. As a result of the inconsistency in reviews and a  sampling methodology that does not consider program risk, errors may be  going undetected, resulting in CMS providing federal funds at higher  federal matching rates than is allowable.
