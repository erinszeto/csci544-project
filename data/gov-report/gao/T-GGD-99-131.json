The executive order says that federal agencies should refrain from establishing uniform, national standards for programs with federalism implications, and when national standards are required, they should consult with appropriate officials and organizations representing the states in developing those standards. The order says that regulations and other policies have federalism implications if they \u201chave substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.\u201d", "Executive Order 12612 also contains specific requirements for agencies. For example, the order requires the head of each agency to designate an official to be responsible for ensuring the implementation of the order. That official is required to determine which proposed policies have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a \u201cfederalism assessment.\u201d The assessment must contain certain elements (e.g., identify the extent to which the policy imposes additional costs or burdens on the states) and must accompany any proposed or final rule submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under Executive Order 12866. OMB, in turn, is required to ensure that agencies\u2019 rulemaking actions are consistent with the policies, criteria, and requirements in the federalism executive order.", "In May 1998, President Clinton issued Executive Order 13083 (\u201cFederalism\u201d), which was intended to replace both Executive Order 12612 and Executive Order 12875 (\u201cEnhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership\u201d). However, in August 1998, President Clinton suspended Executive Order 13083 in response to concerns raised by state and local government representatives and others about both the content of the order and the nonconsultative manner in which it was developed. Therefore, Executive Order 12612 remains in effect. rulemaking process.

As a result, we cannot comment on rules issued outside of that time frame.  Although Executive Order 12612 does not require agencies to mention the order in the preamble to their final rules or to note in those preambles whether a federalism assessment was prepared, doing so is a clear indication that the agency was aware of and considered the order\u2019s requirements.

However, rules that are \u201cmajor\u201d under SBREFA and that involve or affect state and local governments would seem more likely to have federalism implications that would warrant preparation of an assessment.", "However, that does not appear to have been the case. As figure 3 shows, of the 117 major final rules issued by covered agencies between April 1996 and December 1998, the preambles indicated that only 1 had a federalism assessment. The agencies had previously indicated that 37 of these rules would affect state and local governments, and the preambles to 21 of the rules indicated that they would preempt state and local laws in the event of a conflict. At least one of the four state and local government organizations that we consulted during the review said that federal agencies should have done assessments for most of these 117 major rules.

For example, in order for an EPA rule to require an assessment, the agency\u2019s guidance said the rule must meet all four of the following criteria: have an \u201cinstitutional\u201d effect on the states, not just a financial effect (regardless of magnitude); change significantly the relative roles of federal and state governments in a particular program context, lead to federal control over traditional state responsibilities, or decrease the ability of states to make policy decisions with respect to their own functions; affect all or most of the states; and have a direct, causal effect on the states (i.e., not a side effect).", "At least one of these criteria appeared to go beyond the executive order on which it is based. Although EPA said a rule must affect all or most of the states in order to have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of an assessment, Executive Order 12612 defines \u201cstate\u201d to \u201crefer to the States of the United States of America, individually or collectively.\u201d (Emphasis added.) EPA\u2019s guidance also said that, even if all four of these criteria are met, a rule would not require a federalism assessment if a statute mandates the action or the means to carry it out are implied by statute.

UMRA defines a \u201cmandate\u201d to be an \u201cenforceable duty\u201d that is not a condition of federal assistance and does not arise from participation in a voluntary federal program. For rules requiring a written statement, section 205 requires agencies to consider a number of regulatory alternatives and select the one that is the least costly, most cost-effective, or least burdensome and that achieves the purpose of the rule. Other sections of the act focus even more specifically on the interests of state and local representatives. For example, section 203 states that agencies must develop plans to involve small governments in the development of regulatory proposals that have a significant or unique effect on those entities. Section 204 requires agencies to develop processes to consult with representatives of state, local, and tribal governments in the development of regulatory proposals containing \u201csignificant ederal intergovernmental mandates.\u201d a condition of federal financial assistance or as a duty arising from participation in a voluntary program.

During the first 2 years of UMRA\u2019s implementation, the requirement in section 204 that agencies develop an intergovernmental consultation process appears to have applied to no more than four EPA rules and no rules from other agencies. EPA generally used a consultation process that was in place before UMRA was enacted. Also, section 203 small government plans were not developed for any of the 73 final rules promulgated during this 2-year period. Officials in the four agencies that we contacted said none of their final rules had a significant or unique effect on small governments.", "Section 208 of UMRA requires the Director of OMB to submit an annual report to Congress on agency compliance with UMRA. The fourth such report is scheduled to be delivered within the next few weeks. In his third UMRA report published in June 1998, the OMB Director noted that federal agencies had identified only three rules in the more than 3 years since the act was passed that affected the public sector enough to trigger the written statement requirements.

All of those assessments and statements require agencies to develop estimates of the costs attendant to the implementation of the regulation at issue. Also, both the bill and the executive order require identification of regulatory provisions that preempt state government authority or functions. not have federalism implications or prepare a federalism impact assessment. Neither Executive Order 12612 nor UMRA requires agencies to declare whether each of their proposed and final rules has federalism implications.

For example, according to the Small Business Administration\u2019s (SBA) Office of Advocacy, a perennial problem with the implementation of the RFA has been agencies\u2019 use of \u201cboilerplate\u201d certifications indicating that their rules do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Contributing to this problem is the fact that the RFA does not define the terms \u201csignificant economic impact\u201d and \u201csubstantial number of small entities,\u201d and no federal agency is responsible or authorized to define the terms. As a consequence, different agencies have different interpretations of the statute. We have recommended that Congress consider giving SBA or some other entity the responsibility or authority to define key terms in the act.

For example, in 1996, we reported on a joint goal and performance measure-setting effort between the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) and state governments. Initially, the federal-state relationship was not so cooperative. In 1994, OCSE specified the performance levels that states were expected to achieve in such areas as the establishment of paternity and collections of child support. State program officials strongly objected to this federal mandate because they did not have an opportunity to participate in the planning process.", "Following these initial planning efforts, OCSE sought to obtain wider participation from program officials at the federal, state, and local government levels. OCSE also established task forces consisting of federal, state, and local officials to help focus management of the program on long- term goals. During the planning process, participants agreed that the national goals and objectives would be based on the collective suggestions of the states and that the plan\u2019s final approval would be reached through a consensus. For each goal, the participants identified interim objectives that, if achieved, would represent progress toward the stated goal. At the time of our review, OCSE and the states were also developing performance measures to identify progress toward the goals, and planned to develop performance standards to judge the quality of state performance. They created a Performance Measures Work Group to develop statistical measures for assessing state progress toward achieving national goals and objectives. OCSE also encouraged its regional staff to develop performance agreements with states, specifying both general working relationships between OCSE regional offices and state program officials and performance goals for each state.", "Overall, OCSE and most state officials that we contacted said the joint planning process strengthened the federal/state partnership by enabling them to help shape the national program\u2019s long-term goals and objectives. State and local government stakeholder involvement has also been important in the development of practical and broadly accepted performance measures in other federal programs, including some block grants.  We believe that these kinds of intergovernmental cooperation can serve as models for the kinds of efforts that section 6 of the Federalism Act of 1999 seeks to encourage.", "Mr. Chairman, this completes my prepared statement.
