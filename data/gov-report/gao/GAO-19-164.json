Specifically, FEMA ensured senior leadership commitment, took steps to assess its business environment and performance goals, took recent actions to track progress in delivering IT requirements, and incorporated input from end user stakeholders. However, FEMA has not yet fully established plans for implementing new business processes or established complete traceability of IT requirements.", "Until FEMA fully implements the remaining two practices, it risks delivering an IT solution that does not fully modernize FEMA's grants management systems.", "While GMM's initial May 2017 cost estimate of about $251 million was generally consistent with leading practices for a reliable, high-quality estimate, it no longer reflects current assumptions about the program. FEMA officials stated in December 2018 that they had completed a revised cost estimate, but it was undergoing departmental approval. GMM's program schedule was inconsistent with leading practices; of particular concern was that the program's final delivery date of September 2020 was not informed by a realistic assessment of GMM development activities, and rather was determined by imposing an unsubstantiated delivery date. Developing sound cost and schedule estimates is necessary to ensure that FEMA has a clear understanding of program risks.", "Of five key cybersecurity practices, FEMA fully addressed three and partially addressed two for GMM. Specifically, it categorized GMM's system based on security risk, selected and implemented security controls, and monitored security controls on an ongoing basis. However, the program had not initially established corrective action plans for 13 medium- and low-risk vulnerabilities. This conflicts with the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) guidance that specifies that corrective action plans must be developed for every weakness identified. Until FEMA, among other things, ensures that the program consistently follows the department's guidance on preparing corrective action plans for all security vulnerabilities, GMM's system will remain at increased risk of exploits."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making eight recommendations to FEMA to implement leading practices related to reengineering processes, managing requirements, scheduling, and implementing cybersecurity.

This has led to poor information  sharing and reporting capabilities, difficulties in reconciling financial data,  and an increased burden on grant recipients.", "In 2008, FEMA attempted to develop and implement a single grants  processing solution, referred to as the Emergency Management Mission  Integrated Environment (EMMIE), to address these IT concerns and  modernize its legacy grants management systems. However, as we have  previously reported, the program experienced significant implementation  challenges, which resulted in a solution that was missing important  capabilities. Subsequently, in 2015, FEMA initiated a new endeavor to  modernize and streamline the agency\u2019s grants management IT  environment. This most recent initiative is referred to as the Grants  Management Modernization (GMM) program.", "Given the importance of having modernized grants management systems  and FEMA\u2019s past system implementation challenges, you asked us to  review the GMM program.

The various laws call for different  administrative and reporting requirements.", "For example, the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency  Assistance Act, as amended, established the statutory authority for 11  of the grant programs, such as the administration of Public Assistance  and Individual Assistance grant programs after a presidentially declared  disaster. The act also requires the FEMA Administrator to submit an  annual report to the President and Congress covering FEMA\u2019s  expenditures, contributions, work, and accomplishments, pursuant to the  act. As another example, the National Dam Safety Program Act  established one of the grant programs aimed at providing financial  assistance to improve dam safety.", "Key stakeholders in modernizing the IT grants management environment  include the internal FEMA officials that review, approve, and monitor the  grants awarded, such as grant specialists, program analysts, and  supervisors.

The use  of an incremental approach is consistent with the Office of Management  and Budget\u2019s guidance as specified in its information technology (IT)  Reform Plan, as well as the legislation commonly referred to as the  Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act.", "Many organizations, especially in the federal government, are  accustomed to using a waterfall software development model, which  typically consists of long, sequential phases, and differs significantly from  the Agile development approach. Agile practices integrate planning,  design, development, and testing into an iterative lifecycle to deliver  software early and often. Figure 7 provides a depiction of software  development using the Agile approach, as compared to a waterfall  approach.", "The frequent iterations of Agile development are intended to effectively  measure progress, reduce technical and programmatic risk, and respond  to feedback from stakeholders in changes to IT requirements more  quickly than traditional methods. Despite these intended benefits,  organizations adopting Agile must overcome challenges in making  significant changes to how they are accustomed to developing software.", "The significant differences between Agile and waterfall development  impact how IT programs are planned, implemented, and monitored in  terms of cost, schedule, and scope. For example, in waterfall  development, significant effort is devoted upfront to document detailed  plans and all IT requirements for the entire scope of work at the beginning  of the program, and cost and schedule can be varied to complete that  work.", "However, for Agile programs the precise details are unknown upfront, so  initial planning of cost, scope, and timing would be conducted at a high  level, and then supplemented with more specific plans for each iteration.  While cost and schedule are set for each iteration, requirements for each  iteration (or increment) can be variable as they are learned over time and  revised to reflect experiences from completed iterations and to  accommodate changing priorities of the end users. The differences in  these two software development approaches are shown in figure 8.", "Looking at figure 8, the benefit provided from using traditional program  management practices such as establishing a cost estimate or a robust  schedule, is not obvious. However, unlike a theoretical environment,  many government programs may not have the autonomy to manage  completely flexible scope, as they must deliver certain minimal  specifications with the cost and schedule provided. In those cases, it is  vital for the team to understand and differentiate the IT requirements that  are \u201cmust haves\u201d from the \u201cnice to haves\u201d early in the planning effort.
