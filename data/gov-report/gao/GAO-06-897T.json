Robust federal security programs are critically important to properly protect this information and the privacy of individuals. GAO was asked to testify on VA's information security program, ways that agencies can prevent improper disclosures of personal information, and issues concerning notifications of privacy breaches. In preparing this testimony, GAO drew on its previous reports and testimonies, as well as on expert opinion provided in congressional testimony and other sources."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["For many years, significant concerns have been raised about VA's information security--particularly its lack of a robust information security program, which is vital to avoiding the compromise of government information, including sensitive personal information. GAO and the department's inspector general have reported recurring weaknesses throughout VA, including the Veterans Benefits Administration, in such areas as access controls, physical security, and segregation of incompatible duties. The department has taken steps to address these weaknesses, but these have not been sufficient to establish a comprehensive information security program. For example, it is still developing plans to complete a security incident response program to monitor suspicious activity and cyber alerts, events, and incidents. Without an established and implemented security program, the department will continue to have major challenges in protecting its information and information systems from security breaches such as the one it recently experienced. In addition to establishing robust security programs, agencies can take a number of actions to help guard against the possibility that databases of personally identifiable information are inadvertently compromised. A key step is to develop a privacy impact assessment--an analysis of how personal information is collected, stored, shared, and managed--whenever information technology is used to process personal information. In addition, agencies can take more specific practical measures aimed at preventing data breaches, including limiting the collection of personal information, limiting the time that such data are retained, limiting access to personal information and training personnel accordingly, and considering the use of technological controls such as encryption when data need to be stored on portable devices. When data breaches do occur, notification of those affected and/or the public has clear benefits, allowing people the opportunity to protect themselves from identity theft. Although existing laws do not require agencies to notify the public of data breaches, such notification is consistent with agencies' responsibility to inform individuals about how their information is being accessed and used, and it promotes accountability for privacy protection. That said, care is needed in defining appropriate criteria for triggering notification. Notices should be coordinated with law enforcement to avoid impeding ongoing investigations, and in order to be effective, notices should be easy to understand. Because of the possible adverse impact of a compromise of personal information, it is critical that people fully understand the threat and their options for addressing it. Strong leadership, sustained management commitment and effort, disciplined processes, and consistent oversight will be needed for VA to address its persistent, long-standing control weaknesses."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for inviting us to participate in today\u2019s hearing on  information security and privacy at the Department of Veterans  Affairs (VA).

In July 2005, we  reported that pervasive weaknesses in the 24 major agencies\u2019  information security policies and practices threatened the integrity,  confidentiality, and availability of federal information and  information systems. As we reported, although federal agencies  showed improvement in addressing information security, they also  continued to have significant control weaknesses that put federal  operations and assets at risk of inadvertent or deliberate misuse,  financial information at risk of unauthorized modification or  destruction, sensitive information at risk of inappropriate  disclosure, and critical operations at risk of disruption. These  weaknesses existed primarily because agencies had not yet fully  implemented strong information security programs, as required by  the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).", "The significance of these weaknesses led us to conclude in the audit  of the federal government\u2019s fiscal year 2005 financial statements  that information security was a material weakness.

Virtually all federal operations are  supported by automated systems and electronic data, without which  agencies would find it difficult, if not impossible, to carry out their  missions and account for their resources. The following examples  show the broad array of federal operations and assets placed at risk  by information security weaknesses:  \u25cf  Resources, such as federal payments and collections, could be lost  or stolen.   \u25cf  Computer resources could be used for unauthorized purposes or to  launch attacks on others.   \u25cf  Personal information, such as taxpayer data, social security records,  and medical records, and proprietary business information could be  inappropriately disclosed, browsed, or copied for purposes of  identity theft, industrial espionage, or other types of crime.   \u25cf  Critical operations, such as those supporting national defense and  emergency services, could be disrupted.   \u25cf  Data could be modified or destroyed for purposes of fraud, theft of  assets, or disruption.  \u25cf  Agency missions could be undermined by embarrassing incidents  that result in diminished confidence in their ability to conduct  operations and fulfill their fiduciary responsibilities.", "The potential disclosure of personal information raise identity theft and privacy concerns. Identity theft generally involves  the fraudulent use of another person\u2019s identifying information\u2014 such as Social Security number, date of birth, or mother\u2019s maiden  name\u2014to establish credit, run up debt, or take over existing  financial accounts. According to identity theft experts, individuals  whose identities have been stolen can spend months or years and  thousands of dollars clearing their names. Some individuals have  lost job opportunities, been refused loans, or even been arrested fo crimes they did not commit as a result of identity theft. The Feder Trade Commission (FTC) reported in 2005 that identity theft  represented about 40 percent of all the consumer fraud complaints  it received during each of the last 3 calendar years.

VA\u2019s networks are highly interconnected, its systems support many  users, and the department has increasingly moved to more  interactive, Web-based services to better meet the needs of its  customers. Effectively securing these computer systems and  networks is critical to the department\u2019s ability to safeguard its  assets, maintain the confidentiality of sensitive veterans\u2019 health and  disability benefits information, and ensure the integrity of its  financial data.", "In this complex IT environment, VA has faced long-standing  challenges in achieving effective information security across the  department. Our reviews identified wide-ranging, often recurring  deficiencies in the department\u2019s information security controls  (attachment 2 provides further detail on our reports and the areas of  weakness they discuss). Examples of areas of deficiency include the  following.   \u25cf  Access authority was not appropriately controlled. A basic  management objective for any organization is to protect the  resources that support its critical operations from unauthorized  access. Electronic access controls are intended to prevent, limit,  and detect unauthorized access to computing resources, programs,  and information and include controls related to user accounts and  passwords, user rights and file permissions, logging and monitoring  of security-relevant events, and network management. Inadequate  controls diminish the reliability of computerized information and  increase the risk of unauthorized disclosure, modification, and  destruction of sensitive information and disruption of service.", "However, VA had not established effective electronic access  controls to prevent individuals from gaining unauthorized access to  its systems and sensitive data, as the following examples illustrate:  \u25cf  User accounts and passwords: In 1998, many user accounts at  four VA medical centers and data centers had weaknesses  including passwords that could be easily guessed, null  passwords, and passwords that were set to never expire. We also  found numerous instances where medical and data center staff  members were sharing user IDs and passwords.  \u25cf  User rights and permissions: We reported in 2000 that three VA  health care systems were not ensuring that user accounts with  broad access to financial and sensitive veteran information had  proper authorization for such access, and were not reviewing  these accounts to determine if their level of access remained  appropriate.   \u25cf  Logging and monitoring of security-related events: In 1998, VA  did not have any departmentwide guidance for monitoring both  successful and unsuccessful attempts to access system files  containing key financial information or sensitive veteran data,  and none of the medical and data centers we visited were  actively monitoring network access activity. In 1999, we found  that one data center was monitoring failed access attempts, but  was not monitoring successful accesses to sensitive data and  resources for unusual or suspicious activity.   \u25cf  Network management: In 2000, we reported that one of the  health care systems we visited had not configured a network  parameter to effectively prevent unauthorized access to a  network system; this same health care system had also failed to  keep its network system software up to date.  \u25cf  Physical security controls were inadequate. Physical security  controls are important for protecting computer facilities and  resources from espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft. These  controls restrict physical access to computer resources, usually by  limiting access to the buildings and rooms in which the resources  are housed and by periodically reviewing the access granted, in  order to ensure that access continues to be appropriate. VA had  weaknesses in the physical security for its computer facilities. For  example, in our 1998 and 2000 reports, we stated that none of the VA  facilities we visited were adequately controlling access to their  computer rooms. In addition, in 1998 we reported that sensitive  equipment at two facilities was not adequately protected, increas the risk of disruption to computer operations or network  communications.  \u25cf  mployees were not prevented from performing incompatible  E duties. Segregation of duties refers to the policies, procedures, a organizational structures that help ensure that one individual cannot independently control all key aspects of a process or computer- related operation. Dividing duties among two or more individual organizational groups diminishes the likelihood that errors and s or  wrongful acts will go undetected, because the activities of one  individual or group will serve as a check on the activities of the  other. We determined that VA did not assign employee duties an d  responsibilities in a manner that segregated incompatible function among individuals or groups of individuals. For example, in 1998 we s  reported that some system programmers also had security  administrator privileges, giving them the ability to eliminate  any  evidence of their activity in the system. In 2000, we reported thattwo VA health care systems allowed some employees to request,  approve, and receive medical items without management approva l,  violating both basic segregation of duties principles and VA policy;  in addition, no mitigating controls were found to alert management  of purchases made in this manner.", "S oftware change control procedures were not consistently  implemented. It is important to ensure that only authorized  tested systems are placed in operation. To ensure that changes to  systems are necessary, work as intended, and do not result in the  loss of data or program integrity, such changes should be  documented, authorized, tested, and independently review ed. We  found that VA did not adequately control changes to its operating  systems. For example, in 1998 we reported that one VA data centerhad not established detailed written procedures or formal guidance  for modifying operating system software, for approving and testing  operating system software changes, or for implementing these  changes. The data center had made more than 100 system softw changes during fiscal year 1997, but none of the changes included  evidence of testing, independent review, or acceptance. We reporte d  in 2000 that two VA health care systems had not established  procedures for periodically reviewing changes to standard  application programs to ensure that only authorized program was implemented.  ervice continuity planning was not complete. In addition to  S protecting data and programs from misuse, organizations must  ensure that they are adequately prepared to cope with a loss of  operational capability due to earthquakes, fires, accidents, sabo or any other disruption. An essential element in preparing for such  catastrophes is an up-to-date, detailed, and fully tested service  continuity plan. Such a plan is critical for helping to ensure thatinformation system operations and data can be promptly restore the event of a disaster. We reported that VA had not completed or  tested service continuity plans for several systems. For example, in1998 we reported that one VA data center had 17 individual disaster  recovery plans covering various segments of the organization, but it  did not have an overall document that integrated the 17 separate  plans and defined the roles and responsibilities for the disaster  recovery teams. In 2000, we determined that the service continu plans for two of the three health care systems we visited did not  include critical elements such as detailed recovery procedures,  provisions for restoring mission-critical systems, and a list of key contacts; in addition, none of the health care systems we visited  were fully testing their service continuity plans.  hese deficiencies existed, in part, because VA had not implemented  T key components of a comprehensive computer security program.  Specifically, VA\u2019s computer security efforts lacked   \u25cf  clearly delineated security roles and responsibilities;  \u25cf  regular, periodic assessments of risk;  \u25cf  security policies and procedures that a VA\u2019s interconnected environment;  an ongoing security monitoring pro investigate unauthorized, unusual, or suspicious access a and  ctivity;  \u25cf  a process to measure, test, and report on the continued  effectiveness of computer system, network, and process controls.", "As a result, we made a number of recommendations in 2002 that  were aimed at improving VA\u2019s security management. Among the  primary elements of these recommendations were that (1) VA  centralize its security management functions and (2) it perform  other actions to establish an information security program,  including actions related to risk assessments, security policies and  procedures, security awareness, and monitoring and evaluating  computer controls."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA\u2019s Efforts to Address Information Security Weaknesses Have Been Limited", "paragraphs": ["The department has taken steps to address the weaknesses that we  described, but these have not been sufficient to fully implement a  comprehensive information security program. Examples of actions  that VA has taken and still needs to take include the following:   \u25cf  Central security management function: The department realigned  its information technology resources to place administration and  field office security functions more directly under the oversight of  the department\u2019s CIO, consolidating all administration-level cyber  security functions under the department\u2019s cyber security office. In  addition, to provide greater management accountability for  information security, the Secretary instituted information security  standards for members of the department\u2019s senior executive service.  The cyber security officer organized his office to focus more directly  on critical elements of information security control, and he updated  the department\u2019s security management plan and information  security policies and procedures. However, the department still  needed to develop policy and guidance to ensure (1) authority and  independence for security officers and (2) departmentwide  coordination of security functions.  \u25cf  Periodic risk assessments: VA is implementing a commercial tool to  identify the level of risk associated with system changes and also to  conduct information security risk assessments. It also created a  methodology that establishes minimum requirements for such risk  assessments. However, it has not yet completed its risk assessment  policy and guidance. VA reported that such guidance was  forthcoming as part of an overarching information system security  certification and accreditation policy that was to be developed  during 2006. Without these elements, VA cannot be assured that it is  appropriately performing risk assessments departmentwide.  \u25cf  Security policies and procedures: VA\u2019s cyber security officer  reported that VA has action ongoing to develop a process for  collecting and tracking performance data, ensuring management  action when needed, and providing independent validation of  reported issues. VA also has ongoing efforts in the area of detecting,  reporting, and responding to security incidents. For example, it  established network intrusion prevention capability at its four  enterprise gateways. It is also developing strategic and tactical plans  to complete a security incident response program to monitor  suspicious activity and cyber alerts, events, and incidents. However,  these plans are not complete.   \u25cf  Security awareness: VA has taken steps to improve security  awareness training. It holds an annual department information  security conference, and it has developed a Web portal for security  training, policy, and procedures, as well as a security awareness  course that VA employees are required to review annually. However,  VA has not demonstrated that it has a process to ensure compliance.  \u25cf  Monitoring and evaluating computer controls: VA established a  process to better monitor and evaluate computer controls by  tracking the status of security weaknesses, corrective actions taken,  and independent validations of corrective actions through a  software data base.

Several that may be of particular  value in preventing inadvertent data breaches include the following:  Limit collection of personal information. One item to be analyzed  as part of a PIA is the extent to which an agency needs to collect  personal information in order to meet the requirements of a specific  application. Limiting the collection of personal information, among  other things, serves to limit the opportunity for that information to  be compromised. For example, key identifying information\u2014such as  Social Security numbers\u2014may not be needed for many agency  applications that have databases of other personal information.  Limiting the collection of personal information is also one of the fair  information practices, which are fundamental to the Privacy Act and  to good privacy practice in general.", "Limit data retention. Closely related to limiting data collection is  limiting retention. Retaining personal data longer than needed by an  agency or statutorily required adds to the risk that the data will be  compromised. In discussing data retention, California\u2019s Office of  Privacy Protection recently reported an example in which a  university experienced a security breach that exposed 15-year-old  data, including Social Security numbers. The university  subsequently reviewed its policies and decided to shorten the  retention period for certain types of information. As part of their  PIAs, federal agencies can make decisions up front about how long  they plan to retain personal data, aiming to retain the data for as  brief a period as necessary.", "Limit access to personal information and train personnel  accordingly. Only individuals with a need to access agency  databases of personal information should have such access, and  controls should be in place to monitor that access. Further, agencies  can implement technological controls to prevent personal data from  being readily transferred to unauthorized systems or media, such as  laptop computers, discs, or other electronic storage devices.  Security training, which is required for all federal employees under  FISMA, can include training on the risks of exposing personal data  to potential identity theft, thus helping to reduce the likelihood of  data being exposed inadvertently.", "Consider using technological controls such as encryption when  data need to be stored on portable devices. In certain instances,  agencies may find it necessary to enable employees to have access  to personal data on portable devices such as laptop computers. As  discussed, this should be minimized. However, when absolutely  necessary, the risk that such data could be exposed to unauthorized  individuals can be reduced by using technological controls such as  encryption, which significantly limits the ability of such individuals  to gain access to the data. Although encrypting data adds to the  operational burden on authorized individuals, who must enter pass  codes or use other authentication means to convert the data into  readable text, it can provide reasonable assurance that stolen or lost  computer equipment will not result in personal data being  compromised, as occurred in the recent incident at VA. A decision  about whether to use encryption would logically be made as an  element of the PIA process and an agency\u2019s broader information  security program.", "While these suggestions do not amount to a complete prescription  for protecting personal data, they are key elements of an agency\u2019s  strategy for reducing the risks that could lead to identity theft."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Public Notification of Data Breaches Has Clear Benefits as Well as Challenges", "paragraphs": ["In the event a data breach does occur, agencies must respond  quickly in order to minimize the potential harm associated with  identity theft. The chairman of the Federal Trade Commission has  testified that the Commission believes that if a security breach  creates a significant risk of identity theft or other related harm,  affected consumers should be notified. The Federal Trade  Commission has also reported that the overall cost of an incident of  identity theft, as well as the harm to the victims, is significantly  smaller if the misuse of the victim\u2019s personal information is  discovered quickly.", "Applicable laws such as the Privacy Act currently do not require  agencies to notify individuals of security breaches involving their  personal information; however, doing so allows those affected the  opportunity to take steps to protect themselves against the dangers  of identity theft. For example, California\u2019s data breach notification  law is credited with bringing to the public\u2019s notice large data  breaches within the private sector, such as those involving  ChoicePoint and LexisNexis last year. Arguably, the California law  may have mitigated the risk of identity theft to affected individuals  by keeping them informed about data breaches and thus enabling  them to take steps such as contacting credit bureaus to have fraud  alerts placed on their credit files, obtaining copies of their credit  reports, scrutinizing their monthly financial account statements, and  taking other steps to protect themselves.", "Breach notification is also important in that it can help an  organization address key privacy rights of individuals, in accordance  with the fair information practices mentioned earlier. Breach  notification is one way that organizations\u2014either in the private  sector or the government\u2014can follow the openness principle and  meet their responsibility for keeping the public informed of how  their personal information is being used and who has access to it.  Equally important, notification is consistent with the principle that  those controlling the collection or use of personal information  should be accountable for taking steps to ensure the implementation  of the other principles, such as use limitation and security  safeguards. Public disclosure of data breaches is a key step in  ensuring that organizations are held accountable for the protection  of personal information."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Concerns Have Been Raised About the Criteria for Issuing Notices to the Public", "paragraphs": ["Although the principle of notifying affected individuals (or the  public) about data breaches has clear benefits, determining the  specifics of when and how an agency should issue such notifications  presents challenges, particularly in determining the specific criteria  for incidents that merit notification. In congressional testimony, the  Federal Trade Commission raised concerns about the threshold at  which consumers should be notified of a breach, cautioning that too  strict a standard could have several negative effects. First,  notification of a breach when there is little or no risk of harm might  create unnecessary concern and confusion. Second, a surfeit of  notices, resulting from notification criteria that are too strict, could  render all such notices less effective, because consumers could  become numb to them and fail to act when risks are truly  significant. Finally, the costs to both individuals and business are  not insignificant and may be worth considering. FTC points out that,  in response to a security breach notification, a consumer may cancel  credit cards, contact credit bureaus to place fraud alerts on credit  files, or obtain a new driver\u2019s license number. These actions could  be time-consuming for the individual and costly for the companies  involved. Given these potential negative effects, care is clearly  needed in defining appropriate criteria for required breach  notifications.", "While care needs to be taken to avoid requiring agencies to notify  the public of trivial security incidents, concerns have also been  raised about setting criteria that are too open-ended or that rely too  heavily on the discretion of the affected organization. Some public  advocacy groups have cautioned that notification criteria that are  too weak would give companies an incentive not to disclose  potentially harmful breaches, and the same concern would apply to  federal agencies. In congressional testimony last year, the executive  director of the Center for Democracy and Technology argued that if  an entity is not certain whether a breach warrants notification, it  should be able to consult with the Federal Trade Commission. He  went on to suggest that a two-tiered system may be desirable, with  notice to the Federal Trade Commission of all breaches of personal  data and notice to consumers where there is a potential risk of  identity theft. The Center for Democracy and Technology\u2019s  comments regarding the Federal Trade Commission were aimed at  commercial entities such as information resellers. A different  entity\u2014such as OMB, which is responsible for overseeing security  and privacy within the federal government\u2014might be more  appropriate to take on a parallel role with respect to federal  agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effective Notices Should Provide Useful Information and Be Easy to Understand", "paragraphs": ["Once a determination has been made that a public notice is to be  issued, care must be taken to ensure that it does its job effectively.  Designing useful, easy-to-understand notices has been cited as a  challenge in other areas where privacy notices are required by law,  such as in the financial industry\u2014where businesses are required by  the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to send notices to consumers about  their privacy practices\u2014and in the federal government, which is  required by the Privacy Act to issue public notices in the Federal  Register about its systems of records containing personal  information. For example, as noted during a public workshop  hosted by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Privacy Office,  designing easy-to-understand consumer financial privacy notices to  meet Gramm-Leach Bliley Act requirements has been challenging.  Officials from the FTC and Office of the Comptroller of the  Currency described widespread criticism of these notices\u2014that they  were unexpected, too long, filled with legalese, and not  understandable.", "If an agency is to notify people of a data breach, it should do so in  such a way that they understand the nature of the threat and what  steps need to be taken to protect themselves against identity theft.  In connection with its state law requiring security breach  notifications, the California Office of Privacy Protection has  published recommended practices for designing and issuing security  breach notices. The office recommends that such notifications  include, among other things,  \u25cf  a general description of what happened;  \u25cf  the type of personal information that was involved;  \u25cf  what steps have been taken to prevent further unauthorized  acquisition of personal information;  \u25cf  the types of assistance to be provided to individuals, such as a toll- free contact telephone number for additional information and  assistance;  information on what individuals can do to protect themselves from  identity theft, including contact information for the three credit  reporting agencies; and  information on where individuals can obtain additional information  on protection against identity theft, such as the Federal Trade  Commission\u2019s Identity Theft Web site (www.consumer.gov/idtheft).", "The California Office of Privacy Protection also recommends  making notices clear, conspicuous, and helpful by using clear,  simple language and avoiding jargon, and it suggests avoiding using  a standardized format to mitigate the risk that the public will  become complacent about the process.", "The Federal Trade Commission has issued guidance to businesses  on notifying individuals of data breaches that reiterates several key  elements of effective notification\u2014describing clearly what is known  about the data compromise, explaining what responses may be  appropriate for the type of information taken, and providing  information and contacts regarding identity theft in general. The  Commission also suggests providing contact information for the law  enforcement officer working on the case, as well as encouraging  individuals who discover that their information has been misused to  file a complaint with the Commission.", "Both the state of California and the Federal Trade Commission  recommend consulting with cognizant law-enforcement officers  about an incident before issuing notices to the public. In some  cases, early notification or disclosure of certain facts about an  incident could hamper a law enforcement investigation. For  example, an otherwise unknowing thief could learn of the potential  value of data stored on a laptop computer that was originally stolen  purely for the value of the hardware. Thus it is recommended that  organizations consult with law enforcement regarding the timing  and content of notifications. However, law enforcement  investigations should not necessarily result in lengthy delays in  notification. California\u2019s guidance states that it should not be  necessary for a law enforcement agency to complete an  investigation before notification can be given.", "When providing notifications to the public, organizations should  consider how to ensure that these are easily understood. Various  techniques have been suggested to promote comprehension,  including the concept of \u201clayering.\u201d Layering involves providing  only the most important summary facts up front\u2014often in a  graphical format\u2014followed by one or more lengthier, more  narrative versions in order to ensure that all information is  communicated that needs to be. Multilayering may be an option to  achieving an easy-to-understand notice that is still complete.  Similarly, providing context to the notice (explaining to consumers  why they are receiving the notice and what to do with it) has been  found to promote comprehension, as did visual design elements  such as a tabular format, large and legible fonts, appropriate white  space, and simple headings.", "Although these techniques were developed for other kinds of  notices, they can be applied to those informing the public of data  breaches. For example, a multilayered security breach notice could  include a brief description of the nature of the security breach, the  potential threat to victims of the incident, and measures to be taken  to protect against identity theft. The notice could provide additional  details about the incident as an attachment or by providing links to  additional information. This would accomplish the purpose of  communicating the key details in a brief format, while still providing  complete information to those who require it. Given that people may  be adversely affected by a compromise of their personal  information, it is critical that they fully understand the nature of the  threat and the options they have to address it.", "In summary, the recent security breach at VA has highlighted the  importance of implementing effective information security  practices. Long-standing information security control weaknesses at  VA have placed its information systems and information, including  personally identifiable information, at increased risk of misuse and  unauthorized disclosure. Although VA has taken steps to mitigate  previously reported weaknesses, it has not implemented a  comprehensive, integrated information security program, which it  needs in order to effectively manage risks on an ongoing basis.  Much work remains to be done. Only through strong leadership,  sustained management commitment and effort, disciplined  processes, and consistent oversight can VA address its persistent,  long-standing control weaknesses.", "To reduce the likelihood of experiencing such breaches, agencies  can take a number of actions that can help guard against the  possibility that databases of personally identifiable information are  inadvertently compromised: strategically, they should ensure that a  robust information security program is in place and that PIAs are  developed. More specific practical measures aimed at preventing  inadvertent data breaches include limiting the collection of personal  information, limiting data retention, limiting access to personal  information and training personnel accordingly, and considering  using technological controls such as encryption when data need to  be stored on mobile devices.", "Nevertheless, data breaches can still occur at any time, and when  they do, notification to the individuals affected and/or the public has  clear benefits, allowing people the opportunity to take steps to  protect themselves against the dangers of identity theft. Care is  needed in defining appropriate criteria if agencies are to be required  to report security breaches to the public. Further, care is also  needed to ensure that notices are useful and easy to understand, so  that they are effective in alerting individuals to actions they may  want to take to minimize the risk of identity theft.", "We have previously testified that as Congress considers legislation  requiring agencies to notify individuals or the public about security  breaches, it should ensure that specific criteria are defined for  incidents that merit public notification. It may want to consider  creating a two-tier reporting requirement, in which all security  breaches are reported to OMB, and affected individuals are notified  only of incidents involving significant risk. Further, Congress should  consider requiring OMB to provide guidance to agencies on how to  develop and issue security breach notices to the public.", "Messers.
