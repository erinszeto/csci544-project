For example, these officials told GAO that there are no established minimum thresholds for IA, making final determinations more subjective and the rationale behind denials unclear. However, as required by the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, FEMA has taken steps to revise the IA factors by issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking. According to FEMA, the proposed rule aims to provide more objective criteria, clarify the threshold for eligibility, and speed up the IA declaration process. As of April 2018, the proposed rule was still under consideration.

As a result of  these disasters, 4.7 million individuals applied for assistance in 2017 from  the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) through its  Individual Assistance (IA) program, which provides help to individuals and  families to meet their immediate needs, shelter, and medical needs in the  wake of a disaster. FEMA provided more than $2 billion in IA funds in  response to these disasters. FEMA is a component of the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) that leads the federal effort to prepare, respond  to, and help recover from disasters, both natural and man-made.  Following a major disaster declaration by the President, FEMA may  provide three principal forms of assistance. These include IA; Public  Assistance, which addresses repairs to communities\u2019 and states\u2019  infrastructure; and Hazard Mitigation Assistance, which provides funding  for projects a state submits to reduce the threat of future damage.", "To obtain federal disaster assistance, a state or tribe must request a  disaster declaration through FEMA (IA declaration), and then FEMA  determines whether to make a recommendation to the President to  declare a major disaster. In reviewing the state or tribe\u2019s IA disaster  declaration request, FEMA is to consider six primary factors, established  in regulation in 1999, to determine the severity, magnitude, and impact of  a disaster event. These IA regulatory factors include: (1) concentration of  damages (e.g., homes destroyed); (2) trauma (e.g., injuries and death);  (3) special populations (e.g., elderly and disabled); (4) voluntary agency  assistance; (5) insurance coverage; and (6) average amount of individual  assistance by state. After Hurricane Sandy, Congress passed the Sandy  Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 to improve certain aspects of disaster  assistance, and the act directed FEMA to review, update, and revise the  IA factors in order to provide more objective criteria, clarify the threshold  for eligibility, and speed the IA declaration process.", "You asked us to review the IA declaration process and regulatory factors  along with FEMA\u2019s proposed changes to the factors.

We excluded emergency and expedited disaster declaration  requests because such requests are not required to include all the  information related to the regulatory factors. We did not include RVARs  prepared prior to July 2012, after FEMA updated its RVAR guidance and  training and began recommending the use of a new RVAR template in  order to help ensure consistency across regions. We also obtained a  copy of the RVAR template, which we determined contained 28 elements,  most of which pertain to the six IA factors identified in the regulation. We  used these elements to analyze the 81 RVARs to determine if information  on the IA regulatory factors were obtained and documented. We  interviewed officials from FEMA headquarters and all 10 FEMA regions  on their consideration of the IA regulatory factors and development of the  RVARs. We also compared the 81 RVARs to Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government.

We selected the 11 states  based on those that have undergone multiple IA requests from calendar  years 2008 through 2016 and those that have experienced various types  of disasters in different regions of the country. We selected California,  Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, Ohio,  Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Virginia.

Once a disaster is declared,  FEMA provides assistance through the IA, Public Assistance, and Hazard  Mitigation Assistance programs. For instance, some declarations may  provide grants only for IA and others only for Public Assistance.

The regulation states that  FEMA considers the six factors not only to evaluate the need for IA but  also to measure the severity, magnitude, and impact of the disaster. The  state or tribe provides information on these factors when submitting its  disaster declaration request. The six factors for IA include the following:  1.  Concentration of Damages\u2014characterizes the density of the  damage in individual communities. The regulation states that highly  concentrated damages \u201cgenerally indicate a greater need for federal  assistance than widespread and scattered damages throughout a  state.\u201d For example, concentration of damage data includes the  numbers of homes destroyed, homes with major or minor damages,  and homes affected.  2.  Trauma\u2014the regulation provides conditions that might cause trauma  including large numbers of injuries and deaths, large-scale disruption  of normal community functions, and emergency needs such as  extended loss of power or water.  3.  Special Populations\u2014FEMA considers the impact of the disaster on  special populations, such as low-income populations, the elderly, or  the unemployed.  4.  Voluntary Agency Assistance\u2014involves the availability and  capabilities of voluntary, faith, and community-based organizations,  and state and local programs to help meet both the emergency and  recovery needs of individuals affected by disasters.  5.  Insurance Coverage\u2014addresses the level of insurance coverage  among those affected by disasters. Because disaster assistance  cannot duplicate insurance coverage, as recognized in the regulation,  if a disaster occurred where almost all of the damaged dwellings were  fully insured for the damage that was sustained, FEMA could  conclude that a disaster declaration by the President was not  necessary in accordance with this factor.  6.  Average Amount of Individual Assistance by State\u2014according to  the regulation, there is no set threshold for recommending IA.  However, it states that the averages, depicted in table 1, may prove  useful to states and voluntary agencies as they develop plans and  programs to meet the needs of disaster victims. The inference is that  these averages generally indicate the amount of damages that could  be expected for a state based on its size (small, medium, and large).  The averages contained within the regulation and depicted in table 1  are based on disasters that occurred between July of 1994 and July of  1999."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The President Declared 57 Percent of All IA Requests from 2008 through 2016, with Total Obligations of Approximately $8.6 Billion", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Number of IA Declarations Varied by Region and Severe Storms Were the Most Frequent Disaster Type", "paragraphs": ["The President declared 57 percent of all IA declaration requests from  calendars years 2008 through 2016, with total IA obligations of  approximately $8.6 billion.

Additionally, two states said  unemployment related to a disaster incident for the disaster-related  unemployment factor would be hard to quantify in the first 30 days  following a disaster. They stated that this was especially an issue given  that states work to submit an IA disaster declaration request as soon as  possible following a disaster.", "According to the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s Office of  Information and Regulatory Affairs website, the projected date for  finalization of the proposed rule is September 2018; however, as of April  2018, FEMA officials stated that they were not certain whether that  timeframe would be met.

Because it is unclear why regions are not always documenting all of the  elements related to these factors, evaluating the reasons why could help  FEMA identify if any corrective steps are needed.
