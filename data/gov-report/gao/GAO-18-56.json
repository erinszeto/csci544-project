The purpose statute requires that amounts designated in appropriations acts for specific purposes are used as designated. The Forest Service did not have an adequate process and related control activities to reasonably assure that amounts were used as designated. In fiscal year 2017, GAO issued a legal opinion that the Forest Service had failed to comply with the purpose statute with regard to a $65 million line-item appropriation specifically provided for the purpose of acquiring aircraft for the next-generation airtanker fleet. Further, the Forest Service lacked a process and related control activities to reasonably assure that unobligated no-year appropriation balances from prior years were reviewed for their continuing need; did not have a properly designed system for administrative control of funds, which keeps obligations and expenditures from exceeding limits authorized by law; and had not properly designed control activities for fund transfers to its Wildland Fire Management program. These deficiencies increase the risk that the Forest Service may make budget requests in excess of its needs.", "Reimbursable agreements . To carry out its mission, the Forest Service enters into reimbursable agreements with agencies within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), other federal agencies, state and local government agencies, and nongovernment entities. The Forest Service (1) did not have adequately described processes and related control activities in manuals and handbooks for its reimbursable agreement processes and (2) lacked control activities related to segregating incompatible duties performed by line officers and program managers. For example, line officers may be responsible for initiating cost sharing agreements, modifying cost settlement packages, and changing or canceling the related receivable, which represent incompatible duties. As a result, programs and resources may not be protected from waste, fraud, and mismanagement.", "Unliquidated obligations . The Forest Service's processes and control activities over the review and certification of unliquidated obligations were not properly designed to reasonably assure the best use of funds and that unliquidated obligations would be efficiently and effectively deobligated and made available for other program needs. Further, the current process, as designed, was inconsistent with USDA and Forest Service policy.", "In addition, the Forest Service's manuals and handbooks, which provide directives for the areas that GAO reviewed, had not been reviewed by management in accordance with the Forest Service's 5-year review policy.

According to  USDA\u2019s Office of General Counsel, \u201cthis lack of any separate  apportionment or account for the next-generation airtanker fleet was due to the fact that it was a new item, not included in the agency\u2019s budget  request, and added late in the appropriations process.\u201d Similarly, in fiscal  year 2016, the Forest Service did not create new budget line items to  reserve in its financial system $75 million for the Forest Inventory and  Analysis Program specified in the fiscal year 2016 appropriations act.

Based on our review of  documentation that the Forest Service provided for four fire incidents, we  found that for these incidents the Cost Settlement Packages and the  billings took several months to years to complete after the fire incident.  According to Forest Service officials, delays in preparing the Cost  Settlement Package in many cases were due to parties involved in  suppressing the fires taking a long time to submit their invoices to the  Forest Service for payment. Because the preparation of Cost Settlement Packages was not included in the process documents, the Forest Service  did not have a defined time frame for when, in relation to the end of the  fire, the Cost Settlement Package must be completed. For example, in  one case we reviewed, the bill for a cost settlement was sent 9 months  after the fire occurred, and in another case, settlement occurred  approximately 2 years after the fire occurred.

The manuals and  handbooks related to RACAs state that a manager review the  documentation to ensure that the funding supports the objective of the  agreement, the agreement is the correct instrument for funding the  project, all relevant terms and conditions have been included in the  agreement, the entity\u2019s financial strength and capability are acceptable,  and all applicable regulations and OMB circulars have been addressed.  However, there was no discussion in the manuals and handbooks about  when the manager needs to perform the reviews and how these reviews  were to be documented. Further, in response to our inquiry regarding  procedures performed to assess the entity\u2019s financial strength and  capability are acceptable before a RACA is signed, Forest Service  officials stated that there is currently no formal process for determining  financial capability for RACAs. For reimbursable agreements, the Forest  Service\u2019s process documented in its handbook consisted of completing a  creditworthiness checklist. However, the handbook did not describe  procedures for (1) completing the checklist and (2) documenting  responsible personnel\u2019s review and approval of an entity\u2019s acceptable  financial capability.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  management should design control activities to achieve objectives and  respond to risks.

Further, the manuals and handbooks for the RACA processes had  no indication that they had been reviewed within the past 5 years. Forest  Service policy requires routine review, every 5 years, of policies and  procedures in its Directive System. According to Forest Service officials,  a staff member from ORMS sends an e-mail to officials responsible for  updating these policies and procedures. However, appropriate control  activities have not been designed to reasonably assure that updates were  made, reviewed, approved, and issued as needed for continued  relevance and effectiveness.", "Without adequate descriptions of processes and related control activities  in its manuals and handbooks over RACAs, the Forest Service is at risk  that processes and related control activities may not be properly,  consistently, and timely performed.

The Forest Service line officer for fire  incident cooperative agreements and program managers for RACA at the  RSA, unit, or field levels initiate and develop the terms of the agreements  and are also responsible for any subsequent negotiation of the  agreements. In the process of negotiating and settling costs, the line  officer or program manager has the authority to cancel or change related  receivables that they deemed uncollectible. For example, in a fire  incident, the line officer at the region or field level is involved in both  developing a Cost Share Agreement and after the fire incident has ended,  negotiating the Cost Settlement Package with parties involved in the  agreement to determine the final settlement amount that the Forest  Service will be reimbursed for expenses paid in suppressing the fire  incident. Therefore, the line officer is responsible for initiating the Cost  Share Agreement, modifying the Cost Settlement Package, and changing  or canceling the related receivable, which represent conflicting duties.

Once a  determination has been made that an unliquidated obligation can be  deobligated, program or procurement personnel are to notify finance  personnel, in writing, within 5 days of the determination to process the  deobligation.
