VA maintains six information systems that include partial data related to employee misconduct. For example, VA's Personnel and Accounting Integrated Data system collects information on disciplinary actions that affect employee leave and pay, but the system does not collect information on other types of disciplinary actions. The system also does not collect information such as the offense or date of occurrence. GAO also identified six other information systems that various VA administrations and program offices use to collect specific information regarding their respective employees' misconduct and disciplinary actions. GAO's analysis of all 12 information systems found data-reliability issues\u2014such as missing data, lack of identifiers, and lack of standardization among fields. Without collecting reliable misconduct and disciplinary action data on all cases department-wide, VA's reporting and decision making on misconduct are impaired.", "VA inconsistently adhered to its guidance for documentation retention when adjudicating misconduct allegations, based on GAO's review of a generalizable sample of 544 out of 23,622 misconduct case files associated with employee disciplinary actions affecting employee pay. GAO estimates that VA would not be able to account for approximately 1,800 case files. Further, GAO estimates that approximately 3,600 of the files did not contain required documentation that employees were adequately informed of their rights during adjudication procedures\u2014such as their entitlement to be represented by an attorney. The absence of files and associated documentation suggests that individuals may not have always received fair and reasonable due process as allegations of misconduct were adjudicated. Nevertheless, VA's Office of Human Resource Management does not regularly assess the extent to which files and documentation are retained consistently with applicable requirements.", "VA did not consistently ensure that allegations of misconduct involving senior officials were reviewed according to investigative standards and these officials were held accountable. For example, based on a review of 23 cases of alleged misconduct by senior officials that the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) referred to VA facility and program offices for additional investigation, GAO found VA frequently did not include sufficient documentation for its findings, or provide a timely response to the OIG. In addition, VA was unable to produce any documentation used to close 2 cases. Further, OIG policy does not require the OIG to verify the completeness of investigations, which would help ensure that facility and program offices had met the requirements for investigating allegations of misconduct. Regarding senior officials, VA did not always take necessary measures to ensure they were held accountable for substantiated misconduct. As the figure below shows, GAO found that the disciplinary action proposed was not taken for 5 of 17 senior officials with substantiated misconduct.", "As a result of June 2017 legislation, a new office within VA\u2014the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection\u2014will be responsible for receiving and investigating allegations of misconduct involving senior officials.", "VA has procedures for investigating whistle-blower complaints, but the procedures allow the program office or facility where a whistle-blower has reported misconduct to conduct the investigation. According to the OIG, it has the option of investigating allegations of misconduct, or exercising a \u201cright of first refusal\u201d whereby it refers allegations of misconduct to the VA facility or program office where the allegation originated. VA does not have oversight measures to ensure that all referred allegations of misconduct are investigated by an entity outside the control of the facility or program office involved in the misconduct, to ensure independence. As a result, GAO found instances where managers investigated themselves for misconduct, presenting a conflict of interest.", "Data and whistle-blower testimony indicate that retaliation may have occurred at VA. As the table below shows, individuals who filed a disclosure of misconduct with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) received disciplinary action at a much higher rate than the peer average for the rest of VA in fiscal years 2010\u20132014.", "Additionally, GAO's interviews with six VA whistle-blowers who claim to have been retaliated against provided anecdotal evidence that retaliation may be occurring.

The absence of documentation in some files also raises the  possibility that VA may not always be in compliance with its procedures  for governing the adjudication of alleged employee misconduct.  Additionally, ensuring that human-resources personnel adequately inform  employees of their rights during the adjudication process would provide  them with a reasonable opportunity to present their case when preparing  their defense.

When  disciplinary actions are taken, in response to findings of misconduct, but  are not entered within an appropriate information system, or are  inaccurately recorded, it is more difficult to monitor whether disciplinary  actions have been implemented in substantiated instances of misconduct  involving senior officials. As demonstrated, this may result in no action  being taken for substantiated misconduct or the previous penalties not  having the corrective effect for repeat offenders. There is also an  increased risk that substantiated misconduct will go unaddressed if there  is no recommendation for corrective action.

VA stated that it will provide whistle-blower training to all  employees on a biennial basis, which will include the reporting lines for  disclosures of wrongdoing, the manner in which disclosures flow once  they are made, how information is shared among the whistle-blower  entities, and what protections exists for those who disclose wrongdoing.", "Regarding our recommendations to the Inspector General, the OIG  partially concurred with our sixth recommendation, to revise its policy to  include a requirement to verify whether evidence produced in senior- official case referrals demonstrates that the six elements required in VA  Directive 0701 have been addressed. The OIG indicated that VA Directive  0701 is currently being updated to require a written or electronic signature  from the person preparing the responses as an attestation that the  specific requirements of the directive were met. The OIG also indicated in  its letter that the OIG\u2019s Hotline staff carefully review the case response  but Hotline staff are not required to request an updated response from VA  to address matters not necessary to the resolution to the referral. The  OIG asserted that requesting an update would detract from the resources  for other important VA activities. On page 4 of the OIG\u2019s letter, the OIG  states that Hotline analysts are allowed to exercise some discretion in  accepting responses that may include minor departures from the six  elements.", "We continue to believe that, in order to have a complete response to a  referral, all six elements required by the directive should be addressed. In  addition, Directive 0701 does not allow for the use of professional  judgement to decide which elements to include or not to include in a  response. While we agree that requiring a written or electronic signature  from the person preparing the responses as an attestation will help  ensure that the specific requirements of the directive were met, we  maintain that not requiring Hotline analysts to review responses to ensure  that all elements of the directive are addressed is inconsistent with the  intent of the directive.", "In its response to our 13th recommendation, that the OIG develop a  process to ensure that an OSC case number is linked to the investigative  case number and the final report, the OIG concurred. It stated that it will  engage with the Executive Director of OAWP to develop a process to  ensure that OSC case numbers are linked to OIG and OAWP  investigative case numbers, as appropriate, and linked to any final report  of investigation.", "In addition to its response to recommendations, the VA OIG also raised a  number of concerns with our findings. Page 1 of its letter summarizes  some of these concerns and then provides more detail on each concern  raised, starting on page 2. Our responses to each of these detailed  concerns are provided below.", "The OIG stated that our report does not focus on the most important  cases, but focuses primarily on case referrals regarding senior officials  that were not handled by the OIG because the allegations were lower risk  or because of resource constraints. In addition, the OIG stated that GAO  risks presenting a skewed picture of the OIG\u2019s oversight work. We  disagree with this characterization of our findings. We requested that the  OIG provide us with data from the OIG\u2019s Master Case Index (MCI)  information system that would allow us to select a sample of cases, in  accordance with the scope of our review. The OIG was unable to provide  the requested information due to several reasons. Instead, the OIG  provided data from the OIG Hotline and Office of Investigations case- management systems (subsystems within MCI) that contained a limited  number of fields for analysis and 23 cases pertaining to SES misconduct  that were referred to VA for investigation during GAO\u2019s period of review.  Therefore, as we discuss in the report, we were only able to review the 23  senior-official misconduct cases included in our report because the OIG  was only able to provide related documentation for these cases. The OIG  stated that we only reviewed a sample of just 23 case referrals from fiscal  years 2011 through 2014. As described, we reviewed all 23 senior-official  misconduct cases that were referred to VA for investigation that the OIG  was able to provide us, not a sample.", "The OIG stated that our report inaccurately states that the extracts  received from the MCI information system contained missing information.  We disagree with this characterization of our findings. Our review  included a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of the OIG\u2019s data.  To conduct this assessment, we requested an explanation of each data  field to clarify when fields are normally populated and how they are used.  Our findings are consistent with the information provided in response to  this request. For example, the OIG\u2019s response to our data-reliability  assessment stated that the data field used to identify the type of  allegations being investigated should never be blank. However, we found  that field to be blank in some cases in the data that were provided to us,  though the OIG asserted that the MCI information system is a relational  database where each case may be associated with multiple allegations  and codes. In response to the OIG\u2019s comments on our report, we  requested supporting documentation to demonstrate that the fields  analyzed during our period of review did not contain missing data. The  OIG provided the MCI information system user\u2019s manual that contains  detailed procedures for accessing and entering data into the MCI  information system, and a compilation of various internal documents.  However, the documentation did not provide evidence of the  completeness of data entered into the MCI information system as part of  quality-assurance reviews performed by the OIG or other designated  entity. Absent evidence of data-quality reviews aimed at assessing the  accuracy and completeness of data contained in the MCI information  system, we did not change the conclusions based on our previous  analysis.", "The OIG stated that our report provides incomplete information regarding  sampled cases and mischaracterized one of the OIG\u2019s case referrals in  the body of the report. We disagree with this characterization of our  findings. Specifically, the OIG said that we inaccurately stated that a  medical center director conducted the investigation into his own alleged  misconduct and found no allegations were substantiated. The synopsis  included in our report clearly articulates that the medical center director  was named in the allegation for having received a similar complaint  involving time and attendance abuse by a physician. The medical center  director, who provided the response to the OIG, was implicated in the  allegation as having not addressed a similar time and attendance  complaint regarding the same physician 2 years earlier. The OIG did not  provide any supporting documentation to demonstrate that the alleged  time and attendance abuse allegations against the physician were not  substantiated.", "The OIG stated that our report inaccurately stated that the medical center  director conducted his own investigation of himself and found no  allegations were substantiated. We disagree. In response to the OIG\u2019s  comments on our report, we requested that the OIG provide additional  support used to determine that the medical center director did not  investigate the allegation in which he was named. The additional case  documentation provided by the OIG further reaffirmed our assessment  that the medical center director performed his own investigation and  found no allegations were substantiated. Additional documentation  provided by the OIG indicated that the OIG referred the case to the  Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) for a response. However,  documentation we examined during the course of our audit, and the  documentation provided in response to our draft report, indicates that the  medical center director performed the investigation of the allegations and  then the results were routed through the VISN back to the OIG. The OIG  stated that routing the response through the VISN should address our  concerns of independence. This process does not address our concerns  regarding independence because VA Directive 0701 states that all  responses to Hotline case referrals must contain evidence of an  independent review by an official separate from and at a higher grade  than the subject / alleged wrongdoer. In this case, the name of the  medical center director who signed the facility response provided to the  OIG was the same individual named in the allegations.", "The OIG stated that the report does not provide a balanced presentation  of the rigor with which the OIG reviews all incoming Hotline contacts and  case responses. We disagree with this characterization of our findings. As  described above, the OIG was unable to provide comprehensive data to  select a sample of OIG audits, evaluations, and inspections for review  due to the limitations cited. We focused on misconduct involving senior  officials consistently with the scope of our review and thoroughly reviewed  all 23 senior-official misconduct cases that were referred to VA for  investigation, which were the only cases that the OIG was able to provide.", "The OIG stated that the description for one of the cases included in  appendix V of the draft report was incomplete because we misunderstood  the OIG\u2019s process. We disagree with this characterization. In response to  the OIG\u2019s comments on our report, we requested additional supporting  documentation. The documentation provided reaffirmed our assessment  that another medical center director performed his own investigation and  found no allegations were substantiated. Similar to the case described  above, the medical center director completed his own investigation and  then routed the response through the VISN back to the OIG. In contrast to  the previous case, however, the Hotline Workgroup reviewed the  response to the OIG and found it to be insufficient. Specifically, the OIG  noted that the medical center director who provided the response was the  subject of the complaint, despite the response being directed to the VISN,  and requested clarification. The VISN informed the OIG that it is not its  policy for the complainant to have any involvement in the review and data  submission on a case in which the complainant is involved. The VISN  stated that while this did obviously occur in this instance, it has taken  steps to ensure it does not occur in the future. The supporting evidence  provided for the case included in appendix V also contradicts the OIG\u2019s  previous assertion that the routing of a response through the entity with  oversight (VISN) over the medical center director should have addressed  GAO\u2019s concerns of independence.", "The OIG stated our report provides a misrepresentation of the OIG\u2019s  failure to follow internal policies for department responses. We disagree.  According to OIG statements on page 4 of the OIG\u2019s letter, Hotline  analysts are allowed to exercise some discretion in accepting responses  that may include minor departures from the six elements required in VA  Directive 0701. We continue to believe that in order to have a complete  response to a referral, all six elements required by the directive should be  addressed. On the basis of our review, the OIG does not have an  effective method to ensure that cases referred to VA are reviewed in  accordance with VA Directive 0701. Out of the 23 cases we reviewed,  only 4 included sufficient documentation needed to support VA\u2019s findings,  and we could not identify a case that contained all six elements required  in VA Directive 0701. This suggests that the current OIG review process  is not adequately resolving case referrals, as asserted by the OIG\u2019s  response. In addition, VA Directive 0701 does not currently include a  provision that would allow Hotline analysts to deviate from the six  required elements. As stated in our report, the OSC also raised concerns  regarding 40 percent of disclosure cases that were referred to VA facility  and program offices.", "The OIG stated that much of the information in the draft report is dated  and ignores system updates, specifically several key Hotline-related  process improvements since 2014. Although our review began in 2015,  we disagree with this characterization of our findings. In our report, we  included relevant improvements to demonstrate where the OIG was able  to provide support for those improvements. For example, our report  discusses: (1) a new process for communicating the scope of reviews that  involve matters referred by the OSC to the Office of the Secretary, (2) a  description on the VA website of the process for employees who wish to  report criminal or other activity to the OIG, (3) a new Enterprise  Management System, and (4) a new process for receiving whistle-blower  disclosures by the Secretary. In response to the OIG\u2019s comments on our  report, we requested additional documentation for any systems, practices,  or personnel changes that have been implemented since 2011, including  improvements to Hotline-related processes since 2014 that were not  included in our report. In response, the OIG provided a copy of the OIG\u2019s  organizational chart (current as of Apr. 23, 2018), described the oversight  responsibilities of each OIG component, and summarized the pertinent  staff positions within each component. On the basis of this  documentation, we identified a new office (the Office of Special Reviews),  a promotion, staff reassignments, and numerous vacancies during our  review period. However, the OIG did not provide evidence of any  measures to improve the MCI information system, case-referral  processes, or relevant staff roles that were not already included in our  report.", "As described above, the OIG was unable to provide comprehensive data  to select a sample of OIG audits, evaluations, and inspections for our  initial review due to the limitations cited. In response to the OIG\u2019s  comments on our report, we requested documentation related to any  significant changes that have been made to the MCI information system  that allows the OIG to identify all allegations of misconduct for export and  analysis. The OIG provided additional information regarding overall  departmental achievements that are highlighted in the OIG\u2019s Semiannual  Report to Congress, and other products from its website published  between fiscal years 2011 through 2018. We recognize the OIG\u2019s broader  administrative and oversight work described in the published reports.  However, this information does not address changes specifically made to  the MCI information system that would enable the OIG to analyze cases  pertaining to alleged misconduct by senior officials that we requested.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and other interested  parties.

To determine the  reliability of VA\u2019s misconduct data, we analyzed the contents of the 12  information systems operated by various offices across VA. These data  encompass each of the three major administrations that constitute VA\u2014 the National Cemetery Administration (NCA), Veterans Benefits  Administration (VBA), and Veterans Health Administration (VHA). We  selected the information systems based on our discussions with VA  officials and staff that oversee the data and, hence, identified databases  capable of collecting information pertaining to either employee  misconduct or disciplinary actions. Data fields were selected based on  whether they would provide beneficial information to better understand  the disciplinary process.", "VA\u2019s Personnel and Accounting Integrated Data (PAID) system, which  was developed to track payroll actions, contains information about  adverse disciplinary actions that affect employee salary department-wide.  We obtained an extract of all adverse disciplinary actions from the PAID  system.", "We assessed the reliability of each system for the purposes of identifying  and tracking misconduct cases. To do this, we performed electronic tests  on 12 information systems to determine the completeness and accuracy  of the fields contained in the data files. We also submitted to the  overseeing offices for all 12 information systems general data-quality  questions regarding the purpose of the data, their structure, definitions  and values for certain fields, automated and manual data-quality checks  to ensure the accuracy of the data, and limitations. As discussed further,  the data were generally not reliable for a department-wide assessment of  all misconduct and disciplinary actions due to the lack of completeness  and compatibility of the data across all information systems. VA staff  could not confirm whether some of the missing data we identified were  artifacts of the database extraction process VA used to assemble the data  files we used in our review. Despite challenges with aspects of the data,  we found the data sufficiently reliable for conducting analysis where fields  were populated and field definition concurrence was obtained by program  offices.", "For the second objective, we selected a generalizable stratified random  sample of 544 misconduct cases from October 2009 through May 2015.  Where available, we reviewed the employees\u2019 disciplinary-action files and  Electronic Official Personnel Folders to determine the extent to which  VA\u2019s actions were consistent with disciplinary policy outlined in VA  Handbook 5021, Employee/Management Relations. These data  encompass each of the three major administrations that constitute VA\u2014 NCA, VBA, and VHA. We determined the data to be sufficiently reliable  for analysis of disciplinary actions affecting salary that resulted from  misconduct that was not reported to supervisors directly from employees.  Accordingly, our sample only includes misconduct cases that resulted in a  change in salary or were reported to departmental organizations within  the 12 information systems selected.", "We developed a data-collection instrument to document the results of our  case reviews. We revised our data-collection instrument to address  issues found during the course of our analysis, and developed a  companion document that outlined the decision rules for reviewing cases.", "We also designated two primary reviewers to ensure the decision rules  were consistently applied across all cases.", "Our review of laws and regulations revealed that disciplinary rules  sometimes vary depending on whether employees fall under Title 5, Title  38, or hybrid Title 5 and Title 38 hiring authority. To minimize confusion  associated with these differences, we incorporated criteria into our data- collection instrument. In addition, we were unable to obtain complete case  information for 25 percent of the cases. For these cases, we obtained  direct access to the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) Electronic  Official Personnel Folders system to attempt to recover some of the  missing information. Ultimately, we were unable to complete our review  for 10 percent of cases in our sample because of missing files.", "In addition to reporting missing case information, we used our  generalizable analysis results to project VA-wide figures for several data  elements that were not in compliance with VA policy.

These cases represent the universe of VA disclosures  accepted by the OSC. Of the 135 disclosure cases referred to VA, 53  cases were referred to VA facility and program offices for further  investigation.

For these 130  disclosure cases, we reviewed OSC and OIG investigative reports, as  well as PAID roster files, to gather additional information to perform  analysis of potential retaliation. We also interviewed six individual whistle- blowers with formal disclosure cases accepted by the OSC, indicating  that the OSC had previously reviewed the case and determined that it  contained sufficient evidence and merit to warrant further investigation.", "Our analysis of potential retaliation comprised two parts. First, we  compared the 129 employees associated with the selected OSC cases to  the PAID rosters using the complainants\u2019 information to determine  whether employees associated with the selected OSC cases were more  likely to leave the agency. We identified the overall count and proportion  (across years) of roster-matched employees who made a disclosure  between fiscal years 2010 through 2014 but were not employed at VA the  following fiscal year. Second, to determine whether employees  associated with the selected OSC cases were more likely to receive  disciplinary action, we also calculated the yearly totals and proportion of  roster-matched employees identified above for whom a record existed in  the PAID disciplinary action information system. We did this by comparing  the proportion of employees who received one or more disciplinary  actions in the year prior to the appearance in the roster, in the same fiscal  year as the roster, and in the subsequent fiscal year. We also completed  this analysis utilizing the PAID roster file to determine the yearly  proportion of all VA employees who left the agency. On the basis of the  results of our analysis, we reported by fiscal year the percentage of  whistle-blowers that received disciplinary action or left VA at a higher rate  than the overall VA population following a disclosure.", "To address all objectives, we interviewed senior officials from VA\u2019s major  components responsible for investigating and adjudicating cases of  employee misconduct.
