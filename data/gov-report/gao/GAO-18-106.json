CSPF is one of the nation's largest multiemployer defined benefit pension plans, covering about 385,000 participants. Since 1982, the plan has operated under a court-enforceable consent decree which, among other things, requires that the plan's assets be managed by independent parties. Within 7 years, CSPF estimates that the plan's financial condition will require severe benefit cuts. GAO was asked to review the events and factors that led to the plan's critical financial status and how its investment outcomes compare to similar plans.", "GAO describes (1) what is known about the factors that contributed to CSPF's critical financial condition; (2) what has been CSPF's investment policy, and the process for setting and executing it, since the consent decree was established; and (3) how CSPF's investments have performed over time, particularly compared to similar pension plans.", "GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations; interviewed CSPF representatives, International Brotherhood of Teamsters officials and members, federal officials, and knowledgeable industry stakeholders; reviewed CSPF documentation including investment policy statements and board of trustee meeting minutes; and analyzed investment returns and fees from required, annual pension plan filings and from consultant benchmarking reports."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund (CSPF) was established in 1955 to provide pension benefits to trucking industry workers, and is one of the largest multiemployer plans. According to its regulatory filings, CSPF had less than half the estimated funds needed to cover plan liabilities in 1982 at the time it entered into a court-enforceable consent decree that provides for oversight of certain plan activities. Since then, CSPF has made some progress toward achieving its targeted level of funding; however, CSPF has never been more than 75 percent funded and its funding level has weakened since 2002, as shown in the figure below.", "Stakeholders GAO interviewed identified numerous factors that contributed to CSPF's financial condition. For example, stakeholders stated that changes within the trucking industry as well as a decline in union membership contributed to CSPF's inability to maintain a healthy contribution base. CSPF's active participants made up about 69 percent of all participants in 1982, but accounted for only 16 percent in 2016. The most dramatic change in active participants occurred in 2007 when the United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) withdrew from the plan. At that time, UPS accounted for about 30 percent of the plan's active participants (i.e. workers). In addition, the market declines of 2001 to 2002 and 2008 had a significant negative impact on the plan's long-term investment performance. Stakeholders noted that while each individual factor contributed to CSPF's critical financial condition, the interrelated nature of the factors also had a cumulative effect on the plan's financial condition.", "Both CSPF's investment policy and the process for setting and executing it have changed several times since the consent decree was established in 1982. The original consent decree gave an independent asset manager\u2014called a named fiduciary\u2014exclusive authority to set and change the plan's investment policies and manage plan assets, and prohibited CSPF trustees from managing assets or making investment decisions. Initially, the named fiduciaries sold the troubled real estate assets acquired during the pre-consent decree era. Subsequent changes include the following:", "In 1993, the named fiduciaries started to increase investment in equities, and their policies continued to direct that asset allocations be weighted toward equities until early 2017.", "Between 2003 and 2010, the court approved three plan decisions to move a total of 50 percent of CSPF's assets into passively-managed accounts (passive management typically seeks to match the performance of a specific market index and reduce investment fees).", "An early-2017 investment policy change precipitated by CSPF's deteriorating financial condition will continue to move plan assets into fixed income investments ahead of projected insolvency, or the date when CSPF is expected to have insufficient assets to pay promised benefits when due. As a result, assets will be gradually transitioned from \u201creturn-seeking assets\u201d\u2014such as equities and emerging markets debt\u2014to high-quality investment grade debt and U.S. Treasury securities with intermediate and short-term maturities. The plan is projected to become insolvent on January 1, 2025. CSPF officials and named fiduciary representatives said these changes are intended to reduce the plan's exposure to market risk and volatility, and provide participants greater certainty prior to projected insolvency.", "GAO found that CSPF's investment returns and expenses were generally in line with similarly sized institutional investors and with demographically similar multiemployer pension plans. For example, GAO's analysis of returns using the peer group measure used by CSPF known as the Wilshire Associates' Trust Universe Comparison Service (TUCS), showed that CSPF's annual investment returns since 1995 were above the median about as many times as they were below. Similarly, comparing CSPF's returns to a peer group of similar multiemployer defined benefit plans using federally required annual reports found that CSPF's annual investment returns were in line with those of its peers. Specifically, CSPF's annual returns were above the median nine times and below it six times\u2014and CSPF's overall (dollar-weighted) average annual return from 2000 through 2014 was close to that of the peer median average return of 4.8 percent.", "In addition, GAO found that CSPF's investment fees and other administrative expenses have also been in line with other large multiemployer plans. For example:", "CSPF's investment fees as a percentage of assets were about 9 percent lower than the median of large defined benefit multiemployer plans over the 2000 through 2014 period\u2014though much of that difference is accounted for by a relative reduction in investment fees since 2007. CSPF's investment fees as a percentage of assets were, on average, about 34 basis points (or 0.34 percent).", "CSPF's administrative expenses related to the day-to-day operations of the plan have also been in line with other large multiemployer plans. CSPF's administrative expenses per participant were below the median for large defined benefit multiemployer plans for 12 of the 15 years over the 2000 through 2014 period. As of 2014, CSPF's administrative expense was $98 per participant, which is about 16 percent less than the median for large defined benefit multiemployer plans."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations in this report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Established in 1955 to provide pension benefits to trucking industry  workers, the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension  Fund (CSPF) is one of the nation\u2019s largest multiemployer pension plans,  with $15.3 billion in assets at the end of 2016. About 1,400 employers are  obligated to contribute to CSPF, and the plan covers almost 385,000  participants. Since 1982, the plan has operated under a court- enforceable consent decree which, among other things, requires it to  obtain approval from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of  Illinois, Eastern Division, for certain plan activities and requires  independent asset managers to manage the plan\u2019s investments.  Currently, CSPF is projected to become insolvent within 7 years and is  classified as a \u201ccritical and declining\u201d plan under the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended by  subsequent laws, including the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of  2014 (MPRA). In addition to causing financial hardship for hundreds of  thousands of CSPF retirees who are at risk of severe benefit cuts,  CSPF\u2019s projected insolvency is also likely to coincide with the projected  insolvency of the multiemployer insurance program managed by the  Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). The insolvency of  PBGC\u2019s multiemployer program would significantly impact the level of  PBGC-guaranteed benefits to current and future beneficiaries in all  multiemployer plans receiving PBGC assistance. CSPF\u2019s critical and declining status has sparked interest in understanding the broad factors  that have caused the plan\u2019s decline and what role, if any, the plan\u2019s  investment policies have played in contributing to this condition.

To describe the major  factors that led to CSPF\u2019s critical financial condition, we conducted 23  semi-structured interviews with federal agency officials and other  stakeholders knowledgeable about unions, participants and retirees, the  trucking industry, collective bargaining agreements, and multiemployer  pension plans. We also interviewed three stakeholders with actuarial  expertise to specifically understand actuarial standards and procedures.  In our semi-structured interviews we asked about key factors affecting the  plan and the broader regulatory and financial environment in which  multiemployer plans operate. We selected knowledgeable stakeholders  based on a review of literature and prior GAO work, and  recommendations from other stakeholders. Additionally, we selected  stakeholders whose expertise coincided with the scope of our objectives  and who would be able to provide a broad range of perspectives. We also  collected actuarial, financial, and other data on current and historical  measures of plan assets, liabilities, investment performance, and other  factors, and performed our own analyses of these data. The data and  documentation collected were generally from the plan or agencies that  oversee pensions. We determined the information to be generally reliable  for the purposes of our objectives.", "To describe CSPF\u2019s investment policy and the process for setting and  executing it since the consent decree was established, we reviewed  CSPF\u2019s investment policy statements, performance reports from the  plan\u2019s named fiduciaries, select board of trustee meeting minutes, and  select correspondence between CSPF and DOL. We also interviewed  CSPF and federal officials about a recent investment policy change. To  analyze CSPF\u2019s performance, we examined its investment returns in  comparison to a customized Wilshire Associates\u2019 (Wilshire) Trust  Universe Comparison Service benchmark of trusts with $3 billion or more  in assets. CSPF provided these data, and they also included these data  in the independent special counsel reports. Wilshire provided  supplemental data using the same benchmark specifications. We also  analyzed investment returns and fee and expense data from the Form  5500, the government\u2019s primary source of information about pension  plans. We used this Form 5500 data to examine CSPF\u2019s investment  returns and fees and expenses in comparison to groups of similar  multiemployer pension plans. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), DOL,  and PBGC jointly developed the Form 5500-series returns for employee  benefit plans to satisfy annual reporting requirements under ERISA and  the Internal Revenue Code. We primarily relied on PBGC\u2019s Form 5500  research database as the agency takes several steps to correct and  update the raw electronic data. We also took steps to assess the  reliability of the PBGC data and checked data fields and made  appropriate corrections. In addition, we performed computer analyses of  the data and identified inconsistencies and other indications of error and  took steps to correct inconsistencies or errors. A second analyst checked  all computer analyses. After these processes, we determined the data to  be sufficiently reliable for our purposes.

Multiemployer plans are typically found in  industries with many small employers such as trucking, building and  construction, and retail food sales. In 2017, there were about 1,400  defined benefit multiemployer plans nationwide covering more than 10  million participants."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Multiemployer Plan Administration, Funding, and Benefits", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Administration", "paragraphs": ["Most multiemployer plans are jointly administered and governed by a  board of trustees selected by labor and management. The labor union  typically determines how the trustees representing labor are chosen and  the contributing employers or an employer association typically  determines how the trustees representing management are chosen. The  trustees set the overall plan policy, direct plan activities, and set benefit  levels (see fig. 1).", "Multiemployer plans are \u201cprefunded,\u201d or funded in advance, primarily by  employer contributions. The employer contribution is generally  negotiated through a collective bargaining agreement, and is often based  on a dollar amount per hour worked by each employee covered by the  agreement. Employer contributions are pooled in a trust fund for  investment purposes, to pay benefits to retirees and their beneficiaries,  and for administrative expenses. Multiemployer plan trustees typically  decide how the trust fund should be invested to meet the plan\u2019s  objectives, but the trustees can use investment managers to determine  how the trust fund should be invested. Multiemployer plan trust funds  can be allocated among many different types of assets, any of which can  generally be passively- or actively-managed, domestically or  internationally based, or publicly or nonpublicly traded (see table 1).", "A plan\u2019s funded percentage is its ratio of plan assets to plan liabilities.  Because the amount needed to pay pension benefits for many years into  the future cannot be known with certainty due to a variety of economic  and demographic factors, including the potential volatility of asset values,  estimates of a plan\u2019s funded percentage may vary from year to year.  Defined benefit pension plans use a \u201cdiscount rate\u201d to convert projected  future benefits into their \u201cpresent value.\u201d The discount rate is the interest  rate used to determine the current value of estimated future benefit  payments and is an integral part of estimating a plan\u2019s liabilities. The  higher the discount rate, the lower the plan\u2019s estimate of its liability.  Multiemployer plans use an \u201cassumed-return approach\u201d that bases the  discount rate on a long-term assumed average rate of return on the  pension plan\u2019s assets. Under this approach, the discount rate depends on  the allocation of plan assets. For example, a reallocation of plan assets  into more stocks and fewer bonds typically increases the discount rate,  which reduces the estimated value of plan liabilities, and therefore,  reduces the minimum amount of funding required.", "Looking at the entire \u201cmultiemployer system\u201d\u2014the aggregation of  multiemployer plans governed by ERISA and insured by PBGC\u2014shows  that while the system was significantly underfunded around 2001 and  2009, its funded position has improved since 2009.

The DOL investigation ultimately  resulted in the establishment of a federal court-enforceable consent  decree in 1982 that remains in force today. CSPF held more than $4.3  billion in Net Assets at the end of 1982 after the consent decree was  established. The plan\u2019s Net Assets peaked at nearly $26.8 billion at the  end of 2007 and declined to about $15.3 billion at the end of 2016 (see  fig. 2).

By 2015, only three of the  plan\u2019s 50 largest employers from 1980 still paid into the plan, and for each  full-time active employee there were over five nonworking participants,  mainly retirees. As a result, benefit payments to CSPF retirees have  exceeded employer contributions in every year since 1984. Thus, CSPF  has generally drawn down its investment assets. In 2016, CSPF withdrew  over $2 billion from investment assets (see fig. 3.).", "CSPF has historically had fewer plan assets than were needed to fully  fund the accrued liability\u2014the difference referred to as unfunded liability.

As a result of its investigation, DOL filed suit against the former  trustees of CSPF and, in September 1982, the parties entered into a  consent decree, which remains in force today. The consent decree  provides measures intended to ensure that the plan complies with the  requirements of ERISA, including providing for oversight by the court and  DOL, and prescribes roles for multiple parties in its administration. For  example, certain plan activities must be submitted to DOL for comment  and to the court for approval, including new trustee approvals and some  investment manager appointments. According to DOL, to prevent  criminal influence from regaining a foothold of control over plan assets,  the consent decree generally requires court-approved independent asset  managers\u2014called \u201cnamed fiduciaries\u201d\u2014to manage CSPF\u2019s investments.

For multiemployer plans, the triggering event  is plan insolvency, the point at which a plan begins to run out of money  while not having sufficient assets to pay the full benefits that were  originally promised when due. PBGC does not take over operations of an  insolvent multiemployer plan; rather, it provides loan assistance to pay  administrative expenses and benefits up to the PBGC-guaranteed level.  According to PBGC, only once in its history has a financial assistance  loan from the multiemployer pension insurance program been repaid. In  2017, PBGC provided financial assistance to 72 insolvent multiemployer  plans for an aggregate amount of $141 million. For single-employer plans  the triggering event is termination of an underfunded plan\u2014generally,  when the employer goes out of business or enters bankruptcy.

The annual premium rate for plan  years beginning in January 2017 was $28 per participant and it is  adjusted annually based on the national average wage index. (See app.  II for the PBGC premium rates that have been in effect since the consent  decree was established in 1982.) When plans receive financial  assistance, participants face a reduction in benefits. For example, using  2013 data, PBGC estimated 21 percent of more than 59,000 selected  participants in insolvent multiemployer plans then receiving financial  assistance from PBGC faced a benefit reduction.

In addition to being underfunded prior to the consent decree going into  effect, stakeholders identified other specific factors that contributed to  CSPF\u2019s critical financial condition, such as trends within the national  trucking industry and its workforce, funding challenges and common  investment practices of multiemployer plans, and the impact of market  downturns on long-term investment performance. Stakeholders also  described the effects of the 2007 withdrawal of a key employer, United  Parcel Service (UPS), on CSPF\u2019s critical financial condition."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Key Industry Specific Workforce Trends", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholders we interviewed said changes to the workforce, such as  declining union membership rates and changes resulting from industry  deregulation, affected CSPF and some other multiemployer plans by  reducing the number of workers able to participate in their plans. While  the multiemployer structure distributes bankruptcy risk across many  employers, for any particular multiemployer plan employers are often  concentrated in the same industry, making the plans vulnerable to  industry- specific trends and risks. For example, stakeholders noted the  impact that the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 had on the trucking industry.  Specifically, deregulation of the trucking industry reduced government  oversight and regulation over interstate trucking shipping rates. The  trucking industry became increasingly dominated by nonunion trucking  companies resulting in the bankruptcy of many unionized trucking  companies, according to stakeholders. New trucking companies typically  did not join multiemployer plans because their labor force was not  unionized and this, coupled with the bankruptcy of many contributing  employers, contributed to a decrease in active participant populations for  many plans serving the industry. As the total number of active participants  in a plan declines, the resources from which to collect employer  contributions declines proportionally. Stakeholders also said these  changes were unforeseeable. Limitations on a plan\u2019s ability to increase  contributions mean that a plan has less capacity to recover from an  underfunded position or to make up for investment returns that fall short  of expectations.", "A decline in the number of active workers can also accelerate plan  \u201cmaturity,\u201d as measured by the ratio of nonworking to working  participants. Plan maturity has implications for a plan\u2019s investment  practices and the time frame over which the plan must be funded.  According to PBGC\u2019s data for the multiemployer plans it insures, there  were approximately three active participants for every nonworking  participant in 1980 (3:1); by 2014, the ratio was approximately one active  worker for every two nonworking participants (1:2). Figure 6 shows the  change in the percentages of active and nonworking participants for the  multiemployer plans that PBGC insures.", "CSPF saw an even more dramatic change in its active to nonworking  participant ratio from 1982 through 2015. In 1982, there were more than  two active workers for every nonworking participant (2:1) and by 2016  that ratio had fallen to approximately one active worker for every five  nonworking participants (1:5) (see fig. 7). Because CSPF\u2019s contributing  employers were largely trucking companies, stakeholders said this made  the fund especially vulnerable to industry-wide shocks. Like the industry  as a whole, CSPF was unable to attract new employers to replace exiting  employers, in part because of the lack of new unionized employers.", "CSPF officials said that changes to the trucking industry and its workforce  also led to other challenges for the plan. For example, contributions to the  plan declined with the shrinking number of active workers. CSPF officials  told us they could not significantly increase the contribution rate paid by  remaining employers because of the financial hardship it would cause,  and as a result, the plan\u2019s ability to recover from its underfunded position  was limited. CSPF officials said that this increased the plan\u2019s reliance on  investment returns to try to close the gap between its assets and  liabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding Challenges and Investment Practices", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholders we interviewed cited challenges inherent in multiemployer  plans\u2019 funding and investment practices, and described how the  challenges may have contributed to the critical financial condition of some  plans, including CSPF.", "Stakeholders said that CSPF and many other multiemployer plans have  been challenged by employer withdrawals. An employer withdrawal  reduces the plan\u2019s number of active worker participants, thereby reducing  its contribution base and accelerating plan maturity. A withdrawing  employer generally must pay a share of any unfunded benefits.  Stakeholders identified several ways in which the withdrawal liability  framework could result in a withdrawing employer underpaying its share  of an unfunded liability. We have previously reported on the challenges  associated with withdrawal liability, including: withdrawal liability assessments are often paid over time, and  payment amounts are based on prior contribution rates rather than the  employer\u2019s actual withdrawal liability assessment. withdrawal liability payments are subject to a 20-year cap, regardless  of whether an employer\u2019s share of unfunded benefits has been fully  paid within this 20-year timeframe; plans often did not collect some or all of the scheduled withdrawal  liability payments because employers went bankrupt before  completing their scheduled payments; and  fears of withdrawal liability exposure increasing over time could be an  incentive for participating employers to leave a plan and a disincentive  for new employers to join a plan;  Stakeholders we interviewed also added that the calculation used to  determine withdrawal liability may use an investment return assumption  that inherently transfers risk to the plan.", "When exiting employers do not pay their share of unfunded benefits, any  remaining and future employers participating in the plan may effectively  assume the unpaid share as a part of their own potential withdrawal  liability as well as responsibility for the exiting employer\u2019s \u201corphaned\u201d  participants. Participating employers may negotiate a withdrawal if they  perceive a risk that the value of their potential withdrawal liability might  grow significantly over time.", "In its MPRA application, CSPF cited employer withdrawals and  bankruptcies as a significant challenge for the plan. CSPF reported that  after deregulation, the number of contributing employers dropped by over  70 percent. While some of the drop could be due to the consolidation of  trucking companies after deregulation, CSPF officials cited several cases  in which employers went bankrupt or withdrew from the plan, which  reduced the plan\u2019s contribution base and accelerated its maturity.  Additionally, when employers went bankrupt, they often did not pay their  full withdrawal liability. For example, CSPF said two of its major  contributing employers left the plan between 2001 and 2003, and left  $290 million of more than $403 million in withdrawal liability unpaid after  they went bankrupt.", "Stakeholders identified funding timeframes as a factor that contributed to  the challenges facing many multiemployer plans, including CSPF.  ERISA\u2019s minimum funding standards have historically allowed  multiemployer plans to amortize, or spread out the period of time for  funding certain events, such as investment shortfalls and benefit  improvements. For example, CSPF began a 40-year amortization of  approximately $6.1 billion in underfunding on January 1, 1981, giving the  plan until the end of 2021 to fully fund that amount. Longer amortization  periods increase the risk of plan underfunding due to the number and  magnitude of changes in the plan\u2019s environment that may occur, such as  a general decline in participants or deregulation of an industry. The  Pension Protection Act of 2006 shortened amortization periods for single- employer plans to 7 years and the amortization periods for multiemployer  plans to 15 years. Shorter amortization periods provide greater benefit  security to plan participants by reducing an unfunded liability more  rapidly. In addition, shorter amortization periods can be better aligned  with the projected timing of benefit payments for a mature plan. However,  shorter periods can be a source of hardship for plans with financially  troubled contributing employers because they may require higher  contributions. According to CSPF officials, CSPF requested and received  an additional 10-year amortization extension from the IRS in 2005 after  relating that contribution requirements could force participating employers  into bankruptcy. One CSPF representative said an amortization extension  can also help avoid subjecting the plan\u2019s employers to IRS excise taxes  for failing to make required minimum contributions.", "Stakeholders we interviewed said that certain common investment  practices may have played a role in the critical financial condition of  CSPF and other mature and declining plans. In general, multiemployer  plans invest in portfolios that are expected, on average, to produce higher  returns than a low-risk portfolio, such as one composed entirely of U.S.  Treasury securities. Stakeholders also stated that these investment  practices may have been too risky because returns can be more volatile,  and the higher expected returns might not be achieved. In addition, the  Congressional Budget Office has reported that if \u201cplans had been  required to fund their benefit liabilities\u2014at the time those liabilities were  accrued\u2014with safer investments, such as bonds, the underfunding of  multiemployer plans would have been far less significant and would pose  less risk to PBGC and beneficiaries.\u201d", "Stakeholders also told us that for mature plans like CSPF, these  investment practices can pose further challenges. Mature plans, with  fewer active employees, have less ability to recoup losses through  increased contributions and have less time to recoup losses through  investment returns before benefits must be paid. Market corrections, such  as those that occurred in 2001 through 2002 and in 2008, can be  particularly challenging to mature plans and their participants, especially if  a mature plan is also significantly underfunded. Mature plans could  mitigate these risks by investing more conservatively, however, the  resulting lower expected returns from more conservative investing  necessitates higher funding targets and contribution rates, which could be  a hardship for employers in an industry with struggling employers.  Alternatively, a plan that invests more conservatively may provide lower  promised benefits to accommodate the level of contributions it can collect.  Lower investment returns from a more conservative investment policy  would cost employers more in contributions and could potentially result in  employers leaving the plan. Further, investing in a conservative portfolio  would be relatively unique among multiemployer plans, and stakeholders  said plan managers may feel they are acting in a prudent fashion by  investing similarly to their peers. Underfunded plans like CSPF may not  see conservative investment as an option if they cannot raise the  contributions necessary to fully fund their vested benefits. Officials from  CSPF told us that, because they lacked the ability to significantly increase  revenue or decrease accrued benefits, the named fiduciaries sought  incrementally higher investment returns to meet funding thresholds  required by the amortization extension they received in 2005.", "On the other hand, there are challenges associated with risk bearing  investments. In our prior work, we reported that multiemployer plans  generally develop an assumed average rate of investment return and use  that assumption to determine funding targets, required contributions, and  the potential cost of benefit improvements. Experts we interviewed for  that report told us that using a portfolio\u2019s expected return to value the cost  of benefits increases the risk that insufficient assets could be on hand  when needed. They also told us that using the portfolio\u2019s expected return  to calculate liabilities could incentivize plans to invest in riskier assets and  to negotiate higher benefit levels because the higher returns expected  from riskier portfolios can result in lower reported liabilities.", "Plan Terms Set through Collective Bargaining  Stakeholders we interviewed said that plan terms, such as contribution  rates, which are set through the collective bargaining process, can create  an additional challenge for multiemployer plans. Employers in  multiemployer plans generally are not required to contribute beyond what  they have agreed to in collective bargaining, and these required employer  contributions generally do not change during the term of a collective  bargaining agreement. CSPF officials said that up until the early 2000s,  plan officials did not request modifications to collective bargaining  agreements, such as reallocating contribution dollars, to respond to  adverse investment returns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Investment Performance and Market Downturns", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholders highlighted the effects of market downturns on  multiemployer plan assets as another contributing factor to CSPF\u2019s critical  financial condition and that of other multiemployer plans. Failure to  achieve assumed returns has the effect of increasing unfunded liabilities.  For the multiemployer system in aggregate, the average annual return on  plan assets over the 2002 to 2014 period was about 6.1 percent, well  short of typical assumed returns of 7.0 or 7.5 percent in 2002.", "Many multiemployer plans were especially impacted by the 2008 market  downturn. PBGC estimated that from 2007 to 2009, the value of all  multiemployer plan assets fell by approximately 24 percent, or $103  billion, after accounting for contributions to and payments from the  plans. Although asset values recovered to some extent after 2009,  some plans continued to be significantly underfunded, and stakeholders  said this could be due to the contribution base not being sufficient to help  recover from investment shortfalls.", "CSPF\u2019s investment performance since 2000 has reflected performance  similar to other multiemployer plans and the plan went from 73 percent  funded in 2000 to about 38 percent funded in 2017. While the plan used  an assumed rate of return of 7.5 to 8.0 percent per year between 2000  and 2014, our analysis of the plan\u2019s regulatory filings shows that the  plan\u2019s weighted-average investment return over this period was about 4.9  percent per year. CSPF officials said the 2008 downturn significantly  reduced CSPF\u2019s assets and it was unable to sufficiently recoup those  losses when the market rebounded in 2009. Plan assets declined from  $26.8 billion at the beginning of 2008 to $17.4 billion at the beginning of  2009, with $7.5 billion of the decline attributable to investment losses.  Despite reporting a 26 percent return on assets during 2009, CSPF had  only $19.5 billion in assets at the end of 2009 because benefits and  expenses exceeded the contributions it collected and because it had  fewer assets generating returns for the plan. By the end of 2009, CSPF\u2019s  funding target was $35.9 billion but the fund had less than $20 billion that  could be used to generate investment returns. If CSPF\u2019s portfolio had  returned 7.5 percent per year over the 2000-2014 period, instead of the  approximately 4.9 percent we calculated, we estimate that the portfolio  value would have exceeded $32.0 billion at the end of 2014, or 91  percent of its Actuarial Accrued Liability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effect of UPS Withdrawal", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the factors mentioned that affected many multiemployer  plans, stakeholders we interviewed also noted the unique effect of the  UPS withdrawal on CSPF. In 2007, UPS negotiated with the International  Brotherhood of Teamsters for a withdrawal from CSPF and paid a  withdrawal liability payment of $6.1 billion. This payment was invested  just prior to the 2008 market downturn. Moreover, the loss of UPS,  CSPF\u2019s largest contributing employer, reduced the plan\u2019s ability to collect  needed contributions if the plan became more underfunded. A UPS  official said that, following the market decline of 2001-2002, the company  considered whether it should withdraw from all multiemployer plans  because it did not want to be the sole contributing employer in any plan.  According to this official, UPS considered the large number of UPS  employees in CSPF and the plan\u2019s demographics\u2014such as an older  population and fewer employers\u2014in its decision to withdraw. CSPF  officials said they did not want UPS to withdraw because its annual  contributions accounted for about one-third of all contributions to the plan.

Additionally, stakeholders noted that although each of the factors that  contributed to CSPF\u2019s critical financial condition individually is important,  their interrelated nature also had a cumulative effect on the plan. Industry  deregulation, declines in collective bargaining, and the plan\u2019s significantly  underfunded financial condition all impaired CSPF\u2019s ability to maintain a  population of active workers sufficient to supply its need for contributions  when investment shortfalls developed. Given historical rules for plan  funding and industry stresses, CSPF was unable to capture adequate  funding from participating employers either before or after they withdrew  from the plan. The plan\u2019s financial condition was further impaired when  long-term investment performance fell short of expectations.

Specifically, starting in 1999, the plan  temporarily shifted to a dual named fiduciary structure and increased its  use of passively-managed accounts\u2014both described in detail below\u2014 changing the named fiduciary structure that had been in place since the  original consent decree (see fig. 11).", "More specifically, the two key changes to the plan\u2019s investment  management structure were:", "A temporary shift to a dual named fiduciary structure. Effective in  1999, CSPF proposed and the court approved allocating plan assets  between two named fiduciaries instead of one in order to diversify  CSPF\u2019s investment approach, among other things.

Goldman Sachs was named fiduciary for \u201cGroup  B\u201d assets between 2000 and 2010. In 2010, an investment consultant  found the performance of two named fiduciaries under the dual  named fiduciary structure had been similar and more expensive than  it would be under a proposed move back to a single named  fiduciary.

In addition, both of the named fiduciaries reported that they had  not outperformed the industry index for the domestic fixed income  assets they managed after they were approved as named fiduciaries  in 1999 and 2000 through February 2003. Similarly, in 2007 and  2010, CSPF officials said that two more passively-managed accounts  were created to further reduce plan fees.

For example,  when UPS withdrew from the plan in December 2007, it paid $6.1 billion  in a lump sum to fulfill its withdrawal liability. Consistent with the named  fiduciaries\u2019 investment policies during this time period, the majority of this  withdrawal payment was invested in equity assets.

Plan investment fees and administrative expenses are often paid  from plan assets so many plans seek to keep these fees and expenses  low. Additionally, investment fees are likely to be related to the value of  assets under management, and plans with greater asset values tend to  be able to negotiate more advantageous fee rates. According to a  pension consultant and a DOL publication, investment management fees  are typically a large defined benefit plan\u2019s largest category of expense,  but a pension plan also incurs a number of lesser expenses related to  administering the plan.

Over the 2000 to 2014 period, CSPF\u2019s  average annual investment fee expense ratio was 34 basis points (0.34  percent) while the median of the averages for our large plan comparison  group was 37 basis points (0.37 percent). While CSPF\u2019s average  investment fee expense ratio was below the median for its comparison  group over the period we examined, the relationship of CSPF\u2019s annual  ratio to the annual median changed over time.

First, CSPF  introduced the passively-managed accounts beginning in 2003\u2014as noted  earlier, and CSPF moved certain assets to those accounts in an effort to  reduce fees. Second, the change back to a single named fiduciary,  which was suggested as an expense saving move, occurred in the middle  of the 2007 to 2014 period analyzed.

Investment fees  may be sensitive to a plan\u2019s particular investment strategy and the way  assets are allocated. For example, with CSPF, a named fiduciary has  responsibility for executing the investment strategy and allocations.  According to a representative from Northern Trust\u2014the current named  fiduciary\u2014CSPF pays a fee of about 5 basis points for named fiduciary  services, and this, combined with investment management fees, is in line  with investment fees for other clients (though the overall fees depend on  the types of asset allocations and investment strategies).", "Figure 20 shows how CSPF\u2019s administrative (or non-investment)  expenses compare to those of other large plans on a per participant  basis.

By closely replicating the methodology of that  study, we found CSPF\u2019s expenses of $98 per participant in 2014 fell  below the median expense rate of $124 dollars per participant but above  the lowest quartile of this group of large multiemployer plans. In comparing administrative expenses as a percentage of benefits paid, we  found CSPF\u2019s administrative expenses were among the lowest 5 percent  of this group of large multiemployer plans. We performed a similar  comparison against the peer group of large plans. CSPF had the  lowest administrative expense rate among the large plan peer group in  2014, paying administrative expenses at a rate of 1.4 percent of benefits  paid.

Plans may have unique organizational structures and attribute expenses  differently. For example, one plan may contract a significant portion of  administrative duties with a third-party, while another plan may administer  the plan in-house. According to an actuary we interviewed, most  multiemployer plans are administered by a third-party, but the plan\u2019s in- house staff will still retain a number of duties.

We selected the 20 plans that had the largest plan asset values.  This includes CSPF, which was the second largest multiemployer plan  as of the beginning of 2014.

Mature plans (in terms of retiree liability proportions). We ordered  multiemployer defined benefit plans by their similarity to CSPF\u2019s ratio  of retiree to total liabilities as of the beginning of calendar year 2000.  The ratio of retiree to total liabilities is defined as line 2(b)1(3) of the  2000 Schedule B divided by total liabilities of line 2(b)4(3) of the 2000  Schedule B. To compare retiree to total liability ratios, we created a  variable for the absolute value of the difference between CSPF\u2019s ratio  and that of a given plan. We ordered the plans by ascending  differences in the ratios (excluding any with missing differences).  CSPF was the top plan because its difference is zero by definition.  Because one of our key analyses of the data involved comparing  investment returns across plans, we also limited the comparable plans  to those that shared a common plan year with CSPF (specifically if  they have the same plan year-end of December 31). Of the plans that  had the same plan year as CSPF and assets over $300 million, we  selected the 20 plans (including CSPF) that had the smallest absolute  difference from CSPF in the retiree-to-total liability ratio. Plans with a  high ratio of liabilities attributable to retirees will have a relatively large  portion of future benefit payments attributable to those that are older  and retired. By selecting plans that were similarly mature to CSPF  (and had $300 million in assets as of the beginning of 2000), we  identified plans that may have had a similar basis for their plan  investments, similar cash flow characteristics, or similar potential  deviations between time-weighted and dollar-weighted average  investment returns over time (see section below entitled \u201cCalculation  of Average Investment Return over Multiple Years\u201d). That is, these  plans should have roughly similar cost advantages and similar  considerations in their investment objectives such as the balance of  cash flows into and out of the fund and the plans\u2019 investment  horizons. Similarity in the balance of cash flows is important because  it helps to mitigate the influence of plan maturity on the weighted  average investment return over multiple years. The year 2000 was  used to select the group because the primary purpose of this group is  comparison of investment returns for plans that are similarly situated  at the beginning of the period being analyzed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Calculations of Annual Investment Returns", "paragraphs": ["Our calculation of investment returns is based on the investment return  calculation expressed in the Form 5500 instructions for the Schedule MB.

(The  current value is the same as the fair market value\u2014see line 1b(1)  instructions.) For this purpose, the rate of return is determined by  using the formula 2I/(A + B \u2013 I), where I is the dollar amount of the  investment return, A is the current value of the assets 1 year ago,  and B is the current value of the assets on the current valuation  date. Enter rates to the nearest .1 percent.

Additionally, we made adjustments for the timing of cash flows,  to the extent indicated by the data. For example, employer and employee  contributions that were considered receivable at the end of the prior year  and thus included in the Schedule MB calculation were instead included  in the year when the plan received the cash for the contribution. Thus, our  calculation of annual rate of return is expressed as line items of the 2014  Schedule H to be:  2 *  / [[{item1(f)a} \u2013 {item  1(b)1(a)} - {item 1(b)2(a)} - {item 1j(a)}] + [{item1(f)b} \u2013 {item  1(b)1(b)} - {item 1(b)2(b)} - {item 1j(b)}] \u2013 [{item 2d} - {item 2a(3)} \u2013  {item 2c}]]  Or expressed with expository names as:  (2 * (TLINCOME - TOTLCON - OTHERINCOMEW)) /  ((TASSTSBY - (ERCONBOY + EECONBOY +  OTHER_LIAB_BOY_AMT)) + (TASSTSEY - (ERCONEOY +  EECONEOY + OTHER_LIAB_EOY_AMT)) - (TLINCOME -  TOTLCON - OTHERINCOMEW))", "For purposes of data reliability and validation of our results, we ran  permutations of the calculation to see how, if at all, certain items could  influence the calculation. In two permutations, we changed the timing of  net asset transfers to or from other plans. (This occurs when, for  example, there is a plan merger.) A senior actuary determined whether  the calculations with/without net asset transfers affected our calculation. If  the timing of the net transfer caused the investment return calculation to  vary by more than 0.1 percent, we excluded the data for that particular  plan in that particular year. We also ran another calculation that did not  include \u201cother\u201d income so we could estimate the impact of not adjusting  for such information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Calculation of Average Investment Return over Multiple Years", "paragraphs": ["Historical average investment returns over multiple years can be  calculated in at least two different ways.

We used a  market value of plan assets for this purpose. The dollar-weighted average  captures the impact of negative cash flow on average investment return.
