The security of these systems and data is vital to public  confidence and national security, prosperity, and well-being.", "Many of these systems contain vast amounts of personally identifiable  information (PII), thus making it imperative to protect the confidentiality,  integrity, and availability of this information and effectively respond to data  breaches and security incidents, when they occur. Underscoring the  importance of this issue, we continue to designate information security as a government-wide high-risk area in our most recent biennial report to  Congress\u2014a designation we have made in each report since 1997.", "The risks to IT systems supporting the federal government and the  nation\u2019s critical infrastructure are increasing as security threats continue  to evolve and become more sophisticated. These risks include insider  threats from witting or unwitting employees, escalating and emerging  threats from around the globe, steady advances in the sophistication of  attack technology, and the emergence of new and more destructive  attacks.", "In particular, foreign nations\u2014where adversaries may possess  sophisticated levels of expertise and significant resources to pursue their  objectives\u2014pose increasing risks. Rapid developments in new  technologies, such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things  (IoT), makes the threat landscape even more complex and can also  potentially introduce security, privacy, and safety issues that were  previously unknown.", "Compounding these risks, IT systems are often riddled with security  vulnerabilities\u2014both known and unknown. These vulnerabilities can  facilitate security incidents and cyberattacks that disrupt critical  operations; lead to inappropriate access to and disclosure, modification,  or destruction of sensitive information; and threaten national security,  economic well-being, and public health and safety. This is illustrated by  significant security breaches reported by the Office of Personnel  Management (OPM) in 2015 that resulted in the loss of PII for an  estimated 22.1 million individuals and, more recently, in 2017, a security  breach reported by Equifax\u2014one of the nation\u2019s largest credit bureaus\u2014 that resulted in the loss of PII for an estimated 148 million U.S.  consumers.", "This report provides an update to the information security high-risk area  by identifying actions that the federal government and other entities need  to take to address cybersecurity challenges facing the nation. To do so,  this report reflects work we conducted since the prior high-risk update  was issued in February 2017, among other things. We also plan to issue  an updated assessment of this high-risk area in February 2019.", "In conducting the work for this update, we first identified cybersecurity  areas in which the federal government has experienced challenges. To  do so, we primarily reviewed our prior work issued since the start of fiscal  year 2016 related to privacy, critical federal functions, and cybersecurity  incidents, among other areas (see appendix I for a list of our prior work).", "We also reviewed recent cybersecurity policy and strategy documents  issued by the current administration, such as Executive Order 13800,  Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical  Infrastructure; the National Security Strategy; and the Department of  Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) May 2018 cybersecurity strategy. We then  analyzed these documents to determine the extent to which they included  GAO\u2019s desirable characteristics of a national strategy. We also reviewed  recent media and information security industry reports of cyberattacks  and security breaches. Based on these actions, we identified four  cybersecurity areas in which federal agencies had experienced  challenges.", "To identify the actions needed to address each challenge area, we  reviewed the findings of our work specific to each challenge, the status of  our prior recommendations to the Executive Office of the President and  federal agencies, and any actions taken by these entities to address our  recommendations. In reviewing the status of prior recommendations, we  also determined which recommendations had not been implemented and  what additional actions, if any, the Executive Office of the President and  federal agencies needed to take in order to address them. We then  summarized the actions needed and the status of our prior  recommendations. We also identified our ongoing work related to each  action.", "We performed our work at the initiative of the U.S. Comptroller General.  We conducted this performance audit from February 2018 to September  2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["IT systems supporting federal agencies and our nation\u2019s critical  infrastructures are inherently at risk. These systems are highly complex  and dynamic, technologically diverse, and often geographically dispersed.  This complexity increases the difficulty in identifying, managing, and  protecting the numerous operating systems, applications, and devices  comprising the systems and networks.", "Compounding the risk, federal systems and networks are also often  interconnected with other internal and external systems and networks,  including the Internet. This increases the number of avenues of attack  and expands their attack surface. As systems become more integrated,  cyber threats will pose an increasing risk to national security, economic  well-being, and public health and safety.", "Advancements in technology, such as data analytics software for  searching and collecting information, have also made it easier for  individuals and organizations to correlate data (including PII) and track it  across large and numerous databases. For example, social media has  been used as a mass communication tool where PII can be gathered in  vast amounts. In addition, ubiquitous Internet and cellular connectivity  makes it easier to track individuals by allowing easy access to information  pinpointing their locations. These advances\u2014combined with the  increasing sophistication of hackers and others with malicious intent, and  the extent to which both federal agencies and private companies collect  sensitive information about individuals\u2014have increased the risk of PII  being exposed and compromised.", "Cybersecurity incidents continue to impact entities across various critical  infrastructure sectors. For example, in its 2018 annual data breach  investigations report, Verizon reported that 53,308 security incidents  and 2,216 data breaches were identified across 65 countries in the 12  months since its prior report. Further, the report noted that cybercriminals  can often compromise a system in just a matter of minutes\u2014or even  seconds, but that it can take an organization significantly longer to  discover the breach. Specifically, the report stated nearly 90 percent of  the reported breaches occurred within minutes, while nearly 70 percent  went undiscovered for months.", "These concerns are further highlighted by the number of information  security incidents reported by federal executive branch civilian agencies  to DHS\u2019s U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT). For  fiscal year 2017, 35,277 such incidents were reported by the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) in its 2018 annual report to Congress,  as mandated by the Federal Information Security Modernization Act  (FISMA). These incidents include, for example, web-based attacks,  phishing, and the loss or theft of computing equipment.", "Different types of incidents merit different response strategies. However,  if an agency cannot identify the threat vector (or avenue of attack), it  could be difficult for that agency to define more specific handling  procedures to respond to the incident and take actions to minimize similar  future attacks. In this regard, incidents with a threat vector categorized as  \u201cother\u201d (which includes avenues of attacks that are unidentified) made up  31 percent of the various incidents reported to US-CERT. Figure 1 shows  the percentage of the different types of incidents reported across each of  the nine threat vector categories for fiscal year 2017, as reported by  OMB.", "These incidents and others like them can pose a serious challenge to  economic, national, and personal privacy and security. The following  examples highlight the impact of such incidents:  In March 2018, the Mayor of Atlanta, Georgia, reported that the city  was victimized by a ransomware cyberattack. As a result, city  government officials stated that customers were not able to access  multiple applications that are used to pay bills or access court related  information. In response to the attack, the officials noted that they  were working with numerous private and governmental partners,  including DHS, to assess what occurred and determine how best to  protect the city from future attacks.", "In March 2018, the Department of Justice reported that it had indicted  nine Iranians for conducting a massive cybersecurity theft campaign  on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. According to the  department, the nine Iranians allegedly stole more than 31 terabytes  of documents and data from more than 140 American universities, 30  U.S. companies, and five federal government agencies, among other  entities.", "In March 2018, a joint alert from DHS and the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI) stated that, since at least March 2016, Russian  government actors had targeted the systems of multiple U.S.  government entities and critical infrastructure sectors. Specifically, the  alert stated that Russian government actors had affected multiple  organizations in the energy, nuclear, water, aviation, construction, and  critical manufacturing sectors.", "In July 2017, a breach at Equifax resulted in the loss of PII for an  estimated 148 million U.S. consumers. According to Equifax, the  hackers accessed people\u2019s names, Social Security numbers (SSN),  birth dates, addresses and, in some instances, driver\u2019s license  numbers.", "In April 2017, the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service  (IRS) testified that the IRS had disabled its data retrieval tool in early  March 2017 after becoming concerned about the misuse of taxpayer  data. Specifically, the agency suspected that PII obtained outside the  agency\u2019s tax system was used to access the agency\u2019s online federal  student aid application in an attempt to secure tax information through  the data retrieval tool. In April 2017, the agency began notifying  taxpayers who could have been affected by the breach.", "In June 2015, OPM reported that an intrusion into its systems had  affected the personnel records of about 4.2 million current and former  federal employees. Then, in July 2015, the agency reported that a  separate, but related, incident had compromised its systems and the  files related to background investigations for 21.5 million individuals.

Due to  increasing cyber-based threats and the persistent nature of information  security vulnerabilities, we have designated information security as a  government-wide high-risk area since 1997. In 2003, we expanded the  information security high-risk area to include the protection of critical  cyber infrastructure. At that time, we highlighted the need to manage  critical infrastructure protection activities that enhance the security of the  cyber and physical public and private infrastructures that are essential to  national security, national economic security, and/or national public health  and safety.", "We further expanded the information security high-risk area in 2015 to  include protecting the privacy of PII. Since then, advances in technology  have enhanced the ability of government and private sector entities to  collect and process extensive amounts of PII, which has posed  challenges to ensuring the privacy of such information. In addition, high- profile PII breaches at commercial entities, such as Equifax, heightened  concerns that personal privacy is not being adequately protected.", "Our experience has shown that the key elements needed to make  progress toward being removed from the High-Risk List are top-level  attention by the administration and agency leaders grounded in the five  criteria for removal, as well as any needed congressional action. The five  criteria for removal that we identified in November 2000 are as follows:", "Leadership Commitment. Demonstrated strong commitment and top  leadership support.", "Capacity. The agency has the capacity (i.e., people and resources) to  resolve the risk(s).", "Action Plan. A corrective action plan exists that defines the root  cause, solutions, and provides for substantially completing corrective  measures, including steps necessary to implement solutions we  recommended.", "Monitoring. A program has been instituted to monitor and  independently validate the effectiveness and sustainability of  corrective measures.", "Demonstrated Progress. Ability to demonstrate progress in  implementing corrective measures and in resolving the high-risk area.", "These five criteria form a road map for efforts to improve and ultimately  address high-risk issues. Addressing some of the criteria leads to  progress, while satisfying all of the criteria is central to removal from the  list. Figure 2 shows the five criteria and illustrative actions taken by  agencies to address the criteria. Importantly, the actions listed are not  \u201cstand alone\u201d efforts taken in isolation from other actions to address high- risk issues. That is, actions taken under one criterion may be important to  meeting other criteria as well. For example, top leadership can  demonstrate its commitment by establishing a corrective action plan  including long-term priorities and goals to address the high-risk issue and  using data to gauge progress\u2014actions which are also vital to monitoring  criteria.", "As we reported in the February 2017 high-risk report, the federal  government\u2019s efforts to address information security deficiencies had fully  met one of the five criteria for removal from the High-Risk List\u2014 leadership commitment\u2014and partially met the other four, as shown in  figure 3.

To address these challenges, we have  identified 10 critical actions that the federal government and other entities  need to take (see figure 4). The four challenges and the 10 actions  needed to address them are summarized following the table. In addition,  we also discuss in more detail each of the 10 actions in appendices II  through XI."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Establishing a Comprehensive Cybersecurity Strategy and Performing Effective Oversight", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has been challenged in establishing a  comprehensive cybersecurity strategy and in performing effective  oversight as called for by federal law and policy. Specifically, we have  previously reported that the federal government has faced challenges in  establishing a comprehensive strategy to provide a framework for how the  United States will engage both domestically and internationally on  cybersecurity related matters. We have also reported on challenges in  performing oversight, including monitoring the global supply chain,  ensuring a highly skilled cyber workforce, and addressing risks  associated with emerging technologies. The federal government can take  four key actions to improve the nation\u2019s strategic approach to, and  oversight of, cybersecurity.", "Develop and execute a more comprehensive federal strategy for  national cybersecurity and global cyberspace. In February 2013  we reported that the government had issued a variety of strategy- related documents that addressed priorities for enhancing  cybersecurity within the federal government as well as for  encouraging improvements in the cybersecurity of critical  infrastructure within the private sector; however, no overarching  cybersecurity strategy had been developed that articulated priority  actions, assigned responsibilities for performing them, and set time  frames for their completion.", "In October 2015, in response to our recommendation to develop an  overarching federal cybersecurity strategy that included all key  elements of the desirable characteristics of a national strategy, the  Director of OMB and the Federal Chief Information Officer issued a  Cybersecurity Strategy and Implementation Plan for the Federal  Civilian Government. The plan directed a series of actions to  improve capabilities for identifying and detecting vulnerabilities and  threats, enhance protections of government assets and information,  and further develop robust response and recovery capabilities to  ensure readiness and resilience when incidents inevitably occur. The  plan also identified key milestones for major activities, resources  needed to accomplish milestones, and specific roles and  responsibilities of federal organizations related to the strategy\u2019s  milestones.", "Since that time, the executive branch has made progress toward  outlining a federal strategy for confronting cyber threats. For example,  a May 2017 presidential executive order required federal agencies to  take a variety of actions, including better manage their cybersecurity  risks and coordinate to meet reporting requirements related to  cybersecurity of federal networks, critical infrastructure, and the  nation. Additionally, the December 2017 National Security Strategy  cites cybersecurity as a national priority and identifies related needed  actions, such as including identifying and prioritizing risk, and building  defensible government networks.", "Further, DHS issued a cybersecurity strategy in May 2018, which  articulated seven goals the department plans to accomplish in support  of its mission related to managing national cybersecurity risks. The  strategy is intended to provide DHS with a framework to execute its  cybersecurity responsibilities during the next 5 years to keep pace  with the evolving cyber risk landscape by reducing vulnerabilities and  building resilience; countering malicious actors in cyberspace;  responding to incidents; and making the cyber ecosystem more  secure and resilient.", "These efforts provide a good foundation toward establishing a more  comprehensive strategy, but more effort is needed to address all of  the desirable characteristics of a national strategy that we have  previously recommended. The recently issued executive branch  strategy documents did not include key elements of desirable  characteristics that can enhance the usefulness of a national strategy  as guidance for decision makers in allocating resources, defining  policies, and helping to ensure accountability. Specifically, the  documents generally did not include milestones and performance  measures to gauge results, nor did they describe the resources  needed to carry out the goals and objective. Further, most of the  strategy documents lacked clearly defined roles and responsibilities  for key agencies, such as DHS, the Department of Defense (DOD),  and OMB, who contribute substantially to the nation\u2019s cybersecurity  programs.", "Ultimately, a more clearly defined, coordinated, and comprehensive  approach to planning and executing an overall strategy would likely  lead to significant progress in furthering strategic goals and lessening  persistent weaknesses. For more information on this action area, see  appendix II.", "Mitigate global supply chain risks. The global, geographically  disperse nature of the producers and suppliers of IT products is a  growing concern. We have previously reported on potential issues  associated with IT supply chain and risks originating from foreign- manufactured equipment. For example, in July 2017, we reported that  the Department of State had relied on certain device manufacturers,  software developers, and contractor support which had suppliers that  were reported to be headquartered in a cyber-threat nation (e.g.,  China and Russia). We further pointed out that the reliance on  complex, global IT supply chains introduces multiple risks to federal  agencies, including insertion of counterfeits, tampering, or installation  of malicious software or hardware.", "In July 2018, we testified that if such global IT supply chain risks are  realized, they could jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, and  availability of federal information systems. Thus, the potential exists  for serious adverse impact on an agency\u2019s operations, assets, and  employees. These factors highlight the importance and urgency of  federal agencies appropriately assessing, managing, and monitoring  IT supply chain risk as part of their agency-wide information security  programs. For more information on this action area, see appendix III.", "Address cybersecurity workforce management challenges. The  federal government faces challenges in ensuring that the nation\u2019s  cybersecurity workforce has the appropriate skills. For example, in  June 2018, we reported on federal efforts to implement the  requirements of the Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act  of 2015. We determined that most of the Chief Financial Officers  (CFO) Act agencies had not fully implemented all statutory  requirements, such as developing procedures for assigning codes to  cybersecurity positions. Further, we have previously reported that  DHS and DOD had not addressed cybersecurity workforce  management requirements set forth in federal laws. In addition, we  have reported in the last 2 years that federal agencies (1) had not  identified and closed cybersecurity skills gaps, (2) had been  challenged with recruiting and retaining qualified staff, and (3) had  difficulty navigating the federal hiring process.", "A recent executive branch report also discussed challenges  associated with the cybersecurity workforce. Specifically, in response  to Executive Order 13800, the Department of Commerce and DHS led  an interagency working group exploring how to support the growth  and sustainment of future cybersecurity employees in the public and  private sectors. In May 2018, the departments issued a report that  identified key findings, including:  the U.S. cybersecurity workforce needs immediate and sustained  improvements;  the pool of cybersecurity candidates needs to be expanded  through retraining and by increasing the participation of women,  minorities, and veterans; a shortage exists of cybersecurity teachers at the primary and  secondary levels, faculty in higher education, and training  instructors; and  comprehensive and reliable data about cybersecurity workforce  position needs and education and training programs are lacking.", "The report also included recommendations and proposed actions to  address the findings, including that private and public sectors should  (1) align education and training with employers\u2019 cybersecurity  workforce needs by applying the National Initiative for Cybersecurity  Education Cybersecurity Workforce Framework; (2) develop  cybersecurity career model paths; and (3) establish a clearinghouse  of information on cybersecurity workforce development education,  training, and workforce development programs and initiatives.", "In addition, in June 2018, the executive branch issued a government  reform plan and reorganization recommendations that included,  among other things, proposals for solving the federal cybersecurity  workforce shortage. In particular, the plan notes that the  administration intends to prioritize and accelerate ongoing efforts to  reform the way that the federal government recruits, evaluates,  selects, pays, and places cyber talent across the enterprise. The plan  further states that, by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, all  CFO Act agencies, in coordination with DHS and OMB, are to develop  a critical list of vacancies across their organizations. Subsequently,  OMB and DHS are to analyze these lists and work with OPM to  develop a government-wide approach to identifying or recruiting new  employees or reskilling existing employees. Regarding cybersecurity  training, the plan notes that OMB is to consult with DHS to  standardize training for cybersecurity employees, and should work to  develop an enterprise-wide training process for government  cybersecurity employees. For more information on this action area,  see appendix IV.", "Ensure the security of emerging technologies. As the devices  used in daily life become increasingly integrated with technology, the  risk to sensitive data and PII also grows. Over the last several years,  we have reported on weaknesses in addressing vulnerabilities  associated with emerging technologies, including:  IoT devices, such as fitness trackers, cameras, and thermostats,  that continuously collect and process information are potentially  vulnerable to cyber-attacks;  IoT devices, such as those acquired and used by DOD employees  or that DOD itself acquires (e.g., smartphones), may increase the  security risks to the department;  vehicles that are potentially susceptible to cyber-attack through  technology, such as Bluetooth;  the unknown impact of artificial intelligence cybersecurity; and advances in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies.", "Executive branch agencies have also highlighted the challenges  associated with ensuring the security of emerging technologies.  Specifically, in a May 2018 report issued in response to Executive  Order 13800, the Department of Commerce and DHS issued a report  on the opportunities and challenges in reducing the botnet threat.  The opportunities and challenges are centered on six principal  themes, including the global nature of automated, distributed attacks;  effective tools; and awareness and education. The report also  provides recommended actions, including that federal agencies  should increase their understanding of what software components  have been incorporated into acquired products and establish a public  campaign to support awareness of IoT security. For more information  on this action area, see appendix V.", "In our previously discussed reports related to this cybersecurity  challenge, we made a total of 50 recommendations to federal agencies to  address the weaknesses identified. As of August 2018, 48  recommendations had not been implemented. These outstanding  recommendations include 8 priority recommendations, meaning that we  believe that they warrant priority attention from heads of key departments  and agencies. These priority recommendations include addressing  weaknesses associated with, among other things, agency-specific  cybersecurity workforce challenges and agency responsibilities for  supporting mitigation of vehicle network attacks. Until our  recommendations are fully implemented, federal agencies may be limited  in their ability to provide effective oversight of critical government-wide  initiatives, address challenges with cybersecurity workforce management,  and better ensure the security of emerging technologies.", "In addition to our prior work related to the federal government\u2019s efforts to  establish key strategy documents and implement effective oversight, we  also have several ongoing reviews related to this challenge. These  include reviews of:  the CFO Act agencies\u2019 efforts to submit complete and reliable  baseline assessment reports of their cybersecurity workforces;  the extent to which DOD has established training standards for cyber  mission force personnel, and efforts the department has made to  achieve its goal of a trained cyber mission force; and  selected agencies\u2019 ability to implement cloud service technologies and  notable benefits this might have on agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Securing Federal Systems and Information", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has been challenged in securing federal systems  and information.

As such, it is important that federal agencies take appropriate  steps to better ensure they have effectively implemented programs to  protect their information and systems. We have identified three actions  that the agencies can take.", "Improve implementation of government-wide cybersecurity  initiatives. Specifically, in January 2016, we reported that DHS had  not ensured that the National Cybersecurity Protection System  (NCPS) had fully satisfied all intended system objectives related to  intrusion detection and prevention, information sharing, and  analytics. In addition, in February 2017, we reported that the DHS  National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center\u2019s  (NCCIC) functions were not being performed in adherence with the  principles set forth in federal laws. We noted that, although NCCIC  was sharing information about cyber threats in the way it should, the  center did not have metrics to measure that the information was  timely, relevant and actionable, as prescribed by law.

The recently issued executive branch strategy documents did not include  key elements of desirable characteristics that can enhance the usefulness  of a national strategy as guidance for decision makers in allocating  resources, defining policies, and helping to ensure accountability.  Specifically:", "Milestones and performance measures to gauge results were  generally not included in strategy documents. For example, although  the DHS Cybersecurity Strategy stated that its implementation would  be assessed on an annual basis, it did not describe the milestones  and performance measures for tracking the effectiveness of the  activities intended to meet the stated goals (e.g., protecting critical  infrastructure and responding effectively to cyber incidents). Without  such performance measures, DHS will lack a means to ensure that  the goals and objectives discussed in the document are accomplished  and that responsible parties are held accountable.", "According to officials from DHS\u2019s Office of Cybersecurity and  Communications, the department is developing a plan for  implementing the DHS Cybersecurity Strategy and expects to issue  the plan by the end of calendar year 2018.

However, we found that the results of these  assessments may not have been reliable because agencies did not  address all of the reportable information and agencies were limited in  their ability to obtain complete and consistent information about their  cybersecurity employees and the certifications they held. We  determined that this was because agencies had not yet fully identified  all members of their cybersecurity workforces or did not have a  consistent list of appropriate certifications for cybersecurity positions.", "Further, 23 of the agencies reviewed had established procedures for  identifying and assigning the appropriate employment codes to their  civilian cybersecurity positions, as called for by the act. However, 6 of  the 23 did not address one or more of 7 activities required by OPM in  their procedures, such as reviewing all filled and vacant positions and  annotating reviewed position descriptions with the appropriate  employment code. Accordingly, we made 30 recommendations to 13  agencies to fully implement two of the act\u2019s requirements on baseline  assessments and coding procedures. The extent to which these  agencies agreed with the recommendations varied.", "DHS and the Department of Defense (DOD) had not addressed  cybersecurity workforce management requirements set forth in  federal laws. In February 2018, we reported that, while DHS had  taken actions to identify, categorize, and assign employment codes to  its cybersecurity positions, as required by the Homeland Security  Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014, its actions were  not timely and complete. For example, DHS did not establish timely  and complete procedures to identify, categorize, and code its  cybersecurity position vacancies and responsibilities. Further, DHS  had not yet completed its efforts to identify all of its cybersecurity  positions and accurately assign codes to all filled and vacant  cybersecurity positions. Table 2 shows DHS\u2019s progress in  implementing the requirements of the Homeland Security  Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014, as of December  2017.", "Accordingly, we recommended that DHS take six actions, including  ensuring that its cybersecurity workforce procedures identify position  vacancies and responsibilities; reported workforce data are complete  and accurate; and plans for reporting on critical needs are developed.  DHS agreed with our six recommendations, but had not implemented  them as of August 2018.", "Regarding DOD, in November 2017, we reported that instead of  developing a comprehensive plan for U.S. Cyber Command, the  department submitted a report consisting of a collection of documents  that did not fully address the required six elements set forth in Section  1648 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016.  More specifically, DOD\u2019s 1648 report did not address an element  related to cyber incident training. In addition to not addressing the  training element in the report, DOD had not ensured that staff were  trained as required by the Presidential Policy Directive on United  States Cyber Incident Coordination or DOD\u2019s Significant Cyber  Incident Coordination Procedures.", "Accordingly, we made two recommendations to DOD to address  these issues. DOD agreed with one of the recommendations and  partially agreed with the other, citing ongoing activities related to  cyber incident coordination training it believed were sufficient.

Accordingly, we made a total of five recommendations to  the agencies to address these issues. Four agencies agreed and one,  DOD, partially agreed with our recommendations citing progress  made in improving its IT workforce planning. However, we continued  to believe our recommendation was warranted. As of August 2018, all  five of the recommendations had not been implemented.", "Agencies had been challenged with recruiting and retaining  qualified staff. In August 2016, we reported on the current authorities  chief information security officers (CISO) at 24 agencies. Among  other things, CISOs identified key challenges they faced in fulfilling  their responsibilities. Several of these challenges were related to the  cybersecurity workforce, such as not having enough personnel to  oversee the implementation of the number and scope of security  requirements. In addition, CISOs stated that they were not able to  offer salaries that were competitive with the private sector for  candidates with high-demand technical skills. Furthermore, CISOs  stated that certain security personnel lacked the skill sets needed or  were not sufficiently trained. To assist CISOs in carrying out their  responsibilities and better define their roles, we made a total of 34  recommendations to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  and 13 agencies in our review. Agency responses to the  recommendations varied; as of August 2018, 18 of the 34  recommendations had not been implemented.", "Agencies have had difficulty navigating the federal hiring  process. In August 2016, we reported on the extent to which federal  hiring authorities were meeting agency needs. Although competitive  hiring has been the traditional method of hiring, agencies can use  additional hiring authorities to expedite the hiring process or achieve  certain public policy goals. Among other things, we noted that  agencies rely on a relatively small number of hiring authorities (as  established by law, executive order, or regulation) to fill the vast  majority of hires into the federal civil service.", "Further, while OPM collects a variety of data to assess the federal  hiring process, neither it nor agencies used this information to assess  the effectiveness of hiring authorities.

In particular, domestic violence groups stated that  additional education of law enforcement officials and consumers  about how to protect against, detect, and remove tracking apps is  needed.", "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has not ensured  privacy and accuracy related to the use of face recognition  technology. In May 2016, we reported that the Department of  Justice had not been timely in publishing and updating privacy  documentation for the FBI\u2019s use of face recognition technology.  Publishing such documents in a timely manner would better assure  the public that the FBI is evaluating risks to privacy when  implementing systems. Also, the FBI had taken limited steps to  determine whether the face recognition system it was using was  sufficiently accurate. We recommended that the department ensure  required privacy-related documents are published and that the FBI  test and review face recognition systems to ensure that they are  sufficiently accurate. Of the six recommendations we made, the  Department of Justice agreed with one, partially agreed with two, and  disagreed with three. We continued to believe all the  recommendations made were valid. As of August 2018, the six  recommendations had not been implemented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XII: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contacts named above, Jon Ticehurst, Assistant  Director; Kush K.
