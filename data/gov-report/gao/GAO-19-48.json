Interstate pipelines run through remote areas and highly populated urban areas, and are vulnerable to accidents, operating errors, and malicious physical and cyber-based attack or intrusion. The energy sector accounted for 35 percent of the 796 critical infrastructure cyber incidents reported to DHS from 2013 to 2015. Several federal and private entities have roles in pipeline security. TSA is primarily responsible for the oversight of pipeline physical security and cybersecurity.", "GAO was asked to review TSA's efforts to assess and enhance pipeline security and cybersecurity. This report examines, among other objectives: (1) the guidance pipeline operators reported using to address security risks and the extent that TSA ensures its guidelines reflect the current threat environment; (2) the extent that TSA has assessed pipeline systems' security risks; and (3) the extent TSA has assessed its effectiveness in reducing pipeline security risks.", "GAO analyzed TSA documents, such as its Pipeline Security Guidelines ; evaluated TSA pipeline risk assessment efforts; and interviewed TSA officials, 10 U.S. pipeline operators\u2014selected based on volume, geography, and material transported\u2014and representatives from five industry associations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Pipeline operators reported using a range of guidelines and standards to address physical and cybersecurity risks, including the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) Pipeline Security Guidelines , initially issued in 2011. TSA issued revised guidelines in March 2018 to reflect changes in the threat environment and incorporate most of the principles and practices from the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity . However, TSA's revisions do not include all elements of the current framework and TSA does not have a documented process for reviewing and revising its guidelines on a regular basis. Without such a documented process, TSA cannot ensure that its guidelines reflect the latest known standards and best practices for physical security and cybersecurity, or address the dynamic security threat environment that pipelines face. Further, GAO found that the guidelines lack clear definitions to ensure that pipeline operators identify their critical facilities. GAO's analysis showed that operators of at least 34 of the nation's top 100 critical pipeline systems (determined by volume of product transported) deemed highest risk had identified no critical facilities. This may be due, in part, to the guidelines not clearly defining the criteria to determine facilities' criticality.", "To assess pipeline security risks, TSA conducts pipeline security reviews\u2014Corporate Security Reviews and Critical Facility Security Reviews\u2014to assess pipeline systems' vulnerabilities. However, GAO found that the number of TSA security reviews has varied considerably over the last several years, as shown in the table on the following page.", "TSA officials stated that staffing limitations have prevented TSA from conducting more reviews. Staffing levels for TSA's Pipeline Security Branch have varied significantly since fiscal year 2010 with the number of staff ranging from 14 full-time equivalents in fiscal years 2012 and 2013 to 1 in 2014. Further, TSA does not have a strategic workforce plan to help ensure it identifies the skills and competencies\u2014such as the required level of cybersecurity expertise\u2014necessary to carry out its pipeline security responsibilities. By establishing a strategic workforce plan, TSA can help ensure that it has identified the necessary skills, competencies, and staffing.", "GAO also identified factors that likely limit the usefulness of TSA's risk assessment methodology for prioritizing pipeline system reviews. Specifically, TSA has not updated its risk assessment methodology since 2014 to reflect current threats to the pipeline industry. Further, its sources of data and underlying assumptions and judgments regarding certain threat and vulnerability inputs are not fully documented. In addition, the risk assessment has not been peer reviewed since its inception in 2007. Taking steps to strengthen its risk assessment, and initiating an independent, external peer review would provide greater assurance that TSA ranks relative risk among pipeline systems using comprehensive and accurate data and methods.", "TSA has established performance measures to monitor pipeline security review recommendations, analyze their results, and assess effectiveness in reducing risks. However, these measures do not possess key attributes\u2014such as clarity, and having measurable targets\u2014that GAO has found are key to successful performance measures. By taking steps to ensure that its pipeline security program performance measures exhibit these key attributes, TSA could better assess its effectiveness at reducing pipeline systems' security risks. Pipeline Security Branch officials also reported conducting security reviews as the primary means for assessing the effectiveness of TSA's efforts to reduce pipeline security risks. However, TSA has not tracked the status of Corporate Security Review recommendations for the past 5 years. Until TSA monitors and records the status of these reviews' recommendations, it will be hindered in its efforts to determine whether its recommendations are leading to significant reduction in risk."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes 10 recommendations to TSA to improve its pipeline security program management (many are listed on the next page), and DHS concurred.", "GAO recommends, among other things, that the TSA Administrator take the following actions:", "implement a documented process for reviewing, and if deemed necessary, for revising TSA's Pipeline Security Guidelines at defined intervals;", "clarify TSA's Pipeline Security Guidelines by defining key terms within its criteria for determining critical facilities;", "develop a strategic workforce plan for TSA's Security Policy and Industry Engagement\u2018s Surface Division;", "update TSA's pipeline risk assessment methodology to include current data to ensure it reflects industry conditions and threats;", "fully document the data sources, underlying assumptions and judgments that form the basis of TSA's pipeline risk assessment methodology;", "take steps to coordinate an independent, external peer review of TSA's pipeline risk assessment methodology;", "ensure the Security Policy and Industry Engagement\u2018s Surface Division has a suite of performance measures which exhibit key attributes of successful performance measures; and", "enter information on Corporate Security Review recommendations and monitor and record their status."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The security of the nation\u2019s pipeline systems is vital to public confidence  and the nation\u2019s safety, prosperity, and well-being.

The interstate pipeline system runs through  remote, as well as highly populated urban areas, and is vulnerable to  accidents, operating errors, and malicious attacks. In addition, pipelines  increasingly rely on sophisticated networked computerized systems and  electronic data, which are vulnerable to cyber attack or intrusion.", "Given that many pipelines transport volatile, flammable, or toxic oil and  liquids, and given the potential consequences of a successful physical or  cyber attack on life, property, the economy, and the environment, pipeline  systems are attractive targets for terrorists, hackers, foreign nations,  criminal groups, and others with malicious intent. For example, according  to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA)\u2014the federal agency  with responsibility for security in all modes of transportation, which  includes the oversight of pipeline physical security and cybersecurity\u2014a  minor pipeline system disruption could result in commodity price  increases while prolonged pipeline disruptions could lead to widespread  energy shortages. Further, disruption of any magnitude may affect other  domestic critical infrastructure and industries that are dependent on  pipeline system commodities.", "Since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, new threats to the  nation\u2019s pipeline systems have evolved to include sabotage by  environmental activists and cyber attack or intrusion by nations. In  October 2016, environmental activists forced the shutdown of five crude  oil pipelines in four states. In addition, the U.S. energy sector has  experienced cyber intrusions by nation-state actors into their networks.  For example, in March 2018, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the  National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC)  reported that a nation-state had targeted organizations within multiple  U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy sector, and  collected information pertaining to Industrial Control Systems (ICS). Also,  in April 2012, the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response  Team reported that an unidentified cyber attacker had conducted a series  of cyber intrusions into U.S. natural gas pipeline systems beginning in  December 2011.", "The security of federal cyber assets has been on our High Risk list since  1997 and was expanded to include the protection of critical cyber  infrastructure in 2003. In September 2018, we issued an update to the  information security high-risk area that identified actions needed to  address cybersecurity challenges facing the nation. We last reported on  pipeline security in 2010 and made eight recommendations to TSA to  develop outcome-based performance measures for assessing TSA\u2019s  pipeline security efforts, and to track its corporate security reviews and  critical facility inspections\u2019 recommendations, among others. We  discuss some of these recommendations in more detail later in this report.  In 2012, we reviewed information provided by TSA and closed the  recommendations as implemented.", "You requested that we review TSA\u2019s efforts to enhance pipeline physical  security and cybersecurity. This report examines the following objectives:  1.  how do pipeline sector stakeholders share security-related  2.  what guidance do pipeline operators report using to address security  risks and to what extent does TSA ensure its guidelines reflect the  current threat environment;  3.  to what extent has TSA assessed security risks to pipeline systems;  4.  to what extent has TSA assessed its effectiveness in reducing  pipeline security risks.", "For each objective, we interviewed representatives of the five major  associations with ties to the pipeline industry: the American Petroleum  Institute (API), the Association of Oil Pipe Lines, the American Gas  Association (AGA), the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America  (INGAA), and the American Public Gas Association. We also interviewed  a nonprobability sample of security personnel from 10 pipeline operators.  We selected the 10 pipeline operators from TSA\u2019s list of the top 100  critical pipeline systems. We chose operators to ensure a mixture of the  following characteristics: (a) type of pipeline commodity transported (i.e.,  natural gas or hazardous oil and liquids); (b) volume of product  transported; and (c) whether or not the pipeline operators\u2019 critical facilities  had been the subject of a TSA security review. We also considered the  location of selected operators\u2019 pipeline systems to ensure that a single  state or region was not overrepresented in our sample. We then  conducted semistructured interviews to obtain operators\u2019 perspectives on  pipeline security and the role of federal agencies in assisting operators  with security activities. While the information gathered during operator  interviews cannot be generalized to all pipeline operators, it provides a  range of perspectives on a variety of topics relevant to pipeline security.", "To identify how pipeline sector stakeholders share security-related  information, we reviewed documents describing federal agencies\u2019  processes for sharing security-related information with federal partners  and private industry. In addition, we reviewed relevant documents from  TSA and other federal entities, including the Department of  Transportation (DOT), DOT\u2019s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety  Administration (PHMSA), the Department of Energy (DOE), and the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). We also interviewed  agency and industry officials to gather their perspectives on how security  information is shared among pipeline sector stakeholders.", "To identify the guidance pipeline operators report using to address  security risks and the extent to which TSA ensures its guidelines reflect  the current threat environment, we reviewed TSA\u2019s 2018 Pipeline Security  Guidelines and compared the cybersecurity-related sections to  applicable standards of the National Institute of Standards and  Technology\u2019s (NIST) Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure  Cybersecurity. We also interviewed federal officials to identify security- related standards and guidance issued. In addition, we obtained from  industry officials the security-related standards and guidance they use  and asked them about any challenges they experienced in implementing TSA\u2019s Pipeline Security Guidelines. Based on the results of our operator  interviews, we analyzed TSA data on critical facility identification. Further,  to assess TSA\u2019s process for updating the guidelines, we compared the  process with TSA\u2019s Pipeline Security Smart Practice Observations for  pipeline operators and our Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government.", "To determine the extent TSA has assessed security risks to pipelines, we  reviewed key threat assessments from TSA, such as its Pipeline Modal  and Cyber Modal Threat Assessments and Transportation Sector  Security Risk Assessments that it issued during calendar years 2011  through 2017. We also evaluated TSA\u2019s identification of the 100 most  critical pipeline systems, its methods for assessing relative risk among  those systems, and its prioritization of its pipeline reviews. As part of that  evaluation, we assessed the reliability of the data within TSA\u2019s pipeline  relative risk ranking tool by performing electronic and manual checks for  such things as logic errors and missing data. Additionally, we  interviewed TSA officials about how the risk tool is updated and  maintained to ensure data reliability. We determined the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of our review. We also interviewed  TSA officials about the methods they used to rank relative risk among  pipeline systems and the extent to which those methods aligned with the  National Infrastructure Protection Plan 2013: Partnering for Critical  Infrastructure Security and Resilience (NIPP), other Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) priorities, and previously identified best  practices for program management and risk assessment. We also  analyzed information on the number of pipeline security reviews\u2014 Corporate Security Reviews (CSR) and Critical Facility Security Reviews  (CFSR)\u2014that TSA conducted by fiscal year, as well as TSA staffing  levels and contractor support. Further, we interviewed TSA officials about  their staffing allocation and workforce planning process and compared  TSA\u2019s process to our previous work which identified principles that a  strategic workforce planning process should follow.", "To further our understanding of TSA\u2019s pipeline security review processes,  we observed TSA officials and contractors conduct one CSR of one  pipeline system, and three CFSRs at three critical facilities in the Houston  and Beaumont, Texas, areas. While the results of our observations  cannot be generalized to all CSRs and CFSRs or all pipeline systems and  critical facilities, they provided us with an understanding of how TSA  conducts these reviews and inspections. We also interviewed  representatives of Secure Solutions International\u2014a security and risk  management consulting firm that assists TSA in conducting CSRs and  CFSRs\u2014about critical facilities and the inspection process.", "To determine the extent TSA has assessed its effectiveness in reducing  pipeline security risks, we assessed key strategic documents, such as  TSA\u2019s performance report, against our key characteristics of effective  performance measures. We also reviewed TSA guidance, such as the  standard operating procedures outlining how TSA staff are to conduct  pipeline security reviews and monitor operators\u2019 implementation of their  recommendations. We then compared TSA\u2019s assessment efforts to our  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government. In addition, we  evaluated the databases TSA officials reported using to analyze and  record the results and recommendations of pipeline security reviews. We  reviewed each database to determine what information was stored in  them, such as the number of observations, what fields were present, and  typical entries within each field. We then reviewed and conducted  electronic testing on the universe of fields and observations. Although we  identified limitations, which we discuss later in the report, we found that  the data was sufficiently reliable to provide general information such as  summary figures describing pipeline security reviews completed. We also  interviewed TSA officials to understand TSA\u2019s efforts to assess its overall  effectiveness in reducing pipeline security risks and related data  collection efforts.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2017 to December 2018  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Many pipeline systems are comprised of the  pipelines themselves, as well as a variety of facilities, such as storage  tanks, compressor stations, and control centers. Most pipeline systems  are monitored and moderated through automated ICS or Supervisory  Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems using remote sensors,  signals, and preprogramed parameters to activate and deactivate valves  and pumps to maintain flows within tolerances.", "Federal agencies and pipeline operators determine the criticality of  pipeline systems and their facilities based on their importance to the  nation\u2019s energy infrastructure; service to installations critical to national  defense; or, if attacked, have the potential to cause mass casualties and  significant impact on public drinking water affecting major population  centers. Accordingly, those determined to be critical merit increased  attention to security. However, as we previously reported, the inherent  design and operation of U.S. pipeline systems may reduce some potential  impacts of lost service. The pipeline sector is generally considered to be  resilient and versatile. Historically, pipeline operators have been able to  quickly respond to the adverse consequences of an incident\u2014whether it  is damage from a major hurricane or a backhoe\u2014and quickly restore  pipeline service. Pipeline infrastructure also includes redundancies such  as parallel pipelines or interconnections that enable operators to reroute  material through the network. Figure 2 depicts the U.S. pipeline system,  its basic components, examples of vulnerabilities, and the entities to  which it supplies energy and raw materials. These entities include utility  companies, airports, military sites, and industrial and manufacturing  facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Physical and Cyber Threats to Pipeline Systems", "paragraphs": ["According to TSA, pipelines are vulnerable to physical attacks\u2014including  the use of firearms or explosives\u2014largely due to their stationary nature,  the volatility of transported products, and the dispersed nature of pipeline  networks spanning urban and outlying areas. The nature of the  transported commodity and the potential effect of an attack on national  security, commerce, and public health make some pipelines and their  assets more attractive targets for attack. Oil and gas pipelines have  been and continue to be targeted by terrorists and other malicious groups  globally. Terrorists have also targeted U.S. pipelines, but have not  succeeded in attacking them. Further, environmental activists and lone  actors seeking to halt the construction of new pipelines through sabotage  have recently emerged as a new threat to pipelines. For example, in  March 2017, activists used blowtorches to cut holes in empty portions of  the Dakota Access Pipeline in two states. In February 2017, local law  enforcement officers fatally shot a man who used an assault rifle to  damage the Sabal Trail Pipeline, a natural gas pipeline under  construction in Florida.", "The sophisticated computer systems that pipeline operations rely on are  also vulnerable to various cyber threats. According to DOE, the  frequency, scale, and sophistication of cyber threats have increased, and  attacks have become easier to launch. NCCIC reported that the energy  sector, which includes pipelines, experienced more cyber incidents than  any sector from 2013 to 2015, accounting for 35 percent of the 796  incidents reported by all critical infrastructure sectors. In 2016, NCCIC  reported that the energy sector was the third most frequently attacked  sector. Further, according to DOE, the cost of preventing and  responding to cyber incidents in the energy sector is straining the ability  of companies to adequately protect their critical cyber systems. For  example, a 2015 study by the Ponemon Institute estimated the  annualized cost of cyber crime for an average energy company to be  about $28 million.", "Ineffective protection of cyber assets from these threats can increase the  likelihood of security incidents and cyber attacks that disrupt critical  operations; lead to inappropriate access to and disclosure, modification,  or destruction of sensitive information; and threaten national security,  economic well-being, and public health and safety. Unintentional or  nonadversarial threat sources may include failures in equipment or  software due to aging, resource depletion, and errors made by end users.  They also include natural disasters and failures of critical infrastructure on  which the organization depends, but that are outside of the control of the  organization.", "Intentional or adversarial threats may include corrupt employees, criminal  groups, terrorists, and nations that seek to leverage the organization\u2019s  dependence on cyber resources (i.e., information in electronic form,  information and communications technologies, and the communications  and information-handling capabilities provided by those technologies).  These threat adversaries vary in terms of their capabilities, their  willingness to act, and their motives, which can include seeking monetary  gain or seeking an economic, political, or military advantage.", "Cyber threat adversaries make use of various techniques, tactics,  practices, and exploits to adversely affect an organization\u2019s computers,  software, or networks, or to intercept or steal valuable or sensitive  information. For example, an attacker could infiltrate a pipeline\u2019s  operational systems via the internet or other communication pathways to  potentially disrupt its service and cause spills, releases, explosions, or  fires. Moreover, ICS, which were once largely isolated from the Internet  and the company\u2019s information technology systems, are increasingly  connected in modern energy systems, allowing cyber attacks to originate  in business systems and migrate to operational systems. For example,  malicious nation-state actors used spear-phishing and other similar  approaches in 2018 against energy sector organizations to gain access to  their business systems, conduct reconnaissance, and collect information  about their ICS.

The directive also identifies the  16 critical infrastructure sectors and assigns roles and responsibilities  for each critical infrastructure sector among nine designated federal  sector-specific agencies.", "While PPD-21 identified the critical infrastructure sectors and assigned  responsibility for each sector\u2019s sector-specific agency, the NIPP outlines  critical infrastructure stakeholder roles and responsibilities regarding  critical security and resilience. It describes a voluntary partnership model  as the primary means of coordinating government and private sector  efforts to protect critical infrastructure. As part of the partnership structure,  the designated sector-specific agencies serve as the lead coordinators for  security programs of their respective sector. As sector-specific agencies,  federal departments or agencies lead, facilitate, or support the security  and resilience programs and associated activities of their designated  critical infrastructure sector. For example, DHS and DOT are both  designated as sector-specific agencies for the transportation systems  sector, which includes pipelines. Each sector also has a government  coordinating council, consisting of representatives from various levels of  government, and many have a sector coordinating council (SCC)  consisting of owner-operators of these critical assets or members of their  respective trade associations. For example, the Transportation  Government Coordinating Council has been established, and the Pipeline  Modal SCC has been established to represent pipeline operators.", "The NIPP also outlines a risk management framework for critical  infrastructure protection. As shown in Figure 3, the NIPP uses a risk  management framework as a planning methodology intended to inform  how decision makers take actions to manage risk. The risk management  framework calls for public and private critical infrastructure partners to  conduct risk assessments to understand the most likely and severe  incidents that could affect their operations and communities, and use this  information to support planning and resource allocation.", "According to DHS, the risk management framework is influenced by the  nature and magnitude of a threat, the vulnerabilities to that threat, and the  consequences that could result, as shown in Figure 4.", "Federal policy has encouraged voluntary information-sharing  mechanisms between the federal government and critical infrastructure  owners and operators. For example, Information Sharing and Analysis  Centers (ISAC) are formed by critical infrastructure owners and operators  to gather, analyze, appropriately sanitize, and disseminate intelligence  and information related to critical infrastructure. They typically collect,  analyze and disseminate actionable threat information to their members  and provide members with tools to mitigate risks and enhance resiliency.  ISACs in which pipeline operators may participate have been formed  including the Oil and Natural Gas ISAC, Downstream Natural Gas ISAC,  and Electricity ISAC.", "Finally, in February 2013, the president issued Executive Order 13636,  Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, which cited repeated  cyber intrusions into critical infrastructure as demonstrating the need for  improved cybersecurity. Executive Order 13636 outlined actions for  improving critical infrastructure cybersecurity, including direction for the  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to lead the  development of a voluntary risk-based cybersecurity framework that  would comprise a set of industry standards and best practices to help  organizations manage cybersecurity risks. NIST issued the framework  in 2014 and updated it in April 2018. The order also addressed the need to improve cybersecurity information sharing and collaboratively develop  risk-based standards and stated that U.S. policy was to increase the  volume, timeliness, and quality of cyber threat information shared with  private sector entities so that these entities may better protect and defend  themselves against cyber threats."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Pipeline Stakeholders\u2019 Security Roles and Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["Protecting the nation\u2019s pipeline systems is a responsibility shared by both  the federal government and private industry.

According to the TSOC\u2019s operating procedures, if a reported incident  meets certain criteria, such as the incident was intended to or resulted in  damage or requires a general evacuation of a facility, the TSOC watch  officer is then to contact Office of Security and Industry Engagement  officials. According to TSA officials, the TSOC does not conduct  investigations of the specific security incidents that pipeline operators  report.

As discussed previously, four of the five  NSTS measures are based on the percentage of critical pipeline  systems implementing TSA\u2019s Pipeline Security Guidelines. The  management measure is based on the number of complete pipeline  security reviews. The CFSR status database measures are based on  the percentage of recommendations implemented overall and by  groups. Finally, the CSR goals and priorities database measures are  based on the average compliance percentage of companies that had  CSRs conducted in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. This is similar to four  of the five NSTS measures. Significantly overlapping measures may  lead to redundant, costly information that does not add value for TSA  management.", "Linkage. The pipeline-related measures in the 2018 NSTS generally  exhibited this key attribute. For example, all of the NSTS measures  were arranged by agency strategic goals and risk-based priorities.  However, the management measure in DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2019  congressional budget justification and the CFSR status database  measures did not specify the TSA goals and priorities to which they  were aligned. If measures are not aligned with division and agency- wide goals and mission, the behaviors and incentives created by  these measures do not support achieving those goals or mission.", "Measurable target. TSA\u2019s measures generally did not include  measurable targets in the form of a numerical goal and none of the  NSTS measures had measurable targets. For example, the NSTS  measure under the Security Planning priority, which tracks the  percentage of critical pipeline systems implementing TSA\u2019s Pipeline  Security Guidelines, does not state what specific percentages would  be considered an improvement in industry security plans. However,  the management measure did include target numbers of pipeline  security reviews by fiscal year. Both the CFSR status database  measures and CSR goals and priorities database measures did not  include measurable targets. Without measurable targets, TSA cannot  tell if performance is meeting expectations.", "Objectivity. Because the pipeline-related measures in the 2018  NSTS, the CFSR status database, and the CSR goals and priorities  database generally lack clarity and measurable targets, TSA cannot  ensure its measures are free from bias or manipulation, and therefore,  are not objective. If measures are not objective, the results of  performance assessments may be systematically overstated or  understated.", "Reliability. Because the pipeline-related measures in the 2018 NSTS,  the CFSR status database, and the CSR goals and priorities database  generally lack clarity, measurable targets, and baseline and trend  data, it is not clear if TSA\u2019s measures produce the same result under  similar conditions; therefore, the pipeline-related measures are  unreliable. If measures are not reliable, reported performance data  may be inconsistent and add uncertainty.", "Baseline and trend data. TSA\u2019s measures generally did not include  baseline and trend data. For example, none of the NSTS measures  included past results and compared them to measurable targets. TSA  officials were unable to identify measures or goals to assess the  extent to which pipeline operators have fully implemented the  guidelines or increased pipeline security, but did say developing a  feedback mechanism to measure progress in closing vulnerability  gaps was important. However, the management measure did include  the number of completed pipeline security reviews for each fiscal year  from 2014 through 2017, as well as numerical goals. The CFSR  status database includes information on CFSRs conducted from May  22, 2012, through June 29, 2017, but the measures are calculated for  the entire time period rather than year-by-year. The CSR goals and  priorities database measures include percentage compliance with the  guidelines for CSRs conducted in fiscal years 2016 and 2017, as well  as a combined measure. However, baseline and trend data are not  tracked or reported in either database. Collecting, tracking,  developing, and reporting baseline and trend data allows agencies to  better evaluate progress being made and whether or not goals are  being achieved.", "Pipeline Security Branch officials explained that in addition to the  measures reported in the 2018 NSTS Pipeline Security Plan, they  primarily rely on measures assessing CSR and CFSR implementation for  assessing the value of its pipeline security program. TSA officials  reported that they collect and analyze data and information collected from  CSRs and CFSRs to, among other things, determine strengths and  weaknesses at critical pipeline facilities, areas to target for risk reduction  strategies, and pipeline industry implementation of the voluntary Pipeline  Security Guidelines. For example, TSA officials reported that they  analyzed information from approximately 734 CFSR recommendations  that were made during fiscal years 2012 through 2016. They found that  pipeline operators had made the strongest improvements in security  training, public awareness outreach and law enforcement coordination,  and site specific security measures. The most common areas in need of  improvement were 24x7 monitoring, frequency of security vulnerability  assessments, and proper signage.", "However, as described above, we found those measures also did not  comport with key attributes for successful measures and we report below  on reliability concerns for underlying data supporting those measures. In  addition, while the Pipeline Security Branch may not rely on the measures  included in the 2018 NSTS Pipeline Security Plan and the fiscal year  2019 congressional budget justification, they are important for reporting  the status of pipeline security efforts to TSA as a whole and to external  stakeholders such as Congress.", "Taking steps to ensure that the pipeline security program performance  measures exhibit key attributes of successful performance measures  could allow TSA to better assess the program\u2019s effectiveness at reducing  pipeline physical and cybersecurity risks. This could include steps such  as modifying its suite of measures so they are clear, have measurable  targets, and add baseline and trend data. Further examples include the  following:", "Adding measurable targets consisting of numerical goals could allow  TSA to better determine if the pipeline security program is meeting  expectations. For example, measurable targets could be added to  TSA\u2019s existing measures by developing annual goals for the  percentage of recommendations implemented to the CFSR status  database and then reporting annual results.", "To make measures clearer, TSA could verify that each measure has a  clearly stated name, definition, and methodology for how the measure  is calculated. For example, the NSTS objective for security training  mentioned above could have more specific language explaining how  the measure is calculated and whether it applies to pipeline operators\u2019  implementation of the training-related portions of the TSA Pipeline  Security Guidelines or overall implementation.", "Finally, adding baseline and trend data could allow TSA to identify,  monitor, and report changes in performance and help ensure that  performance is viewed in context. For example, the NSTS measures,  CFSR status database measures, and CSR goals and priorities  database measures could have annual results from prior years.

However, TSA has not tracked the status of CSR recommendations for  over 5 years and related security review data are not sufficiently reliable.", "When conducting CSRs and CFSRs, TSA staff makes recommendations  to operators, if appropriate. For example, a CSR recommendation might  include a suggestion to conduct annual security-related drills and  exercises, and a CFSR recommendation might include a suggestion to  install barbed wire on the main gate of a pipeline facility. In response to  recommendations that we made in our 2010 report, TSA developed three  databases to track CSR and CFSR recommendations and their  implementation status by pipeline facility, system, operator, and product  type. In addition, the agency recently developed a fourth database to  collect and analyze information gathered from pipeline operators\u2019  responses to CSR questions. TSA officials reported that they use this  database to assess the extent that TSA\u2019s pipeline security program has  met NSTS goals and Pipeline Security Branch priorities. TSA officials  stated that they use the CSR goals and priorities database for follow-up  on recommendations, indications of improvement in pipeline security, and  as an input into TSA performance goals and measures, including the  performance measures for the 2018 NSTS Pipeline Security Plan.", "We found several problems with the databases that indicate that the  pipeline security program data are not sufficiently reliable and do not  provide quality information that is current, complete, and accurate. First,  the CSR recommendations database only included information for  reviews conducted from November 2010 through February 2013. TSA  officials stated that the agency stopped capturing CSR recommendations  and status information in 2014. A TSA official stated that one factor was  that the pipeline staffing level was one FTE in fiscal year 2014. However,  the Pipeline Security Branch did not resume entering CSR  recommendation-related information when staffing levels rose to 6 FTEs  in the following year and beyond. As a result, TSA is missing over 5 years  of data for the recommendations it made to pipeline operators when  conducting CSRs.", "The agency collected some information from CSRs conducted in fiscal  years 2016 and 2017 in the separate CSR goals and priorities database.  However, this database does not include all of the information that TSA  collects when conducting CSRs. Specifically, the CSR goals and priorities  database does not state which companies were reviewed, what specific  recommendations were made, or the current status of those  recommendations, and only records operators\u2019 responses to 79 of the  222 CSR questions.", "Second, our review identified instances of missing data, inconsistent data  entry formats, and data entry errors in the four databases. For example:", "The CSR recommendations database had missing data in all 13 of the  included fields and a data entry error shifted 50 observations into the  wrong fields, impacting both the Status Date and Completion Code  fields.", "The CSR goals and priorities database had seven entries with  inconsistent data formatting and five of those entries were not taken  into account when calculating summary figures.", "The CFSR recommendations database had missing data in 3 of 9  fields. There was also inconsistent data entry formats in 3 fields.", "The CFSR status database had missing data in 7 of 29 fields and  inconsistent data entry formats in 4 fields.", "Finally, TSA has not documented its data entry and verification  procedures, such as in a data dictionary or user manual, and does not  have electronic safeguards for out-of-range or inconsistent entries for any  of the databases it uses to track the status of CSR or CFSR  recommendations and analyze operator responses to the CSR. TSA  Pipeline Security Branch officials told us that they had not documented  data entry and verification procedures and did not have electronic  safeguards. This was for two reasons. First, the officials stated that the  databases are small and maintained in a commercial spreadsheet  program that does not allow for electronic safeguards. However, based  on our review of the databases, the spreadsheet program does allow for a  variety of electronic safeguards. For example, entries can be restricted to  only allow selections from a drop-down list or only allow dates to be  entered. Second, only a small number of TSA employees enter  information into these databases. TSA officials explained that typically  one TSA employee is responsible for entering information from pipeline  security reviews, and another individual, usually whoever conducted the  review, is tasked to verify the accuracy of the data entered. As a result,  according to the officials, any errors would be self-evident and caught  during these TSA employees\u2019 reviews.", "Our work has emphasized the importance of quality information for  management to make informed decisions and evaluate agencies\u2019  performance in achieving key objectives and addressing risks. The  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  management should use quality information to achieve agency objectives,  where \u201cquality\u201d means, among other characteristics, current, complete,  and accurate. In addition, DHS\u2019s Information Quality Guidelines state  that all DHS component agencies should treat information quality as  integral to every step of the development of information, including  creation, collection, maintenance, and dissemination.

Until TSA  monitors and records the status of these reviews\u2019 recommendations, it will  be hindered in its efforts to determine whether its recommendations are  leading to significant reduction in risk. By entering information on CSR  recommendations and monitoring and recording their status, developing  written documentation of its data entry and verification procedures and  electronic safeguards, and improving the quality of its pipeline security  program data, TSA could better ensure it has the information necessary  to effectively monitor pipeline operators\u2019 progress in improving their  security posture, and evaluate its pipeline security program\u2019s   effectiveness in reducing security risks to pipelines."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["A successful pipeline attack could have dire consequences on public  health and safety, as well as the U.S. economy.

However, without a  documented process defining how frequently TSA is to review and, if  deemed necessary, revise its guidelines, TSA cannot ensure that its  guidelines reflect the latest known standards and best practices for  physical and cybersecurity, or address the persistent and dynamic  security threat environment currently facing the nation\u2019s pipeline system.  Further, without clearly defined criteria for determining pipeline facilities\u2019  criticality, TSA cannot ensure that pipeline operators are applying  guidance uniformly and that all of the critical facilities across the pipeline  sector have been identified; or that their vulnerabilities have been  identified and addressed.", "TSA could improve its ability to conduct pipeline security reviews and the  means that it uses to prioritize which pipeline systems to review based on  their relative risk ranking.

The risk assessment calculates threat,  vulnerability, and consequence on variables such as the amount of  throughput in the pipeline system (consequence input). Pipeline Security  Branch officials told us that they use the pipeline risk assessment to rank  relative risk of the top 100 critical pipeline systems, and the standard  operating procedures for conducting Corporate Security Reviews (CSR)  state the results of the risk ranking are the primary factor considered  when prioritizing CSRs of pipeline companies.", "However, we identified several factors that likely limit the usefulness of  the current assessment in calculating threat, vulnerability, and  consequence to allow the Pipeline Security Branch to effectively prioritize  reviews of pipeline systems. For example, because the risk assessment  has not changed since 2014, information on threat may be outdated.  Additionally, sources of data and underlying assumption and judgments  regarding certain threat and vulnerability inputs to the assessment are not  fully documented. For example, threats to cybersecurity are not  specifically accounted for in the description of the risk assessment  methodology, making it unclear if cybersecurity is part of the  assessment\u2019s threat factor. Further, the risk assessment does not include  information that is consistent with the National Infrastructure Protection  Plan (NIPP) and other Department of Homeland Security (DHS) priorities  for critical infrastructure risk mitigation, such as information on natural  hazards and the ability to measure risk reduction (feedback data).", "According to Pipeline Security Branch officials, the risk ranking  assessment is not intended to be a fully developed risk model detailing all pipeline factors influencing risk. Rather, officials said they are primarily  interested in assessing risk data that impacts security. However, because  TSA\u2019s Pipeline Security Program is designed to enhance the security  preparedness of the pipeline systems, incorporating additional factors that  enhance security into their risk calculation of the most critical pipeline  systems would better align their efforts with Presidential Policy Directive  21 (PPD-21). For example, PPD-21 calls for agencies to integrate and  analyze information to prioritize assets and manage risks to critical  infrastructure, as well as anticipate interdependencies and cascading  impacts.", "Below we present the various shortfalls in the risk assessment\u2014outdated  data, limited description of sources and methodology, and opportunities to  better align with the NIPP and other DHS priorities for critical  infrastructure risk mitigation\u2014in the context of the components that  comprise a risk assessment: threat, vulnerability, and consequence.

First, while the risk assessment assesses  consequence and vulnerability by pipeline system through use of multiple  variables, it currently ranks threat for pipeline systems equally. Second,  the evolving nature of threats to pipelines may not be reflected, since the  risk assessment was last updated in 2014. Third, the threat calculation  does not take into account natural hazards.", "Pipeline Security Branch officials said they currently rank threat equally  across pipeline systems because they do not have granular enough  threat information to distinguish threat by pipeline. However, ranking  threat equally effectively has no effect on the risk calculation for pipeline  systems. Further, this judgment is not documented in the risk  assessment\u2019s methodology. According to the NIPP, a risk assessment\u2019s  methodology must clearly document what information is used and how it  is synthesized to generate a risk estimate, including any assumptions and  judgments. Additionally, our analysis of the pipeline risk assessment  found that it includes at least one field that TSA could use to differentiate  threat by pipeline. Specifically, the risk assessment includes a field that  accounts for whether a pipeline experienced a previous security threat  (including failed attacks), and information provided by Pipeline Security  Branch suggests some pipeline systems have experienced such threats.", "However, the Pipeline Security Branch did not capture these events in the  risk assessment\u2019s calculation, which Pipeline Security Branch officials  said should be part of the threat calculation, but could not account for why  they were not calculated for the systems in the risk assessment. These  officials also clarified that incidents such as suspicious photography or  vandalism do not constitute an attack to be accounted for in the threat  calculation. Documenting such assumptions, judgments, or decisions to  exclude information could provide increased transparency to those  expected to interpret or use the results.", "Pipeline Security Branch officials also said that they ranked threat equally  because TSA Intelligence and Analysis data show that threats to the oil  and natural gas sector have been historically low, and Intelligence and  Analysis does not conduct specific threat analysis against individual  pipeline systems. However, the Pipeline Security Branch has not updated  the risk assessment since June 2014; therefore, the threat information it  used to determine threat calculations\u2014and decide to rank threat  equally\u2014may be outdated and not reflect the threats to the industry that  have emerged in recent years. In fact, pipeline operators we interviewed  indicated that the types of threats that concern pipeline operators have  evolved. For example, 5 of the 10 operators we interviewed indicated that  environmental activists were an increased threat to the pipeline industry  because they use sabotage techniques, such as valve turning and cutting  in service pipelines with blow torches, against pipelines. Additionally, 6 of  10 pipeline operators we interviewed said cyber attacks from nation-state  actors were a primary threat to their industry. Further, when TSA issued  its revised Pipeline Security Guidelines in March 2018, it stated that its  revisions to the guidelines were made to reflect the ever-changing threat  environment in both the physical and cybersecurity realms. However,  threats to cybersecurity are not specifically accounted for in the  description of the risk assessment methodology. Recent Pipeline Modal  and Cyber Modal Threat Assessments include cyber threats to the  pipeline industry, but the description of the pipeline risk assessment\u2019s  methodology does not specify what types of threat assessments  (sources) are used to calculate its threat score. To better align with the  guidance in the NIPP for documenting sources of information when  conducting risk assessments, the Pipeline Security Branch should  document the information used. Keeping the risk assessment updated  with current information, as well as documenting those data sources,  could help the Pipeline Security Branch ensure it is using its limited  resources to review the pipeline systems with greater risk.", "Natural Hazard Threats to Pipelines  The Transportation Systems Sector, of which  pipelines are a part, is critical to the Pacific  Northwest, but also at risk from natural  hazards, like earthquakes. For example,  according to the Department of Homeland  Security, an earthquake in the Puget Sound  region\u2014which relies on the transportation of  crude oil from Alaska\u2014could cripple the ports  of Seattle and Tacoma, as well as the  Olympic and Williams Pipelines greatly  impacting the Pacific Northwest Economic  Region.  Hurricanes are the most frequent disruptive  natural hazard for the oil and natural gas  subsector and can cause the shutdown of  facilities in an area, even when the facilities  themselves are not directly affected by the  storms. For example, according to the U.S.  Energy Information Administration, the flow of  petroleum into the New York area via pipeline  from the Gulf Coast relies on the ability to  move it through major terminals. In August  2017, Hurricane Harvey caused major  disruptions to crude oil and petroleum product  supply chains, including those to New York  Harbor from Houston, Texas via the Colonial  Pipeline. Due to the hurricane, decreased  supplies of petroleum products available for  the pipeline in Houston forced Colonial  Pipeline to limit operations temporarily.", "Finally, another shortfall in the current pipeline risk assessment  methodology is that it does not account for natural hazards in its threat  calculation, even though DHS\u2019s definition of threat includes natural  hazards, and security and resilience of critical infrastructure are often  presented in the context of natural hazards. According to the NIPP,  threat is a natural or manmade occurrence, individual, entity, or action  that has or indicates the potential to harm life, information, operations, the  environment, and/or property. As such, along with terrorism, criminal  activity and cybersecurity, natural disasters are a key element of DHS\u2019s  critical infrastructure security and resilience mission.", "According to Pipeline Security Branch officials, there is not sufficient  historical data available that would indicate a significant impact from  natural disasters on specific pipeline systems. However, we identified  possible sources of data for the Pipeline Security Branch to consider. For  example, a 2016 RAND Corporation study examined national  infrastructure systems\u2019 exposure to natural hazards, including pipelines.  Additionally, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has  collaborated with stakeholders to develop the National Risk Index to,  among other things, establish a baseline of natural hazards risk for the  United States While there may not be historical data of natural hazard  impact for every pipeline system, consulting other sources or experts  could provide regional data or analysis to build a more comprehensive  threat picture to help distinguish threats by pipeline system. According to  the NIPP, hazard assessments should rely not only on historical  information, but also future predictions about natural hazards to assess  the likelihood or frequency of various hazards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Vulnerability", "paragraphs": ["We also identified multiple shortfalls in the vulnerability factors used in the  risk assessment methodology, such as the potential uncertainty of the  number of critical facilities and incorporating a feedback mechanism to  calculate overall risk reduction. Other considerations for vulnerability  calculations include physical condition of the pipeline system,  cybersecurity activities, and interdependencies among sectors.", "The number of critical facilities a pipeline system has identified is used as  an input for its vulnerability calculation in the Pipeline Security Branch\u2019s  risk assessment methodology. As discussed earlier, we identified  deficiencies in TSA\u2019s criteria for identifying critical facilities, and found that  well-defined criteria and consistent application of the criteria for identifying  critical facilities could improve the results of the Pipeline Security  Branch\u2019s risk assessment. Nevertheless, communicating in the risk  assessment the uncertainty that may be inherent in this self-reported  information would better align the risk assessment with the NIPP.", "Measuring Effectiveness in a Voluntary  Environment  According to the National Infrastructure  Protection Plan, the use of performance  metrics is an important step in the critical  infrastructure risk management process to  enable assessment of improvements in critical  infrastructure security and resilience. The  metrics provide a basis for the critical  infrastructure community to establish  accountability, document actual performance,  promote effective management, and provide a  feedback mechanism to inform decision  making.  By using metrics to evaluate the effectiveness  of voluntary partnership efforts to achieve  national and sector priorities, critical  infrastructure partners can adjust and adapt  their security and resilience approaches to  account for progress achieved, as well as  changes in the threat and other relevant  environments. Metrics are used to focus  attention on areas of security and resilience  that warrant additional resources or other  changes through an analysis of challenges  and priorities at the national, sector, and  owner/operator levels.  Metrics also serve as a feedback mechanism  for other aspects of the critical infrastructure  risk management approach.", "Another shortfall in the risk assessment is its inability to reliably measure  the progress a pipeline system made in addressing vulnerability gaps  between security reviews. The current risk assessment includes a CSR  score as part of its vulnerability calculation, which was developed in part  in response to our 2010 recommendation to use more reliable data to  measure a pipeline system\u2019s vulnerability gap. However, during our  review, Pipeline Security Branch officials said they plan to remove  pipeline companies\u2019 CSR scores from the risk assessment calculations,  because they and industry partners do not have confidence that the score  appropriately measures a pipeline system\u2019s vulnerability. For example,  Pipeline Security Branch officials explained that pipeline companies  consider security factors differently, which can lead to variation in  implementing risk reduction activities and by extension lead to different  CSR scores. However, removing the CSR score eliminates the only  feedback mechanism in the risk assessment from a pipeline company\u2019s  actual security review conducted by the Pipeline Security Branch. The  NIPP and DHS\u2019s Risk Management fundamentals emphasize the  important role that such feedback mechanisms play in risk management.  Officials from the Pipeline Security Branch agree on the importance of a  feedback mechanism tying results of reviews to a revised vulnerability  metric, but said they need a better measure than the current CSR score  which is unreliable for comparative and analytic purposes. Developing a  feedback mechanism based on implementation of TSA\u2019s Pipeline Security  Guidelines could be an important input to the risk assessment\u2019s  vulnerability calculation. This information would also inform the amount of  risk pipeline companies are reducing by implementing the guidelines and  could be used to inform overall risk reduction.", "The physical and cyber environments in which the pipeline sector  operates also present vulnerabilities not accounted for in the pipeline risk  assessment. In recent years, DHS has listed the potential for catastrophic  losses to dramatically increase the overall risk associated with failing  infrastructure and highlighted risks due to climate change and natural  hazards to pipelines. For example, DHS reported extreme  temperatures\u2014such as higher and lower temperatures over prolonged  periods of time\u2014increase vulnerability to the critical infrastructure by  causing elements to break and cease to function. Pipelines that freeze  and then rupture can affect the energy and transportation systems  sectors. As noted above, according to the NIPP, a natural or man-made  occurrence or action with the potential to harm life is considered a threat,  whereas vulnerability is defined as a physical feature or operational  attribute that renders an entity open to exploitation or susceptible to a  given threat or hazard. While pipeline physical condition is typically  thought of in context of safety, pipeline condition or location (such as  above or below ground) could touch upon pipeline security as it relates to  system vulnerability. For example, a pipeline system or segment of a  system with a compromised physical condition due to corrosion or age  could affect the system\u2019s vulnerability to threats and affect its ability to  recover from such threats by potentially increasing the time a system is  offline.", "According to the Transportation Systems Sector-Specific Plan,  vulnerabilities to damage in aging transportation infrastructure\u2014of which  pipelines are a part\u2014are projected to increase with the continued effects  of climate change. Further, according to TSA\u2019s Pipeline Security and  Incident Recovery Protocol Plan, pipeline integrity efforts\u2014including the  design, construction, operation, and maintenance of pipelines\u2014are  important to pipeline security because well-maintained, safe pipelines are  more likely to tolerate a physical attack. The Pipeline Security Branch  already collects information from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials  Safety Administration (PHMSA) for its risk assessment, specifically  information on High Consequence Area and High Threat Urban Area  mileage. By considering additional information PHMSA collects on  pipeline integrity, the Pipeline Security Branch could also use the  information to help pipeline operators identify security measures to help  reduce the consequences related to the comparatively higher vulnerability  of an aging or compromised system. This would align with the Pipeline  Security Branch\u2019s efforts to improve security preparedness of pipeline  systems and could better inform its vulnerability calculations for relative  risk ranking of pipeline systems.", "Capturing cybersecurity in the risk assessment is also an area for  improvement. Pipeline Security Branch officials told us they consulted  with the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center  to revise TSA\u2019s Pipeline Security Guidelines to align with the National  Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework  and that absent data specific to pipelines on their cybersecurity  vulnerabilities, they are unable to include a pipelines\u2019 vulnerability to  cyber attack in the risk assessment. However, the Pipeline Security  Branch recently updated the security review questions asked of pipeline  operators during corporate and critical facility reviews based on the  recently updated Pipeline Security Guidelines. Using these updated  questions related to companies\u2019 cybersecurity posture, the Pipeline  Security Branch could collect additional information on cybersecurity  vulnerabilities which could inform the risk assessment. This could be an  element of the feedback mechanism described above and emphasized in  the NIPP. Additionally, NIST identified several supply chain vulnerabilities  associated with cybersecurity, which are not currently accounted for in  TSA\u2019s Pipeline Security Guidelines. As pipeline operators implement increasing levels of network technologies to control their systems, the  Pipeline Security Branch may not be fully accounting for pipeline systems\u2019  cybersecurity posture by not including the cybersecurity-related  vulnerabilities in its risk assessment inputs.", "Finally, we identified shortfalls in cross-sector interdependencies, which  could affect vulnerability calculations. According to the NIPP,  understanding and addressing risks from cross-sector dependencies and  interdependencies is essential to enhancing critical infrastructure security  and resilience. The Pipeline Security Branch\u2019s pipeline risk assessment  currently considers the effects of a pipeline system\u2019s ability to service  assets such as major airports, the electric grid, and military bases.  However, consequence is calculated on the loss or disruption of the  pipeline system to these other assets and does not capture the  dependency of the pipeline system on other energy sources, such as  electricity. Weather events such as Gulf of Mexico hurricanes and  Superstorm Sandy highlighted the interdependencies between the  pipeline and electrical sectors. Specifically, according to a 2015 DHS  annual report on critical infrastructure, power failures during Superstorm  Sandy in 2012 closed major pipelines for 4 days, reducing regional oil  supplies by 35 to 40 percent. The report goes on to say that the  interconnected nature of infrastructure systems can lead to cascading  impacts and are increasing in frequency. Pipeline Security Branch  officials are considering cross-sector interdependencies and said they  discuss these factors with operators as they relate to system resiliency.  Considering interdependencies of sectors in both directions\u2014such as  calculating the likelihood that an input like electricity could fail and cause  disruptions to critical pipelines\u2014could improve the calculations in the  pipeline risk assessment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consequence", "paragraphs": ["As previously discussed, the Pipeline Security Branch last calculated  relative risk among the top 100 pipeline systems in 2014. When doing so,  it used pipeline systems\u2019 throughput data from 2010 to assess relative  risk. According to Pipeline Security Branch officials, the amount of  throughput in pipeline systems does not change substantially year to  year. However, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  calls for management to use quality information to achieve the entity\u2019s  objectives, including using relevant data from reliable sources obtained in  a timely manner. The Pipeline Security Branch uses throughput data as a  consequence factor in the risk assessment to determine a pipeline  system\u2019s relative risk score.
